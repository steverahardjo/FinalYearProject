                "The present invention relates to a hand-utility interface that is wearable on the hand of a user. In a preferred aspect, the present invention relates to a hand-utility interface for receipt of or incorporating utility or tool attachments, such as, for example, attachments suitable for use in cleaning and grooming applications.Most of the cleaning tools presently available rely on a user directly holding an independent interface, such as a cloth, sponge or handle of the common bristle brush. In such cases, the user's hand is unprotected whilst conducting the task. Additionally, much of the innate dexterity of the user's hand, in particular, the user's fingers, is lost. Furthermore if the user resorts to using utility gloves they are faced with the inconvenience of struggling to pull on and pull off the gloves and need to use both hands for this and any toxic, caustic or messy materials on the gloves can be touched or spread when pulling on or removing the gloves.It is an object of the present invention to provide a wearable hand-utility interface, which is easier put on and take off than a glove and yet reliably protects the hand of a user during the undertaking of various utility tasks (e.g. cleaning, grooming). It is another object of the present invention to provide such a wearable hand-utility interface, which affords the user more of the dexterity of the user's hand, such that the interface can form itself to meet any surface, regardless of its complexity. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a hand-utility interface, which allows the hand to be clenched, for example, for wringing out liquid from the interface, without causing discomfort to the wearer. It is a still further object of the invention to provide a hand-utility interface, which is adaptable for use with different sizes of hand and different lengths of finger.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a hand-utility interface for use in protecting a user's hand during utility tasks comprising a flexible body having a first major face (eg upper in use face) with a plurality of finger-receiving channels defined therein, whereby a user may insert their hand to wear the interface by pressing their hand down over that first major face so that the fingers enter the finger-receiving channels. Preferably at least one of the finger-receiving channels has spaced apart opposing sidewalls configured to flex wider apart to receive a finger of the user's hand and resiliently close thereagainst such that in use, the finger-receiving channel secures the interface to the user's hand.The term ‘hand-utility interface’ (or simply ‘interface’) herein is used to mean a wearable item, which protects the underside of the hand of a user during the undertaking of various utility tasks (e.g. cleaning, grooming, sanding, waxing or dyeing) and is quite distinct from any mere cloth, block or pad (which is not wearable) and from any utility glove (which envelope the user's hand). It is also quite distinct from a body-cleaning mitten/bath mitt or over-sized slitted foam ‘comedy hand’. The ‘interface’ provides an interface between the user's hand and the utility media, which in aspects comprises a utility tool or utility consumable (eg. cleaning or polishing media) for use in performing a utility task with a high level of dexterity/conformity to the object or surface to be operated on.The hand-utility interface protects the underside of the user's hand, and especially the underside, and suitably also, sides of the user's fingers where the user's hand would otherwise contact the utility media with which the user is working or surface on which the user is working but unlike a glove it does not wholly envelope the top-side, ie back, of the user's hand/fingers. The hand-utility interface herein is shaped to accommodate its putting on by the user such as in a one-handed operation that enhances ease and speed of user “pick up”. This contrasts with the operation to put on most traditional gloves, which is a two handed operation. The interface can be donned (picked up/put on) and doffed (taken off) without needing to be rolled up or peeled off, unlike a utility glove and thus is both easier to don and doff and can also avoid spreading of materials from the interface in the process.In aspects, the hand-utility interface is designed to afford maximum comfort to the hand whilst maximising the work area covered by the hand and the efficiency of the cleaning task. Suitably, the hand-utility interface is adaptable for use with user's hands of varying sizes. As noted above, typically, the interface acts to part-enclose the user's hand. It covers the underside of the users' fingers and preferably at least part of the user's palm but leaves much of the top (back) of the user's hand and fingers uncovered. This provides enhanced user utility in terms of ease of hand and finger movements and also facilitates donning and doffing the interface.In one aspect, the hand-utility interface is designed such that it covers only that part of the palm that can be comfortably reached by the fingers. When the interface comprises absorbent media, this provides the function that the interface can be efficiently wrung out by a simple clenching of the fist.The hand-utility interface comprises a body. The body has essentially two functions. Firstly, it provides a degree of protection to the user's hand whilst conducting utility tasks. Secondly it provides a support for the application of utility media by the hand. Suitably, the body provides a support for suitable utility media, but flexes to allow movement of the hand. Preferably, the body is shaped to provide a uniform, e.g. flat work surface (i.e. utility surface) that typically takes the form of a continuous pad in use, locating under the hand of the user. This contrasts with the non-uniform, rounded form, work surface provided by the un-gloved palm and underside of fingers of a user's hand.The body is preferably generally comprised of a foamed or sponge-like material. The material suitably comprises a synthetic polymer material that has a foamed structure (i.e. comprising foamed bubble features). In essence, suitable foam materials are those that offer the characteristics of ‘sponge’ such as its natural give and crushability, resilience and ability to absorb and carry liquid media. Suitable materials include ‘open foam’, where the individual bubbles are incomplete spheres, and ‘closed foam, where the spheres are complete, this latter type having considerably less water absorption ability. The body may have a block form. That is to say, overall it may have a generally block-like three-dimensional form. The body has plural (generally, four) finger-receiving channels defined therein. The finger-receiving channels may be provided to the block form body in any suitable manner including cutting out the channels or by injection-moulding the form of the body with the finger-receiving channels defined therein.In one particular aspect, the body is produced by injection moulding using visco-elastic foam (e.g. slow recovery foam). This process is especially suitable for producing a durable product that might have bristles or any other type of cleaning media applied.In a variation herein, the body is injected with visco-elastic foam. This variation allows that the side walls of the finger-receiving channels may in use, close over the top surface of a user's finger a little and significantly aid retention. It also renders the form of the body more flexible still and expandable, so better to deal with a greater variety of hand sizes and give great comfort to the wearer. The surface of the body that in use, contacts the palm of the user (the ‘palm piece’) might be flat, or it might be domed better to locate it under the hand for added user comfort. In one aspect, the ‘palm piece’ extends back to equal the extent that the fingers of the user's hand reach when closed against the user's palm. This aspect is particularly suitable for versions of the interface designed to enable a wringing out action.In another aspect, the ‘palm piece’ is longer and extends further towards the wrist so that it covers the whole of the palm of the user's hand, and potentially extends further still, depending upon the resilience of the foam and its ability effectively to carry media for useful work. This aspect is particularly suitable for versions of the interface that are designed to carry a disposable wipe.In one aspect, the body is also shaped such that in a line, more or less ahead of the second finger-receiving channel (i.e. that channel that in use, receives the second finger of a user), the form of the body produces a soft 90 degree angle, the lines of which are interrupted by the finger tip protecting ends of the body for the index and third fingers. The purpose is to produce a form that is good at getting into corners, for example where the wipe being used is for window cleaning. In use, the fingertip protecting ends of the body for the index and third fingers are suitably arranged to crush down, so providing, for example, a good form for sweeping a window frame immediately adjacent to the glass.Depending upon the nature of the selected body, the perimeter (plan view) of the interface may extend out to produce a surface considerably bigger than the hand. To do this and allow that the extreme of the perimeter has sufficient inherent strength to perform useful work may require a more rigid/stiffer foam type.In one aspect, the body is split between the finger-receiving channels to provide that each finger of a user can move independently of the others (i.e. each finger has its own foam channel). In another aspect, moisture and fluids in general can be prevented from rising up through the body (e.g. through the open cells of the foam) and reaching the user's hand by the addition of a waterproof barrier layer to the body (e.g. running horizontally through the body).In a further aspect, in order for the body to give the users hand more protection from the surface being worked upon and to enable the body to apply more aggressive work action, one or more rigid layers of material (e.g. in the form of a plate or plates) is provided to the body. In one example, the one or more rigid layers sandwiches between the base of the body and whatever work medium is required.The body can be produced from a foam block by a process known as “deformation cutting” or “form profile cutting”, which is a known process of manufacture for three dimensional cutting of block form bodies such as upholstery parts, automobile seat elements, packaging and other profiled parts out of flexible foams. The advantages of using such a process are high speed and economic production. In the process, the block-forming machine operates according to the compression system using templates (e.g. made out of aluminium). The template has a cavity of the desired shape of the block. The template is screwed onto table of the machine. The foam blank is placed onto the template. By means of a conveyor belt and a pressure roller, the foam blank is pressed into the template's cavity. The pressed foam is cut directly above the template during the automatic forward movement of the table. The cutting tool is a rotating band knife. In general terms, the deformation cutting process used to produce the foam block cannot produce undercuts.In certain circumstances, it is desirable to have undercuts in the form of tabs that extend from the top of the walls of the finger-receiving channels. In use, these tabs hang over the fingers of the user. Suitably, the user's fingers pass downwards past the tabs and the tabs then assume a position above each finger, thereby assisting retention of the body on the user's hand.If however, the block form body is produced in two parts, split through a line running horizontally at the point where the walls begin to widen towards their base, and if those two parts were then welded together, then the desired over hanging tabs could be provided. Further, the two parts of the block may be produced in materials of differing strengths, thereby giving extra control over its physical characteristics. In another aspect, suitable over finger tabs are produced by stamp cutting a partially flexible membrane to be welded on top of the walls of the finger-receiving channels and in places protrude/extend out over one or more of the channels. Such a stamp cut membrane would likely be in one single piece, each element connected to the other at the fingertip locations.Suitably, the hand-utility interface herein is arranged to cooperate with those elements common to all sizes of user hands. It is suitably configured to offer a fit for the majority (e.g. 90%+) of all adult hand sizes. Traditional glove forms account for this variable by offering different sizes of product or by use of stretch fabrics, whereas the present interface does so by providing means for securing the interface to a user's hand.In aspects, the interface is adapted to have ambidextrous form. That is to say, a universal fit form where it is configured to work for either left or right hand. The applicant has noted that there can be a problem with an ambidextrous form of the block form body: It is that in use, neither the third or fourth fingers of the user fully reach the end of their respective finger-receiving channels, for either the left or the right hand. In effect, the vacant space in the relevant finger-receiving channel moves from the right hand side of the block form body to the left hand side, depending upon which hand is applied. By way of one solution, a band (e.g. horseshoe shaped) is provided to the body at the tip of each finger-receiving channel. The band is resiliently crushable in form, for example comprising a soft-walled fluid-filled sack, able to be crushed at one point and so expand at another. In use, when a user's hand is inserted the band crushes, thereby resulting in filling up of the otherwise vacant channel space.Suitably, the natural tapering form of the user's hand/fingers is taken advantage of to provide for universal fit. The natural taper of the hand is present in two planes, namely that present on examination of the hand in plan view and that present in the side elevation.Each finger-receiving channel is sized and shaped to snugly receive a finger of a user. The snug receipt is assisted by the resilience characteristics of the material comprising the body, which mean that the walls of each finger-receiving channel tend to give as the finger is inserted and naturally adapt to any further finger movement to maintain snug finger-receipt.In one aspect, the means for securing the interface to a user's hand comprise palm support means for securing said interface to the palm of a user's hand and the finger-receiving channels for snugly receiving the fingers of the user's hand. In use, the palm support means and finger-receiving channels act in combination to secure the interface to the user's hand.In all embodiments of the interface each finger-receiving channel is not a mere slit but defines spaced apart opposing side walls to easily receive and partially encase a snugly received finger.Each side wall may either be a ‘divider wall’ that acts to divide a particular finger-receiving channel off from its adjacent neighbour (s) or a ‘perimeter wall’ that in use, locates adjacent to the outside of the first or fourth user fingers. The side walls may provide a finger support function, as a result of their resilient character. The sidewalls may however, also enable (and e.g. be shaped for) in use, grip by the fingers of the user. Thus, for example for any two adjacent finger-receiving channels (e.g. between the first and second, second and third or third and fourth fingers) the user may apply gripping force between his/her relevant fingers to the divider wall between the adjacent finger-receiving channels thereby gripping onto that divider wall.The finger channels in general, suitably have an elongate ‘U’ shape. In one, the finger channels are tapered along the channel. This tapering form is designed to assist user insertion of his/her fingers into each channel. In another aspect, the uppermost portion of the ‘U’ shaped channels closes in a little, better to close over the top part of the finger. Generally, the divider wails only extend back from the finger tip towards the palm so far as is allowed by the junction between fingers of a small, ladies hand.Generally, the walls of the finger channels need to be sufficiently high that the fingers of the small, ladies hand are completely concealed in side elevation. The wall height is generally also sufficient that at least two thirds of the big male finger depth is concealed in side elevation. Suitably, the walls rise high enough so that the users' fingers may ‘crimp together’ to grip the walls and so support the entire interface that is under the relevant fingers. In one variation, the walls of any or each finger channel are higher in one or more places and lower in one or more other places. In other variations, the walls of any or each finger channel are continuous or alternatively, intermittent. In a further variation, as an alternative to walls, there might be one or more upright elevations (e.g. stands) of suitable material. These elevations might be of any shape in plan and side view, but are most likely set to avoid abutment of the user's knuckle, in use. In a further variation, the right and left perimeter walls (i.e. those outer walls of the first and fourth finger channels) extend back further over the palm piece, in order to provide improved lateral stability of the palm piece in use.In aspects, any or each of the walls of the finger channels are arranged to rise up and return inwards such that on receipt of the users' fingers the tops of the walls partially close over the top of the fingers. The returning inwards action may occur at either one or both sides of the channel. In variations, the upper portion of the channels, as seen in and elevation, return in to partially cover over the upper surface of the finger to a greater or lesser degree. In one variation, the returning in action is arranged to be constant throughout the whole length of the finger channel. In another variation, this action is intermittent (i.e. appearing in some parts of the finger channel and not in others).Embodiments are envisaged in which one or more finger-channels are arranged to receive plural, particularly two, fingers of a user. In such embodiments it will be appreciated that the number of walls is necessarily fewer than in the standard four finger, three dividing walls, two perimeter walls embodiment.In one embodiment, each finger channel is arranged to receive two fingers. That is to say, a first finger channel receives the first and second fingers and a second finger channel receives third and fourth fingers. A single divider wall separates the first and second finger channels. In another embodiment, one finger channel is arranged to receive two fingers and two finger channels are arranged to receive a single finger. Divider walls separate each of the finger channels from its neighbour (s). Each of the , and  permutations is envisaged.The applicant has noted that a problem can arise in retaining the block form body to the user's hand and/or fingers, while the fist is clenched. By way of amelioration of the problem “V” incisions may be provided to the top of the walls of the finger-receiving channels. Alternatively, the volume of foamed body to be compressed when clenching the fist is reduced by providing depressions along the centre base of each finger-receiving channel. Alternatively, the volume of foamed body to be compressed when clenching the fist is reduced by providing “V” or “Square” shaped channels, running crosswise (i.e. perpendicular to the finger-receiving channels) in the underside of the base of the block form body (i.e. the working surface). This is achievable by the foamed body blank being run twice through the deformation cutting process. Such incisions might run below the finger channel base line or they might be set to run through the channels.Alternatively, one or more finger grips may be recessed into the wall of the each finger-receiving channel. Such grips might be injection moulded. Such finger grips might be extended outside any of all of the finger-receiving channels to provide grips to retain wipes. In aspects, such finger grips may partly or wholly replace the need for the use of the yokes, as described hereinafter. With no yokes in place and finger grips in place, a users hand may simply descend vertically onto and pick up the block form body, making it a true “one-hand” pick up. This vertical descent pick up action is typically different from the pick up action where yokes are employed that typically require a two-handed pick up action because the hand to be associated with the block form body must be slid in laterally, under the yokes.In a particular aspect, the block form body is arranged for ambidextrous use. That is to say, it is arranged such that it is readily use-able with either the left or right hand of the user. The benefit of ambidextrous product form is that one product meets all needs, so no need to make a choice at the point of sale. In one form, particularly suitable for ambidextrous use, the block form body has four finger channels, and the two middle channels are produced the same length (i.e. both will accommodate the second longest finger of a user). The two outer finger channels are also produced the same length (i.e. they are both produced long enough to accommodate the index finger of a user). It will be appreciated that in this form, the effect is that, the third and fourth finger channels are longer than need be for both left and right handed users. Additionally, in forms arranged for ambidextrous use both palm support means (e.g. both yokes) are set at the same distance from the palm. Compare this with for example, a ‘right hand only’ product where the right yoke is typically set back a little (closer to the palm).In variations, the one or more walls do not extend sufficiently to provide protection in use, to the user's finger tips. Instead, the base part of the block body of the interface extends forward of the end finger tip position in use, so that the finger tips are “set-back” from harm.In aspects, finger tip grips are provided, possibly injection moulded, to grip the finger tips of a users' finger, in use.The palm support means herein functions to provide extra support to the body (e.g. palm-protecting part) of the interface and to retain it firmly against the underside of the user's hand. In general terms, the purpose of the palm support means is to prevent the body (particularly, the palm piece thereof) drooping down because of its own weight and that of any cleaning media and mopped up liquids thereon. Suitably, the palm support means secures the body of the interface to the base of the fingers and/or the palm of the user's hand. Suitably, the palm support means takes the form of one or more resilient yokes. The yokes are shaped for receipt at the junction between the fingers of a user (i.e. at the junction of either the first and second, second and third, or third and fourth fingers).Suitably, the yokes are shaped to cooperate with the natural taper common to all hands. The resilient nature of the yoke once again affords the device to accommodate and adjust to various hand sizes. Suitably, the one or more yokes have a T-form. In particular, each yoke comprises a vertical trunk with horizontally extended arms and legs. In use, the T-form yoke fits between a user's adjacent fingers. In one aspect, each yoke comprises two pairs of independent arms, each pair mounted on a corresponding vertical trunk. This configuration allows even greater freedom of movement. Suitably, in use with a large hand the vertical trunk of the yoke sits forward of the junction of finger and palm of a large hand, so that in use, the shorter fingers of a smaller hand may reach the end of the finger-receiving channels. In one aspect, the portion of the yoke that is secured to the ‘palm piece’ part of the body is set back, relatively close to the wrist. This is done to provide that the palm piece itself is given its support as central to its weight as is possible, without allowing that these lowest portions of the yokes might be uncomfortable to the small hand when crushing the form so as to wring it out. In one aspect, the yokes are produced as a single-piece having a base plate that connects them. The base plate may then be fixed to the ‘palm piece’ of the body. In one particular aspect, the yokes have snap up-snap down form. This form, typically involved hinged yokes, enables a user's hand to descend vertically onto the block form body for engagement therewith rather than having to be slid into the yokes on the horizontal plane.Suitably, a forward element of the yoke rises vertically from the body (e.g. by about 10 mm) to form one half of a simple hinge. In side elevation, the working part of the yoke now forms a splayed “U” shape, with its cooperating element of the hinge at the bottom of the “U”. The hinged yoke defines two distinct positions. The first is the “at work” or “snap down” position (i.e. viewed in side elevation, the “U” is positioned with one of its arms lying flat on the base of the body and the other resembling a fixed yoke position). The second is the “waiting” or “snap up” position (i.e. the “U” form is pointing upwards). The hand engagement action involves the user's hand descending vertically onto the hinged yoke such that the back most arm of the “U” is pressed down onto the body causing the forward arm of the “U” to close down against the back of the user's hand.Suitably, the form and action of the yokes herein takes advantage of the natural tapering form of the user's hand. In general terms, the side, elevation taper of the user's hand is used to advantage when from its most forward point, the yoke returns back towards the wrist, in a curve that is first low to the palm for tight accommodation of a small, ladies hand's depth at junction of finger and palm, then gradually increases in height as it travels further back so that at its full height it comfortably accommodates a large, male hand's depth at this point. The form of this curve generally accommodates all of the in between hand sizes. The form of this curve may be optimised by study of the form of the skin as it rises between the fingers. It can be seen that, at the junction of two fingers, the skin rises from its extreme forward position at palm level, and travels backwards and upwards in a gentle curve until it reaches and becomes the covering of the back of the hand.Preferably, the interface comprises two or three resilient palm support members (e.g. yokes), each of which may comprise pairs of independent arms.In aspects, the finger-receiving channels and/or palm support means are made from sprung steel wire or moulded (e.g. injection moulded) plastics or skinned foam. In one aspect, the palm support means comprises a resilient framework that is arranged to carry support from the supported finger area to the palm area. Thus, as the forward portion of the body of the interface is supported so accordingly is the palm piece. The framework might be arranged so that it collapses comfortably within the hand when the interface is crushed for wringing out purposes.In another aspect, the palm support means comprises strap (e.g. elasticised) that in use, passes over the back of the user's hand, thereby providing support to the palm of the user. The strap may be a single strap or it may comprise two or more straps arranged for engagement. Thus the and of the straps may be provided with suitable fixing means such as buckles, hook and eye fixings (e.g. Velcro, trade name) or adhesive fixings.In another aspect, the palm support means is provided by providing the palm piece of the body with raised parts at each side that are designed to return in so as to partially close over the back of a received user's hand. An applied strip of resilient material might alternatively provide this returning in action e.g. a plastic material). The material is suitably sprung and formed so that pressure downwards at its centre point, causes the end portions to snap and releasably lock over the back of the hand.In one aspect herein, the body is injection-moulded such that it has a ‘skin’ on part or selected parts of or its entire surface. Such a skin is readily over printed for marketing purposes. In one aspect, the entire body is provided with a skin to enhance its resilience in general terms, and in particular to prevent drooping down of the palm piece. Such a fully skinned embodiment is particularly suitable for use with disposable wipes. By contrast, a no skin version is more suitable for use in applications where water absorption is an important factor. Also envisaged are hybrid forms, where the body starts out fully skinned, but the skin of the base and optionally other non-hand contacting parts is removed to allow it to absorb liquid media. Such an approach may be used to provide a general mop-up product that allows a user's hand to remain dry in its use. In one variation, the base of the body has a skin that acts to provide a waterproof layer and when used in combination with a wipe attachment serves to prevent evaporation of (e.g. cleaning) chemicals from the wipe. A skinned base also provide an ideal surface to carry, for example, a low tack adhesive for temporary securing of a wipe attachment.The use of an injection-moulded form also enables ready chamfering of defined regions or lines on the base (e.g. at the perimeter thereof) for optimal retention of a wipe attachment.With regard to forms of the finger-receiving channels in which the upper portion of the walls is made to close in over the top of the finger, the presence of a skin acts to ease finger access and promote the return back of the form over the top of the finger. This is a particular benefit when it is desired that the hand be simply pressed down onto the interface in order for it to be picked up.In embodiments herein making use of yoke elements, the yokes are suitably produced in the same injection mould process as the body and the strength of the yokes is enhanced by also providing them with a skin.Optionally, the interface is provided with an ancillary interface such as in the form of a flexible backing sheet. This ancillary interface may be shaped and sized such as to enhance the coverage of the user's hand. The ancillary interface may also be provided with attachment means (e.g. in the form of snap-fit contourings) for attachment to the glove. Suitably, the interface additionally comprises means to receive one or more utility attachments. As used herein, the term “utility attachments” refers to attachments having a useful function. For example, the utility attachments may take the form of tools for any useful purpose. Suitable purposes include cleaning, washing and use in household tasks; DIY purposes including sanding, painting, shaping and forming; medical purposes; patient care purposes such as bed bathing; automotive car care including washing, polishing, leathering and interior cleaning; health and beauty purposes such as ex-foliation, massage, application of oils/lotions; gardening purposes such as house plant leaf cleaning/treatment; shoe and boot polishing; window cleaning; grooming of humans and of animals. Indeed, the interface may find utility in pretty much any and every task managed by hand.The utility attachments may either be permanently attached to the interface or reversibly receivable by the interface. For example, the interface and utility attachment may be formed as cooperating elements, the utility attachment being interchangeable and or replaceable. The means to receive utility attachments may comprise one or more circular recesses. These may provide the means to locate cleaning media and provide the home, for example, for bristle bunches. Suitably, the means to receive utility attachments may comprise at least one female socket for receiving a male counterpart situated on a utility attachment. The means to receive utility attachments are typically positioned at the underside of the block form body.In one aspect, the releasable attachment of the utility attachment (e.g. in the form of a cloth wipe) to the body is as follows: The periphery of the cloth wipe (e. g. shaped to cooperate with the body form) is printed with wax, or some other water repellent, to produce a flat non-cloth surface, and the cooperating periphery of the body is printed with “post-it note” (trade mark) type low tack adhesive. Further, the wax printing on the wipe may be arranged to give it a degree of resilience/form-ability. This enables stamp forming of the wipe to give it an up-turned edge, so to reduce the danger of it getting caught and ripped off in use in the work situation. The up-turn is typically no more than 30 degrees, because of the need to stack the wipes. The printing/stamping may in aspects, be combined with the die cutting operation, to make it a one hit process. As an alternative, “paper engineering” may be used as a means of fixing wipe to the body, such as of the type used in disposable nappy fixings. In aspects, the standard wipe fabric can be roughed up on one side to produce attachment loops for attachment to suitable hooks on the periphery of the underside of the body.In aspects, the side wall (i.e. outer wall) of the block form body is provided with means for attachment of the utility attachments. In particular, variations are envisaged wherein such means are provided for attachment of a wipe (e.g. a cloth wipe) to the block form body. Such attachment provides the advantage that in use, wipe covers both the utility surface (e.g. underside) and at least part of the side wall of the block form body.In one particular aspect, one or more attachment features defining attachment target areas are provided to the side wall of the block form body. Suitably, in use the wipe covers the base of the block form body and rises up the side walls thereof to their full height. This provides the advantage that, where the surface to which the hand-utility interface is being applied (e.g. for cleaning thereof) alters through 90 degrees, the margin of both surfaces is cleaned. Suitably, each attachment feature comprises a non-absorbent material having protrusions provided thereto, such that in use the wipe is mechanically (e.g. frictionally) retained by interaction with the protrusions. Suitably, the protrusions take the form of a series of teeth (i.e. not unlike the cutting edge of a saw) or a series of spikes or hooks.In one aspect, the attachment feature takes the form of a continuous strip arranged to run along a substantial part of the side wall of the block form body. Alternatively, plural attachment features (e.g. tab form) are employed, each arranged in series fashion spaced around the wall. Various materials may be used to form the or each attachment feature, but it is important that the material used is relatively thin and that it has a degree of pliability, so that it cannot represent any danger of marking or scratching the surface to which the hand-utility surface is applied (e.g. in a cleaning operation using a wipe). In use, the attachment feature (s) may be arranged such that the teeth-like protrusions are defined at any suitable position relative to the wall, though preferably the teeth present themselves above the upper part (i.e. that part distant from the utility surface) of the side wall. One suitable material for use in construction of the attachment feature (s) is acetate, for example of thickness from 0.1 to 0.2 mm (e. g. 0.13 mm). Acetate provides the advantage that it is impervious to the moisture in the wipe. The protrusions (e.g. teeth) may rise vertically from the attachment feature, or they may be produced at an angle thereto so that they stand proud from the side wall. As a further alternative, static electricity may be employed as a temporary fixing means. As a further alternative, the wipe is printed with a cling-promoting material that causes it to cling to the block form body. The utility attachments may take the form of bristles, spines, hooks, hair, sponge, leather, fabric pads, scourers, abrasives or wire wool.The utility attachments may also comprise vacuum elements. In one vacuum aspect, a resilient ‘fish-tail’ nozzle attaches to the underside of the interface. Leading therefrom a very light weight hose goes back, under the wrist and is supported mid way between wrist and elbow by a loop or hook form which goes over the arm. Suitably, a flexible membrane covers the underside of the body. Further, this flexible membrane extends to provide a “skirt” positioned outside the bristles, running around the outside of the palm and up the outside of the index and little finger, once again preventing loss of suction and promoting that the vacuum is available under the finger tip bristles. The bristle part of this particular tool is in the form of a flexible membrane with bristles lining the side of each finger and surrounding the underside of the glove. The vacuum then draws down the bristle “avenue” underneath each finger, and generally around the palm.In another aspect, the interface incorporates means for using liquids and gasses as “tools”, both flowing out through and being drawn in through attachable media. A reservoir for dispensing such gasses and or liquids may be additionally incorporated as an integral or separate, but connected, feature of the claimed invention.In one embodiment, the utility attachments are permanently attached to the interface. In another embodiment, the utility attachments are removable and/or exchangeable.The utility attachment is particularly suitable for use with wipes (e.g. cloth-form). The wipes may be comprised of any suitable woven or non-woven material of either natural or synthetic origin. The wipes may be used for a variety of purposes including the picking up of detritus (e.g. crumbs) from a kitchen work surface; other household uses including disinfecting, cleaning and polishing; mother and baby hygiene; hospital uses including patient hygiene and pre-operation preparation; veterinary uses including animal care in general; office and other commercial premises cleaning; automotive uses such as cleaning and polishing.Wipes are commonly provided with a chemical formula that rapidly evaporates. In their current form, i.e. in use under the hand, the wipe is free to ‘breath’ from its upper surface; accordingly its life span and performance are needlessly reduced. In aspects, the upper surface of the wipe is provided with a waterproof membrane, so that it can't breath that way, and its in-use lifetime is improved. One approach to achieving this is to give the wipe a fixed membrane. The other approach is to give the hand-utility interface herein, a fixed membrane. The advantage of the latter is that the cost is reduced to one membrane for any number of wipes. However, if both wipe and the hand-utility interface herein had such a membrane, it might be possible to use static electricity as an alternative means of securing wipe to the interface. The wipe used under the hand, is pressed into action only by four narrow lines (the underside of the fingers), and the periphery of the palm, this is inefficient. The wipe applied by means of the hand-utility interface herein is evenly applied over the whole of its surface. Moreover, because of the interface's ability to adapt to irregular surfaces, the performance is greatly enhanced.Current wipes unfold to be bigger than the hand and can dry out long before it is possible, evenly to apply all of its surface to a particular wiping. This is less so for a wipe applied by the interface herein. Current wipes used directly under the hand demand that the user's hands are then washed, not so when the wipes are used with the hand-utility interface herein. The chemicals used in current wipes have to be appropriate for direct, constant contact with the skin, and so are limited in their aggressiveness, not so where the wipes are used with the hand-utility interface herein in that the interface protects the hand from chemical contact. Because of its moisture and rapid evaporation, the current wipe is particularly cold to the touch, less so when the wipe is used with the hand-utility interface herein which is generally dry, and warm because of its foam insulation characteristics. Current wipe forms are typically very thin and give the user's hand little protection from the impact of surfaces encountered, not so when used with the interface herein which provides a very comfortable barrier between the hand and whatever it meets. In particular it provides a buffer for each finger tip, to absorb impact to reduce the discomfort of “stubbing”. By the same means it protects the finger nails.According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a hand-utility interface for use in protecting a user's hand during utility tasks comprising a foamed block body having a plurality of finger-receiving channels defined therein, wherein the finger-receiving channels snugly receive the fingers of said user's hand such that in use, the finger-receiving channels secure, the interface to the user's hand. It will be appreciated that this further aspect of the present invention represents a simplification in that distinct palm support means are not necessarily present. In use, the finger-receiving channels (alone or assisted in some other way) secure the interface to the user's hand. All other aspects of the interface, including variations thereof, are as described previously in respect of the first aspect of the present invention in which distinct palm support means are provided.In one aspect, the body of the hand-utility interface is shaped to cooperate with a base station. Suitably, the base station is in this aspect provided shaped to receive the body such that, when the hand pushes the body into the base station, the interface is received in a ‘parking’ configuration.In one aspect, the base station herein is integral with a container for use in containing suitable wipe attachments (e.g. a tub of wipes). For example, the interface is arranged to mate with a recessed base station within the lid of the container. Further, the container might be designed for wall mounting.Suitably, the container for the wipes is sized and shaped to both contain a stack of wipes and such that the block form body of the may be readily brought into contact with the stack to enable ready attachment of a wipe (generally that located at the top of the stack) thereto. In a preferred usage mode, simple pressure contact of the block form body with the stack of wipes results in co-operative attachment of a wipe thereto. In particular, this pressure contact results in suitable interaction of the wipe with one or more attachment features provided to the side wall (i.e. outer wall) of the block form body for attachment thereto.Suitably, Velcro (trade name) strips are applied to the underside base and side walls of the block form body to assist adherence of a wipe thereto. In one suitable configuration, the Velcro (trade name) strips run vertically up the side walls from the base. The barbs of the Velcro (trade name) may be arranged to be uni-directional (e.g. arranged to point up the side walls of the block form body so that any gravitational pull on the wipe assists to fix that wipe to the block form body. The surface of the wipe may be loose or open or rough to assist the engagement with the barbs. The angles of the barbs may be selected to optimise engagement with the wipe during the engaging movement of the block form body with the wipe. Suitably, the container for the wipes (e.g. in tub form) is sized and shaped such that when wipes are stacked therein a portion (typically, a central portion) of each wipe adopts a flat configuration and another portion (typically, the edge portions) of each wipe adopt a standing configuration (i.e. rising up at an angle to the flat portion). Preferably, each has a bowl-like profile (i.e. flat base and rising up sides) and the wipes stack in a configuration not unlike a stack of cup cake paper containers.Suitably, packaging is provided for separately containing a hand-utility interface and wipes for use therewith. The packaging may comprises a housing arranged to be reversible foldable from an ‘unfolded’ access configuration to a ‘folded’ storage configuration. Suitably, the packaging housing is provided with a first recess sized and shaped to contain a stack of wipes and a second recess sized and shaped to contain a hand-utility interface. Suitably, the wipe-containing recess has a vertical outer wall and a sloping inner wall adjacent to the fold line. The sloping inner wall is shaped to assist dragging of a wipe there over. Suitably, the wipe-containing recess is covered by seal sheet which purpose is to prevent evaporation of the cleaning agent from the contained wipes. Suitably, the seal sheet has one edge permanently fixed to the packaging housing and its other edges reversibly fixed to the packaging housing by re-sealable adhesive means such that when in a sealing configuration the sheet covers the whole recess. Suitably, the interface-containing recess has vertical walls that are roughened or abraded. Suitably, the interface-containing recess is partly of full depth and partly of progressively reducing depth.In alternatives, the wipes may be pre-formed (e.g. moulded) to adopt a suitable profile or the forming may be in situ, that is to say the container itself is used to define the profile thereof. In addition, the wipes may be provided with suitable (eg. “V-shaped”) cut outs around the perimeter thereof to more readily enable the adoption of the desired profile for stacking. In one aspect, edge portions of the wipe (which in the stacked configuration, form the rising up sides) may be loose woven to assist attachment to the attachment features, or indeed the whole wipe might be so woven. In variations, any of the flat and/or rising up portions of the wipe may be provided with markings (e.g. colours, printed graphics or textural) to assist the user in bringing the block form body accurately into pressure contact with the wipe at the top of the stack for picking up thereof. Suitably, each wipe is provided with a tab whose surface is dry (e.g. waxed) and such as to provide a non-cleaning agent impregnated finger hold area to the user for use in pulling a spent wipe from a hand-utility interface.Suitably, the container for the wipes (e.g. in tub form) is arranged such that it presents a resilient surface to the bottom wipe of the stack. Suitably, the surface is of sprung plastic form. More suitably, the surface has the form of a dome in the centre of the base area of the container, which when pressed down causes arm elements which extend from the dome, to press the stack of wipes against the side walls of the block form body so pressing the wipe onto attachment features provided thereto. Suitably, the sprung element co-operates with the walls of the container in order to perform this assisted attachment operation.In another aspect, the invention provides a kit of parts comprising a hand-utility interface as defined supra and a set of utility attachments as defined supra. Optionally, the kit of parts further comprises a base station for said interface.Referring now to the drawings.  illustrates a hand-utility interface herein  herein arranged to mate with a wipe attachment  therefor.The interface  has block form body  injection-moulded from a polymeric foam material.

The tip ends -d of the index, third and fourth fingers of the body  may be seen to define a generally soft, rounded profile whereas that tip end of the second (i.e. longest) finger has a generally, 90*(right angled) profile. This form of profile eases the insertion of the second finger tip end into corners for cleaning such as for example, where the interface is used for window cleaning. The finger tip ends , of the body  for the index and third fingers are suitably arranged to crush down, thereby providing an improved profile for sweeping a window frame immediately adjacent to the glass.The body is further provided with resilient yokes , each comprising a bobbled end , .

The underside base  of the interface  has a uniform flat surface (not visible) that is shaped to receive a utility attachment in the form of a wipe . Suitable means (e.g. as described hereinbefore) may be provided to fix the wipe  to the base of the interface . The wipe  is suitably provided with cleaning media (e.g. detergent).Whilst the body of  is described above as a body  component of the interface of  (which also comprises yoke form palm support means), embodiments are envisaged herein in which no palm support means are present. Such embodiments may be derived from the basic body form shown in  by for example, raising the height of the relevant walls -of the finger-receiving channels -or otherwise modifying such finger-receiving channels in accord with any variations set out in the description herein to provide sufficiently retaining finger support means that no distinct palm support means are required to support the user's hand, in use.illustrates a further hand-utility interface herein  herein arranged to mate with a wipe attachment  therefor. The interface  has block form body  injection-moulded from a polymeric foam material. The body  is shaped to receive in use, the palm and fingers of a user and is provided with a palm-receiving portion  having a gently domed surface to mirror the surface of a received user's palm and four elongate U-shaped finger-receiving channels -. The finger-receiving channels -may be seen to be defined by two outer walls -and three inner dividing waifs -, which stand proud from the base  of the interface . The thickness of the walls -, -is suitably selected to be sufficient such that the interface  deforms relatively little even when pressure is applied by the user's hand. The tip ends -d of the index, third and fourth fingers of the body  may be seen to define a generally soft, rounded profile whereas that tip end of the second (i.e. longest) finger has a generally 90 (right angled) profile. This form of profile eases the insertion of the second finger tip end into corners for cleaning such as for example, where the interface is used for window cleaning. The finger tip ends , of the body  for the index and third fingers are suitably arranged to crush down, thereby providing an improved profile for sweeping a window frame immediately adjacent to the glass.The body is further provided with resilient yokes , each comprising a bobbled end , . In use, the yokes , respectively bridge the node between a user's first and second, and third and fourth fingers, the bobbled end -engaging the top of the user's hand, such that the palm of the user's hand is retained adjacent to the palm-receiving portion  of the body .In a variation of the interface of , the two yokes , are produced as a single-piece moulding having a base plate that connects them. The base plate may then be fixed to the upper surface  of the interface .In use, the finger channels -and the yokes -in combination, form the means to retain the interface on the user's hand. The user inserts a finger into each respective finger-receiving channel -. where each finger is snugly received. The snug receipt is assisted by the resilience of the foam material comprising the body  which mean that the relevant walls -, -of each finger-receiving channel tend to give as a finger is inserted and naturally adapt to any further finger movement to maintain snug finger-receipt. In a usage operation, the user's fingers grip the divider watts -of the finger-receiving channels -, thereby retaining the finger-receiving part of the body  adjacent to the fingers. Meanwhile, the yokes , engage the node between the user's first and second, and third and fourth fingers such as to retain the palm of the user's hand adjacent to the palm-receiving portion  of the body . The independent flexing of each of the finger-receiving channel -and yoke elements -contributes to the ability of the glove to both protect the user's palm and fingers without hampering the movement of the user's hand and fingers.The underside base  of the interface  has a uniform flat surface (not visible) that is shaped to receive a utility attachment in the form of a wipe . Attachment means are provided to fix the wipe  to the interface . In more detail, the attachment means comprise three pairs of attachment tabs -, each comprising non-absorbent material and provided with a toothed upper edge -. Two pairs of tabs -, e-f are arranged on the side walls , of the block form body and the other pair of tabs -arranged at the leading end of the body  on either side of 90 tip end . The wipe  is seen to have a shape defining generally upturned edges . It may be appreciated that the overall wipe  profile is arranged such that when the body  is pressed onto the wipe  the upturned edges  thereof tend to ride up the side walls -and tip end portion of the body to contact the attachment tabs -. Attachment of wipe  to body  occurs when the edges  of the wipe  are retained by the toothed upper edge -of each attachment tab -. In use, the wipe  is suitably provided with cleaning media (e.g. detergent). In one variation of the utility attachment shown in , the wipe  is provided as the leading wipe of a stack of wipes container within a tub-form container. The profile of the tub is further arranged such that when the body  is pressed onto the wipe , the stack is depressed and the sides of the tub act on the wipe  to urge its edges  towards the attachment tabs -on the body.and show packaging  suitable for separately containing a hand-utility interface (not shown) and wipes  for use therewith. The packaging may be configured to accommodate any particular hand-utility interface including one that has ‘ambidextrous’ form (i.e. suitable for wearing on either hand of the user). In more detail, the packaging  comprises a vacuum-formed tray  arranged to be reversible foldable in half about fold line  from an ‘unfolded’ access configuration (as shown) to a ‘folded’ storage configuration. The left-hand (as shown) part of the tray  is provided with a first recess  sized and shaped to contain a stack of wipes  impregnated with cleaning agent. The wipe-containing recess  has a vertical outer wall  (i.e. perpendicular to the plane defined by the tray ) and a sloping inner wall  adjacent to the fold line . The sloping inner wall  is shaped to assist dragging of a wipe  there over. The right-hand (as shown) part of the tray  is provided with a second recess  sized and shaped to contain a hand-utility interface (not shown) herein, which for example, may have a form similar to that shown in .The vertical walls , of the interface-containing recess  are roughened or abraded for a purpose that will described later. The interface-containing recess  is of full depth from that part of the recess extending from where line X-X′ intersects to its forward pointed end but then tapers to progressively lower depth towards its half-moon shaped rear end . This tapering ensures that a user's wrist will not adversely impact on the walls , of the recess  when a user's hand is inserted therein. The wipe-containing recess  is covered by plastic seal sheet  whose purpose is to prevent evaporation of the cleaning agent from the wipes . The sea sheet  has one edge permanently fixed to the left-hand, outer edge  of the tray  and its other edges reversibly fixed to the tray  by re-sealable adhesive trace-line  to such that when in a sealing configuration the sheet  covers the whole recess .The top surface of each wipe  may be seen to the printed with a target area  corresponding to the outer profile of the hand-utility interface (not shown) to which it is to be attached. V-cuts -are provided to each wipe  at first to third angular corners -thereof. The v-cuts -act such as to assist fixing of the wipe  a suitable hand-utility interface by relieving the resistance of the wipe  to becoming fixed thereto, which may otherwise arise due to the need to fold the wipe at its corners -. Each wipe  is also provided with a tab  whose surface is dry (e.g. waxed) and such as to provide a non-cleaning agent impregnated finger hold area to the user for use in pulling a spent wipe  from a hand-utility interface.The packaging  of and is for example, suitable for use with a hand-utility interface of the general form as shown in . In variations, of the interface  of  Velcro (trade name) strips may be applied to the underside base  and side walls -of the interface  to assist adherence of a wipe , thereto. In one configuration, the Velcro (trade name) strips run vertically up the side walls -from the base . The barbs of the Velcro (trade name) may be arranged to be uni-directional (e.g. arranged to point up the side walls -of the interface  so that any gravitational pull on the wipe , assists to fix that wipe , to the interface . The surface of the wipe , may be loose or open or rough to assist the engagement with the barbs. The angles of the barbs may be selected to optimise engagement with the wipe  during the engaging movement of the interface with the wipe .In a typical usage operation of the packaging of and , the pack  is unfolded about fold line  from its storage configuration to its access configuration. The user applies the interface (not shown) stowed in recess  to their hand such that the interface is worn by the user's hand. The interface is then removed from the recess  under the control of the user's hand by lifting or sliding it out of the recess . Seal sheet  is then peeled away to uncover the stack of wipes . The underside of the interface is then applied with light pressure to the target area  of the top wipe  of the stack causing the wipe  to lightly adhere to the interface. That wipe  is then dragged over incline  from the wipe-containing recess  to the second recess . Greater downward pressure is then applied by the user's hand to the interface and wipe  within the recess  resulting in firm adherence of the wipe  to interface. The tapered nature of the recess  ensures that the user's wrist will not adversely interact with the walls , of the recess  during this pressing down action. The roughened or abraded nature of the vertical walls , of the recess  assist in fixing the wipe  to the interface (e.g. by assisting to drive the barbs of a Velcro (trade name) strip into the wipe ). Typically, the edges  of the wipe  will ride up the side walls (e.g. side walls -of ) of the interface and be gripped by grip features (e.g. attachment tabs -of ) of the interface. Cleaning operations may then be performed with the firmly-adhered wipe , which is removed after use by the taking grip of the spent wipe by dry tab  and ripping it from the interface.and show sectional views of a hinged yoke for use with the interface herein in respective ‘lockdown’ and ‘lockup’ positions. Base  of first part  of hinged yoke  seats on block form body .Rising mast  of the first yoke part  projects away from the block form body  to hinge point  at which second “U” shaped part  of the hinged yoke  hingedly connects thereto. It may be seen that the hinged yoke  defines two distinct positions. The first shown in is the “at work” or “snap down” position (i.e. viewed in side elevation, the “U” shaped part  is positioned with one of its arms lying flat on the base of the body and the other resembling a fixed yoke position). The second shown in is the “waiting” or “snap up” position (i.e. the “U” shaped part  is pointing upwards). Engagement of the user's hand with the hinged yoke  involves a user's hand descending vertically onto the hinged yoke  when in the “waiting” or “snap up” position such that the back most arm of the “U” part  is pressed down onto the body  causing the forward arm of the “U” part  to close down against the back of the user's hand.shows a view of a block form body  provided with finger grips , in the ‘grips open’ position. shows a top view of a detail of the block form body  of with the finger grips , in the ‘grips closed’ position.

Each finger grip , fits within a recess , provided to the base , and relevant walls , -of each finger-receiving channel , . In use, the finger grips , function to grip the relevant finger of a user's hand, thereby securing the fingers (and hand) to the block form body . With finger grips , in place, a user's hand may simply descend vertically onto and pick up the block form body , making it a true “one-hand” pick up.shows a top view of a block form body  suitable for ambidextrous use herein with a crushable band  provided at the finger tip region.

It may be noted that the block  has generally symmetric form such that first and fourth finger-receiving channels mirror each other in form as do the second and third finger-receiving channels. This is deliberate since it is intended that the block form body  may form part of an interface to be worn on either hand of the user. The applicant has however, noted that there can be a problem with such a symmetric (i.e. ambidextrous) form of the block form body. In use, neither the third or fourth fingers of the user fully reach the end of their respective finger-receiving channels, for either the left or the right hand. In effect, the vacant space in the relevant finger-receiving channel moves from the right hand side of the block form body to the left hand side, depending upon which hand is applied. The block form body  of  is thus provided with a crushable band  extending across the tips of each finger-receiving channel -. The band  is resiliently crushable in form, for example comprising a soft-walled fluid-filled sack. In use, when a user's fingers are inserted into the finger-receiving channels -the band  crushes, thereby resulting in filling up of the otherwise vacant channel -space by the band .In another aspect herein, the hand-utility interface is suitable for use with a self-disinfecting cloth or cloth with visual warning feature to show when disinfectant components thereof are exhausted. The cloth might be a permanent fixture attached to the interface, or it might be a separate and replaceable feature. In either case, the interface will typically be provided vertical apertures in the finger channels and in the ‘palm piece’ part of the body, through which the “pockets” of disinfectant will be clearly visible before the hand is inserted.According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a multi-layer form cleaning cloth comprising (a) an absorbent cloth layer; (b) adjacent to said absorbent cloth layer, a perforate layer comprising at least partly nontransparent material; and (c) adjacent to said perforate layer, a fluid impermeable layer comprising at least partly a transparent material, said fluid impermeable layer joining to said perforate layer such that a reservoir for receipt of cleaning media is defined, wherein the non-transparent perforate layer is visible through the transparent liquid impermeable layer when the reservoir is empty of cleaning media. The cleaning cloth herein has a multi-layer form. That is to say, it comprises multiple layers of material, the characteristics of which in combination define the functionality of the cleaning cloth. The cleaning cloth comprises an absorbent cloth layer. The cloth layer may comprise either woven or non-woven cloth material of either synthetic or natural origin. The cloth layer acts as the ‘business end’ of the cleaning cloth herein. That is to say, it is the part of the cloth that is directly used to contact surfaces to be cleaned when employed in cleaning operations herein. Adjacent to the absorbent cloth layer, there is provided a perforate (or part-fluid permeable) layer. The perforate layer may be in the form of a membrane. Suitably the perforate layer permits only one-way passage. of cleaning media. That is to say, it permits passage of cleaning media from the reservoir to the absorbent cloth but not in the reverse direction. The perforate layer is typically in joined or at least, in contacting relationship with the absorbent cloth. The perforate layer comprises at least partly non-transparent material. In one aspect, the perforate layer comprises coloured material. In another aspect, the perforate layer comprises visible markings such as defined indicia (e.g. words or symbols or a repeating pattern thereof).Adjacent to the perforate layer, there is provided a fluid impermeable layer. The fluid impermeable layer comprises at least partly a transparent material (e.g. formed of clear polythene). The fluid impermeable layer joins to the perforate layer such that a reservoir (e.g.' pocket) for receipt of cleaning media is defined therebetween. in use, the reservoir is provided with cleaning media (e.g. detergent or disinfectant), generally in fluid, gel or water-soluble solid form. The cleaning media is visible to the user through the transparent part of the fluid impermeable layer. In aspects, the cleaning media is coloured such as to enhance its visibility in the reservoir.In one aspect, the cleaning media is over-printed onto the perforate layer such as in a layer of about 1 mm thick. The fluid impermeable layer is then applied over this printed layer and edge-seals formed to provide a sealed reservoir volume. In accord with the invention however, such cleaning media blocks or otherwise compromises the user's view of the non-transparent perforate layer. The non-transparent perforate layer is visible through the transparent liquid impermeable layer only when the reservoir is essentially empty of (i.e. depleted of) cleaning media. In use, the cleaning cloth is designed such that cleaning media gradually travels (e.g. as a result of applied pressure or osmosis) from the reservoir through the perforate layer to the absorbent layer where it is used for cleaning purposes. The reservoir therefore becomes progressively depleted of cleaning media until such a point as it is empty, or at least essentially empty for all practical purposes. It is at this point, that the non-transparent perforate layer becomes visible to the user, thereby providing an alert that the cleaning media reservoir has become depleted.In one particular aspect herein, a layer of domestic or other cleaning cloth, has welded to it a repeating pattern of small circles (or other shapes) so that the circles are evenly spaced east/west and north/south on the cloth. The circles are formed of a very thin layer polythene or other impervious but highly flexible material. These circular membranes are arranged to show a colour, most likely red. These circles of red membrane have one or more perforations. By a further process, the circles are “over printed” with a semi solid or gel type disinfectant. This disinfectant layer might typically be 1.00 mm thick. The disinfectant is water-soluble and it is coloured, perhaps yellow. By a further process a transparent waterproof membrane is applied to cover all of the circles and the whole of this side of the cloth. This sheet membrane is welded to both the cloth, between the circles, and to the perimeter only of each circle, so that the disinfectant is contained within cells or pockets. With the cloth dampened, and flexed in work, moisture will pass through the perforations in the red circular membranes and dissolve a portion of the semi-solid disinfectant, with further flexing the now liquid portion of the disinfectant will leak into the fabric of the cloth, so maintaining it safe and hygienic. Gradually, through work, the cells will empty until there is no yellow disinfectant left. So, at this point, when the cloth has reached the end of its hygienic life, a colour change will be apparent to the user, where before the cloth had yellow circles, it now has red circles warning of its imminent descent into an unhygienic state. The cleaning cloth aspect herein is suitable for use with any hand-utility interface including the interface having the foamed block form body, as described hereinbefore. Where the interface comprises a block form body one or more apertures are suitably provided to that body to enable the transparent ‘viewing window’ to be made visible to the user. The cleaning cloth is also suitable for use with the hand-utility interface described in applicant's co-pending PCT patent application no. WO 02/087406.illustrates a cleaning cloth  herein. The cloth comprises a bottom sheet  in the form of an absorbent cloth layer (e.g. formed from a suitable woven or non-woven material). Adjacent to the absorbent cloth layer , there is provided a perforate layer  comprising coloured (e.g. red) material. In aspects, the perforate layer  may be provided with suitable markings (e.g. indicia of any suitable form). Adjacent to the perforate layer, there is provided a top sheet  in the form of a fluid impermeable layer comprising a transparent material.The fluid impermeable layer  joins to said the perforate layer  and absorbent cloth layer  at respective joins  and . A reservoir  for receipt of cleaning media is defined between the fluid impermeable layer  and the perforate layer . The reservoir  is provided with coloured (e.g. green) liquid detergent . When the reservoir  is full, the detergent  content thereof is visible to the user through the transparent liquid impermeable layer . The coloured perforate layer  is however, at least partly obscured from view by the presence of the detergent. In use, however as detergent  is supplied to the absorbent cloth  through the perforate layer the amount of obscuring detergent  in the reservoir is reduced. When the reservoir  is empty of detergent, the coloured perforate layer  becomes clearly visible through the transparent liquid impermeable layer  and this acts as a signal to the user that the reservoir  is empty and therefore that another cleaning cloth  must be selected to continue with the cleaning operation.illustrates a top view of a second cleaning cloth  herein that is shaped for particular use with the hand-cloth interface of -. The liquid impermeable, transparent top sheet  of the cloth  is shaped to mirror that of the underside of the body  of the interface (e.g. as shown in ) to which it is applied in mating contact. Plural reservoirs -are provided to the cloth  and visible through top sheet . Reservoirs -correspond to finger contact locations and reservoir to a palm location. The overall layer structure of the cleaning cloth  corresponds closely to that of . As shown, the cloth  of  is partly depleted of cleaning media. Detergent  is visible in the palm reservoir , but the indicia ′EMPTY'which is printed on the perforate layer  is visible in the finger reservoirs -thereby serving to indicate that these reservoirs have been emptied of detergent and that another cloth  should be selected.-illustrate a hand-cloth interface  suitable for use with the cleaning cloth herein and illustrates palm support means , suitable for use with the hand-cloth interface of -. Each finger portion -of the hand-cloth interface  is provided with a finger grip -in the form of a cage, which surrounds the and of a user's finger and each of which is provided with a thimble-like end -. Each finger -of the hand-cloth interface  is also provided with an inwardly tapering constriction -located at a point below the foremost portion of the finger tip cage -, which in use, corresponds approximately to a point below the first joint of the user's finger. The gripping portion of the finger tip cage -(i.e. that which acts on the constriction -) is that part interior to the lug , as shown in . The gripping point will differ for different user hand sizes. On a small hand, the constriction -locates more or less central to the first and second finger joints; on a large hand the constriction -locates just behind the first finger joint. It may be appreciated that in use, both the finger grip framework -and the constriction -act such as to retain the user's finger within the hand-cloth interface.The hand-cloth interface  is also provided with T-form yokes , each comprising pairs of gripping arms , and , (shown in outline in ). The form of the T-form yokes , may be better understood by reference to from which it may be appreciated that each gripping arm -is independently movable.Indeed, each yoke , is comprised of two separate arm , and , ; trunk , and , ; and base , and , elements. In use, the T-forms yokes , respectively engage the node between a user's first and second, and third and fourth fingers. In tandem, the finger grips -and T-form yokes , form the means to retain the hand-cloth interface on the user's hand. The independent movability of each of these elements, in turn contributes to the ability of the hand-cloth interface to both protect the user's palm and fingers without hampering the movement of the user's hand and fingers.The underside base  of the hand-cloth interface  is formed from a flexible, but resilient material (e.g. foam). The base  is provided with various shape characteristics to maximise its flexibility. These comprise longitudinal cutaway portions  (one only labelled, for clarity) in the palm of base ; diamond-shaped extensible portions  (again, one only labelled) at the palm-end of each finger portion -, which provide flexibility in accommodating an unusually long user's finger; and “v”-shaped incisions  (one labelled only) running transversely across the underside of each finger portion -of the hand-cloth interface , which enables ready finger movement. In the at rest mode, the base  of the hand-cloth interface  has a uniform flat profile and is therefore ideally shaped to receive a cleaning cloth as described herein. The base  is further provided with wall , which assists the stability of the interface  on the user's hand when in use. Each finger grip -is further provided with substantially triangular-shaped lug  (one only shown, for clarity) for use in mounting the hand-cloth interface  to a base station or housing. In use, base  of the hand-cloth interface  is designed to cover at least that part of a user's palm that can be comfortably reached by the user's fingers once they are curled over. This ensures that an attached cleaning cloth can be efficiently wrung out by a simple clenching of the user's fist.In still further aspects herein there is provided a ‘free breathing glove’. This is a full glove that is typically water proof and/or chemical proof and supported on the hand by an interface comprising finger tip grips and yokes. The advantage is that the upper skin of the glove need not touch the hand at all, and so a clear air passage can be provided to allow the hand to breath. In developments of the ‘free breathing glove’ a natural bellows effect can be set up, so that articulation of the hand in work will automatically exchange the air thereby functioning as an ‘excess heat dissipater’.In still further aspects, the interface is provided with a ‘sure grip’ feature. This enables the interface to function as a means of giving an operative a better grip on tools and the materials of work in general. This application can be provided in two forms: one is the format of the interface worn regularly as a glove type. The second is the interface being built into work tools, both powered and non-powered.In still further aspects, the interface is provided as a means of isolating the hand from the vibration of equipment in general. In a particular aspect, the interface is provided as a means of easing the pressures that contribute to repetitive stress injury (RSI). In still further aspects, the interface is used to provide a perfect framework for the hand application of abrasive papers and such as the “Scotch Bright” (trade mark) type format. These abrasives may for example be used for the automotive, aircraft, carpentry and DIY sectorsIn particularly preferred further embodiments of the invention, the body may comprise at least two finger-channels of equal length for receipt of the second and third fingers of the user's hand. Suitably, these two finger channels have identical shape, form and/or dimension. By defining the two finger channels to have identical length in this way (which is different from a conventional glove, in which the second and third fingers of the glove would be of different length) the hand-utility interface is made suitable for ambidextrous use (i.e. it hand be worn on either the left or right hand). The two finger channels may also be arranged to be a mirror image, one of the other.Suitably, the finger-receiving channels are arranged in fanned out configuration. That is to say the channels fan out towards the finger tip end, thereby mirroring the natural fanned out configuration of the fingers of a user's hand.Suitably, each finger-receiving channel narrows progressively along its length. It will be appreciated that the narrowing is towards the finger tip end of each channel. Such narrowing has been found to assist in retaining a user's fingers and hence in use, in retaining the interface to a user's hand. Suitably, the height of each finger-receiving channel reduces progressively along its length. Suitably, the width of each finger-receiving channel reduces progressively along its length. Suitably, the cross-section of each finger-receiving channel reduces progressively along its length.Suitably, the depth of each finger-receiving channel is greater than that of the user's finger. Accordingly, in use the foam walls defining each finger-receiving channel surround the full height of a user's finger. Suitably, the foam above each received finger of the user partially overlaps the upper surface of that received finger. Again, this better assists finger retention.Suitably, each finger-receiving channel has a curving under profile. Preferably, that curving under profile is such as to match the curved under profile of a user's finger when at rest (i.e. when in an untensed state). The finger-receiving channel may also be provided with a curving top line profile and/or and angled under profile.Suitably, the foamed block body is provided with a first cutaway portion arranged in use, for accommodation, but not snug receipt, of the user's thumb. Suitably, the foamed block body is provided with a second cutaway portion arranged in use, for accommodation, but not snug receipt, of the user's little finger.In one aspect, the foamed block body has three finger-receiving channels for receipt of the user's index, second and third fingers respectively, but no finger-receiving channel for receipt of the user's little finger.Suitably, the foamed block body is provided with v-shaped channels for added flexibility.In one aspect, the finger-receiving channels are defined by continuous walls of the foamed block body. In another aspect, the finger-receiving channels are defined by intermittent walls of the foamed block body.Suitably, the foamed block body is provided with a palm-receiving portion shaped to receive a user's palm. Suitably, the palm-receiving portion has a domed profile.Suitably, one or more of the finger-receiving channels is provided with a partial over finger tip cover. Suitably, one or more of the finger-receiving channels is provided with overhanging elements.Suitably, the finger-receiving channels are defined in part by inner dividing walls having a height that increases from the finger tip end to the palm-receiving end of the body to define a yoked projection, which acts such as to retain the upper part of the user's hand to the body.Suitably, divides are provided in the body running between neighbouring finger-receiving channels.In one aspect, the body further comprises palm support means for securing said interface to the palm of a user's hand such that in use, both the palm support means and finger-receiving channels together secure the interface to the user's hand. In another aspect, the body comprises no palm support means for securing said interface to the palm of a user's hand such that in use, only the finger-receiving channels secure the interface to the user's hand.Suitably, to assist snug finger-receipt, each finger-receiving channel is shaped such that it narrows towards the fingertip end. Suitably, to assist snug finger-receipt, each finger-receiving channel is shaped such that the channel narrows (e.g. tapers inwardly) on moving towards the bottom surface of the channel (i.e. towards that surface found closest to the base of the body and deepest within the channel). This narrowing of finger-receiving channel is suitably achieved by inwardly tapering the profile of the walls that define each finger-receiving channel. Suitably, to assist snug finger-receipt, each finger-receiving channel is shaped such as to define a part-circular inner cross-sectional profile.Suitably, the depth of each finger-receiving channel is selected such that on receipt of a user's finger therein the walls defining the channel extend at least 0.6 mm, preferably at least 0.8 mm above the top of the user's finger.Suitably, the finger-receiving channels are too narrow towards their bottom surface to accommodate the fingers of a user without compression of the walls that define each channel. Such compression is readily enabled by forming the walls of a foam that readily gives but also has a memory (i.e. is resilient) such that it returns to its original form on withdrawal of the user's finger. Overall, the desired effect is that the foam above the top of each user's finger tends to regain its memory position, partially closing over the finger, so acting to secure the body to the user's hand. When the foamed body is loaded with liquid, the liquid tends to promote this retention, by serving to resist its being crushed. Where the foam is forced to give (i.e. by the finger's presence within the channel) it does so, causing the displaced liquid to flood the adjacent “partial cells” of the foamed body and walls, including those above the finger line.Suitably, to assist snug finger-receipt, each finger-receiving channel is shaped such that its bottom surface has a curved profile that mirrors that curved profile of the underside of the relevant user's finger in an outstretched but untensed configuration.In the previously described aspects of the present invention, the means for securing the interface to a user's hand comprise palm support means for securing said interface to the palm of a user's hand and the finger-receiving channels for snugly receiving the fingers of the user's hand. In use, the palm support means and finger-receiving channels act in combination to better secure the interface to the user's hand. In another particular aspect, the means for securing the interface to a user's hand comprise only the finger-receiving channels for snugly receiving the fingers of the user's hand. In use, the finger-receiving channels act to secure the interface to the user's hand.In one aspect, the body is provided with four finger-receiving channels. In another aspect, the body is provided with three finger-receiving channels arranged for receipt of the index, second and third fingers of a user's hand. In one three finger-receiving channel embodiment, the body is also provided (adjacent to the first and third finger-receiving channels) with two cut-away portions arranged in use, for accommodation, but not retained receipt, of the user's thumb and little finger. In another three finger-receiving channel embodiment, the foamed body is also provided (adjacent to the first and third finger-receiving channels) with two cut-out portions arranged in use to provide space for the user's thumb and little finger. The three finger-channel (and optionally two cut-away or cut-out portion) form of the interface provides ambidextrous utility. That is to say, it is readily receivable by either hand of the user.The above latter aspects of the present invention, including detailed embodiments where the interface has no palm supports, will now be described further with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:—FIG.

B.Referring now to those drawings, FIG. B illustrates a hand-utility interface herein  herein having a block form body  comprised of a polymeric foam (e.g. open cell) material. The body  is shaped to receive in use, the palm and fingers of a user and is provided with a palm-receiving portion  having a gently domed surface to mirror the surface of a received user's palm and four elongate U-shaped finger-receiving channels -. The finger-receiving channels -may be seen to be defined by two outer walls -and three inner dividing walls -, which stand proud from the base  of the interface . It may be noted that the finger-receiving channels -fan out (i.e. diverge) towards the finger tips. This is in part enabled by the fact that the thickness of the inner dividing walls -increases on proceeding from palm to finger tip end. As with all embodiments, the finger-receiving channels -are provided in the first major face of the body  (which will primarily be the upper face of the body  in most orientations of use) and the channels allow the users fingers to be lowered into the plane of the body  to enter the channels -thereby (as opposed to inserting end-on into the fingers of a glove or mitt).The tip ends -d of the index, third and fourth fingers of the body  may be seen to define a generally soft, rounded profile whereas that tip end of the second (i.e. longest) finger has a generally 90 (right angled) profile. This form of profile eases the insertion of the second finger tip end into corners for cleaning such as for example, where the interface is used for window cleaning. The finger tip ends , of the body  for the index and third fingers are suitably arranged to crush down, thereby providing an improved profile for sweeping a window frame immediately adjacent to the glass.In use, the finger channels -provide the means to retain the interface on the user's hand. The user inserts a finger into each respective finger-receiving channel -where each finger is snugly received. The snug receipt is assisted by the resilience of the foam material comprising the body  which mean that the relevant walls -, -of each finger-receiving channel tend to give as a finger is inserted and naturally adapt to any further finger movement to maintain snug finger-receipt. In a usage operation, the user's fingers grip the divider walls -of the finger-receiving channels -, thereby retaining the finger-receiving part of the body  adjacent to the fingers. The independent flexing of each of the finger-receiving channels -contributes to the ability of the glove to both protect the user's palm and fingers without hampering the movement of the user's hand and fingers. The underside base  of the interface  has a uniform flat surface (not visible) that is shaped to receive utility attachments or media (e.g. cleaning media).FIGS. B to B illustrate aspects of a second hand-utility interface herein  herein that may be appreciated to be a variation of the hand-utility interface of FIG. B. The interface  has a block form body  comprised of a polymeric foam material (e.g. open cell foam). The body  is shaped to receive in use, the palm and fingers of a user and is provided with a palm-receiving portion  shaped to receive a user's palm and four elongate U-shaped finger-receiving channels -. The finger-receiving channels -may be seen to be defined by two outer walls -and three inner dividing walls -, which stand proud from the base  of the interface . It may be noted that the finger-receiving channels -both fan out (i.e. diverge) and narrow towards the finger tips. This is in part enabled by the fact that the thickness of the inner dividing walls -increases on proceeding from palm to finger tip end. The tip end  of the body  has a generally 90 (right angled) profile. This form of profile eases the insertion of the tip end  into corners for cleaning.In use, the finger channels -provide the means to retain the interface on the user's hand. The user inserts a finger into each respective finger-receiving channel -where each finger is snugly received. The snug receipt is assisted by the resilience of the foam material comprising the body  which mean that the relevant walls -, -of each finger-receiving channel tend to give as a finger is inserted and naturally adapt to any further finger movement to maintain snug finger-receipt. In a variation, the walls -, -of one or more of the finger-receiving channels -are shaped further to define a part-circular profile mirroring the dashed circular lines of .To assist snug finger-receipt, as may be seen in FIG. B, each finger-receiving channel -is shaped such that it narrows towards the finger tip end. The width of each channel -close to the finger tip is in particular, less than would be the width of the average user's finger. Insertion of the user's finger therefore results in give of the foamed material forming the walls -, -, which thereby grip the fingers to cause the retention of each user's finger in each finger-receiving channel -. To further assist snug finger-receipt, as may be seen in FIG. B, each finger-receiving channel -is also shaped such that it narrows towards its bottom -(i.e. each gets narrower deeper into the channel -). The width of each channel -close to the finger channel bottom -(i.e. deepest part of the channel) is in particular, less than would be the width of the average user's finger. Insertion of the user's finger deep into each channel therefore results in give of the foamed material forming the walls -, -, which thereby grip the fingers to again cause the retention of each user's finger in each finger-receiving channel -. As shown by the dotted circles visible in FIG. B, the received position of the user's fingers lies somewhat below (e.g. 6-8 mm below) the top surface of the body .To further assist snug finger-receipt, as may be seen in FIG. B, each finger-receiving channel -is also shaped such that its bottom has a curved profile that mirrors that curved profile of the underside of a user's finger in an outstretched but untensed configuration. Such shaping of each finger-channel bottom ensures maximum contact in use, between the underside of the user's finger and the finger-channel bottom , which again enhances the retention of each user's finger in each finger-receiving channel -In a typical usage operation, the user's fingers grip the divider walls -of the finger-receiving channels -, thereby retaining the finger-receiving part of the body  adjacent to the fingers. The independent flexing of each of the finger-receiving channels -contributes to the ability of the glove to both protect the user's palm and fingers without hampering the movement of the user's hand and fingers. The underside base  of the interface  has a uniform flat surface (not visible) that is shaped to receive utility attachments or media (e.g. cleaning media).FIG. B illustrates aspects of a further hand-utility interface herein  herein that may be appreciated to be a variation of the hand-utility interface of FIGS. B to . The interface  has a body  comprised of a polymeric foam material (e.g. open cell foam). The body  is shaped to receive in use, the palm and fingers of a user and is provided with a palm-receiving portion  shaped to receive a user's palm and three elongate U-shaped finger-receiving channels -arranged for receipt of the index, second and third fingers of a user's hand. The finger-receiving channels -may be seen to be defined by two outer walls -and two inner dividing walls -, which stand proud from the base of the interface . It may be noted that the finger-receiving channels -both fan out (i.e. diverge) and narrow towards the finger tips. This is in part enabled by the fact that the thickness of the inner dividing walls -increases on proceeding from palm to finger tip end. The tip and  of the body  has a generally 90 (right angled) profile. This form of profile eases the insertion of the tip end  into corners for cleaning. The interface may also be seen to comprise two cut-away portions -arranged in use, for accommodation, but not retained receipt, of the user's thumb and little finger.The three finger-channel -and two cut-away portion -form of the interface  provides ambidextrous utility. That is to say, it is readily receivable by either hand of the user. In use, the finger channels -provide the means to retain the interface on the user's hand. The user inserts the index, second and third fingers into each respective finger-receiving channel -where the respective finger is snugly received. The snug receipt is assisted by the resilience of the foam material comprising the body  which mean that the relevant walls -, -of each finger-receiving channel tend to give as a finger is inserted and naturally adapt to any further finger movement to maintain snug finger-receipt. In common with the embodiment shown in FIGS. B and B and as described in detail in respect thereof, to assist snug finger-receipt: (i) each finger-receiving channel -is shaped such that it narrows towards the finger tip end; (ii) each finger-receiving channel -is also shaped such that it narrows towards its bottom; and (iii) each finger-receiving channel -is also shaped such that its bottom has a curved profile that mirrors that curved profile of the underside of a user's finger in an outstretched but untensed configuration. In a typical usage operation, the user's inserted fingers grip the divider walls -of the finger-receiving channels -, thereby retaining the finger-receiving part of the body  adjacent to the fingers. The independent flexing of each of the finger-receiving channels -contributes to the ability of the glove to both protect the user's palm and fingers without hampering the movement of the user's hand and fingers. The underside base of the interface  again has a uniform flat surface (not visible) that is shaped to receive utility attachments or media (e.g. cleaning media).FIG. B illustrate aspects of a yet further hand-utility interface herein  herein that may be appreciated to be another variation of the hand-utility interface of FIGS. B to B. The interface  has a block form body  comprised of a polymeric foam material (e.g. open cell foam). The body  is shaped to receive in use, the palm and fingers of a user and is provided with a palm-receiving portion  shaped to receive a user's palm and three elongate U-shaped finger-receiving channels -arranged for receipt of the index, second and third fingers of a user's hand. The finger-receiving channels -may be seen to be defined by two outer walls -and two inner dividing walls -, which stand proud from the base of the interface . It may be noted that the finger-receiving channels -both fan out (i.e. diverge) and narrow towards the finger tips. This is in part enabled by the fact that the thickness of the inner dividing walls -increases on proceeding from palm to finger tip end. The tip end  of the body  has a generally 90 (right angled) profile. This form of profile eases the insertion of the tip end  into corners for cleaning. The interface may also be seen to comprise two cut-out portions -arranged in use, for accommodation, but not gripped receipt, of the user's thumb and little finger. The three finger-channel -and two cut-out portion -form of the interface  provides ambidextrous utility. That is to say, it is readily receivable by either hand of the user. In use, the finger channels -form the means to retain the interface on the users hand. The user inserts the index, second and third fingers into each respective finger-receiving channel -where the respective finger is snugly received.The snug receipt is assisted by the resilience of the foam material comprising the body  which mean that the relevant walls -, -of each finger-receiving channel tend to give as a finger is inserted and naturally adapt to any further finger movement to maintain snug finger-receipt. In common with the embodiment shown in FIGS. B and  and as described in detail in respect thereof, to assist snug finger-receipt: (i) each finger-receiving channel -is shaped such that it narrows towards the finger tip end; (ii) each finger-receiving channel -is also shaped such that it narrows towards its bottom; and (iii) each finger-receiving channel -is also shaped such that its bottom has a curved profile that mirrors that curved profile of the underside of a user's finger in an outstretched but untensed configuration.In a typical usage operation, the user's inserted fingers grip the divider walls -of the finger-receiving channels -, thereby retaining the finger-receiving part of the body  adjacent to the fingers. The independent flexing of each of the finger-receiving channels -contributes to the ability of the interface to both protect the user's palm and fingers without hampering the movement of the user's hand and fingers. The underside base of the interface  has a uniform flat surface (not visible) that is shaped to receive utility attachments or media (e.g. cleaning media).In aspects, the embodiments shown in FIGS. B and B are particularly suitable for use in baby bathing applications, wherein the foamed body comprises a soft, open cell foam body and the ability of the user's index finger and/or thumb to protrude from the body assists with holding/support of the baby that is being bathed.FIGS. B to B illustrate aspects of a yet further hand-utility interface  herein. The interface  has a body  comprised of a polymeric foam material (e. g. closed cell foam). The body  is shaped to receive in use, the palm and fingers of a user and is provided with a slightly raised palm-receiving portion  shaped to snugly receive the underside of a user's palm and four elongate U-shaped finger-receiving channels -. The finger-receiving channels -may be seen to be defined by two outer walls -and three inner dividing walls -, which stand proud from the base  of the interface . The finger tip ends -of the finger-receiving channels -have a round ‘capped’ outer profile to provide protection in use, for the user's finger tips.In use, the finger channels -provide the means to retain the interface on the user's hand. The user inserts a finger into each respective finger-receiving channel -where each finger is snugly received. The snug receipt is assisted by the resilience of the foam material comprising the body  which mean that the relevant walls -, -of each finger-receiving channel tend to give slightly as a finger is inserted and naturally adapt to any further finger movement to maintain snug finger-receipt.To assist snug finger-receipt, the finger-receiving channels -, as defined by the two outer walls -and three inner dividing walls -, are provided with certain features as now described in detail. Firstly, overhangs  -; -are provided to the relevant walls -; -as shown, wherein each overhang  -; -is positioned in use, to contact that part of the upper surface of each user's finger (not shown) that is found beyond the knuckle. It may therefore be appreciated that in use, the overhangs  -; -act such as to prevent the user's finger's from ‘falling out’ of the finger-receiving channels -. Secondly, the capped finger ends -of each finger-receiving channel -defines a finger tip-receiving cavity -for snug receipt of each relevant finger tip of the user. Thirdly, each of the inner dividing walls -may be seen in  to have a height that increases slightly from the finger tip end to the palm-receiving end of the body , at which point a ‘yoke like’ projection -is provided. In use, each yoke-like projection -acts such as to retain the upper part of the user's hand to the body . It is desirable that the body  is able to flex somewhat in use. To enhance flexibility, the three inner dividing walls -, are provided with a further feature as now described in detail. Each of the three inner dividing walls -is provided along its length with a cleft defining an ‘open valley’ feature -, which as may be best seen in , has a depth extending close to the base  of the body . Each open valley -may be seen to extend right up to the finger tip end of the body . The presence of these ‘open valley’ features means that the body  can more readily flex to meet the contours of a surface to be cleaned regardless of relationship of that surface to the base  of the body .In a typical usage operation, the user's fingers grip the divider walls -of the finger-receiving channels -, thereby retaining the finger-receiving part of the body  adjacent to the fingers. The independent flexing of each of the finger-receiving channels -contributes to the ability of the glove to both protect the user's palm and fingers without hampering the movement of the user's hand and fingers. The underside base  of the interface  has a uniform flat surface (not visible) that is shaped to receive utility attachments or media (e.g. cleaning media).FIGS. B to B illustrate aspects of a yet further hand-utility interface  herein. The interface  has a body  comprised of a polymeric foam material (e.g. open cell foam). The underside of the body is provided with an abrasive pad  of the type that is well known for use in kitchen ‘scouring’ operations. The body  is shaped to receive in use, the fingers of a user (not shown) and is provided with three elongate U-shaped finger-receiving channels -arranged for receipt of the index, second and third fingers of a user's hand. The finger-receiving channels -may be seen to be defined by two outer walls -and two inner dividing walls -, which stand proud from the base of the interface . It may be noted that the finger-receiving channels -narrow slightly towards the finger tips. This is in part enabled by the fact that the thickness of the inner dividing walls -increases slightly on proceeding to the finger tip end. In one variation, the finger-receiving channels may also be arranged to fan out (i.e. diverge) as for example, shown at  in relation to the fourth hand-utility interface  herein. The body  may also be seen to be provided with two cut-out portions -arranged in use, for accommodation, but not gripped receipt, of the user's thumb and little finger. The tip end  of the body  has a square cut profile. Overall, it may be appreciated the form of the body  is generally that of a ‘rectangular block’, to which cut-away portions have been provided (e.g. by deformation cutting). The three finger-channel -and two cut-out portion -form of the interface  provides ambidextrous utility. That is to say, it is readily receivable by the fingers of either hand of the user.In use, the finger channels -provide the means to retain the interface on the user's hand. The user inserts the index, second and third fingers into each respective finger-receiving channel -where the respective finger is snugly received. The snug receipt is assisted by the resilience of the foam material comprising the body  which mean that the relevant walls -, -of each finger-receiving channel tend to give as a finger is inserted and naturally adapt to any further finger movement to maintain snug finger-receipt.In variations of the embodiment shown in FIGS. B to B and to assist snug finger-receipt: (i) each finger-receiving channel -may be shaped such that it narrows towards the finger tip end; (ii) each finger-receiving channel -may also be shaped such that it narrows towards its bottom; and (iii) each finger-receiving channel -may also be shaped such that its bottom has a curved profile that mirrors that curved profile of the underside of a user's finger in an outstretched but untensed configuration. In a typical usage operation, the user's inserted fingers grip the divider walls -of the finger-receiving channels -, thereby retaining the finger-receiving part of the body  adjacent to the fingers. The independent flexing of each of the finger-receiving channels -contributes to the ability of the interface to protect the user's fingers without hampering the movement of the user's hand and fingers. The hand-utility interface shown in FIGS. B to  is particularly suitable for use in hand dishwashing and/or scouring applications, wherein the foamed body  comprises an absorbent open cell foam body and material of the abrasive pad  is selected for this purpose.FIGS. B to B illustrate aspects of a yet further hand-utility interface  herein that may be appreciated to be a variation of that shown in FIGS. B to B. The interface  has a block form body  comprised of a polymeric foam material (e.g. closed cell foam). The body  is shaped to receive in use, the palm and fingers of a user and is provided with a slightly raised palm-receiving portion  shaped to snugly receive the underside a user's palm and four elongate U-shaped finger-receiving channels -. It will be seen that the finger-receiving channels -are divergent (i.e. that they spread naturally from the palm). In variations of this form the finger-receiving channels -may be set parallel to one another. The finger-receiving channels -may be seen to be defined by two outer walls -and three inner dividing walls -, which stand proud from the base  of the interface . An abrasive pad  is provided to the base  of the interface . In use, the finger channels -provide means to retain the interface on the user's hand. The user inserts a finger into each respective finger-receiving channel -where each finger is snugly received. The snug receipt is assisted by the resilience of the foam material comprising the body  which mean that the relevant walls -, -of each finger-receiving channel tend to give slightly as a finger is inserted and naturally adapt to any further finger movement to maintain snug finger-receipt. The finger-tip ends -are shaped such as to partially cover the upper parts of the user's fingers.To assist snug finger-receipt, the finger-receiving channels -, as defined by the two outer walls -and three inner dividing walls -, are provided with certain features as now described in detail. Firstly, overhangs  -; -are provided to the relevant walls -; -as shown, wherein each overhang  -; -is positioned in use, to contact that part of the upper surface of each user's finger (not shown) that is found beyond the knuckle. It may therefore be appreciated that in use, the overhangs,  -; -act such as to prevent the user's finger's from ‘falling out’ of the finger-receiving channels -. Secondly, the capped finger end -of each finger-receiving channel -defines a finger tip-receiving cavity -for snug receipt of each relevant finger tip of the user. Thirdly, a symmetrical “double plug” insert  is provided. The insert  is removable, and may be transferred from one side of the interface  to the other. As shown (left hand location) it allows for the use by a left handed person. With the insert  transferred to its right hand location, it renders the form usable by a right-handed person. The insert  has a “double plug” form. That is to say, it has two plug elements separated by a link . The two plug elements , are connected by the link , which sits in a receiving channel provided in the body . The insert  may be produced in identical soft foamed material to the body  or it may be produced in an alternative material. Where both the body  and the insert  are produced in soft foamed material this allows for the deformation necessary to insert the insert  and locks its link  portion into the body. Where these elements are produced in rigid or semi rigid material, it will be necessary to elongate the receiving channel, so that the link  may descend closer to the palm and be slid forward in the channel to allow the insert  to be driven home. Fourthly, convex protrusions -, -are provided to the walls of the inner two finger-channels -. These are designed to cooperate with the shape of the user's hand, in that from palm to first finger joint; there is a narrowing in the finger width. The soft convex protrusions -, -occupy this widening area and work to retain the body  against its possible forward movement off the fingers and hand.Finally, inner dividing walls and may be seen in FIG. B to have a height that increases slightly from the finger tip end to the palm-receiving end of the body , at which point a ‘yoke like’ projection , is provided. In use, each yoke-like projection , acts such as to retain the upper part of the user's hand to the body  by sitting between the fingers and above the skin at the crutch of the user's fingers. The projections , therefore provide support for the interface  preventing it from dropping down under the palm. In variations, projections may be applied to one, two (as shown) or all three of the finger dividing walls -and may be produced to any suitable extent and form over the back of the hand. In addition, cut is provided in the top of finger wall designed to ease closing of the hand by reducing the linear strength of the dividing wall in it upper portions. There may be any number of such cuts in one or more of the walls -, -as are appropriate for the specific intended purpose of the form. The base  of the block  may is provided with cut-away relieves . These also contribute to the ease of closing the hand, but in this instance their function is to reduce the bulk of base  material to be compressed. In a typical usage operation, the user's fingers grip the divider walls -of the finger-receiving channels -, thereby retaining the finger-receiving part of the body  adjacent to the fingers. The independent flexing of each of the finger-receiving channels -contributes to the ability of the glove to both protect the user's palm and fingers without hampering the movement of the user's hand and fingers.FIGS. B and to B illustrate aspects of a yet further hand-utility interface  herein that is a close variation of that shown in FIGS. B to B. The principal difference is in the alternative shape and form of the ‘yoke like’ projection . In the embodiment of FIGS. B and B, part or all of the ‘yoke like’ projection is produced in an alternative material, in order to have different characteristics from that of the body . For example, a more rigid material might be employed so as to give more strength of support, or and to extend that support further over the back of the hand.In an alternative aspect, the present invention relates to a pack for dispensing media in gel form. The media is suitably a detergent composition in gel form for use in household cleaning purposes.When using kitchen cloths, “Micro Fibre” cloths, abrasive sponges and other cleaning media to clean household surfaces, those where hygiene is important, it is necessary first to apply cleaning agent to the surface or to the cleaning media. The cleaning procedure commonly demands five procedural steps: (1) spray the surface to be cleaned; (2) pass the media under warm running water; (3) wring out excess water; (4) form the media into a manageable pad on the hand; and (5) commence cleaning of the surface by applying the media to the surface. Further, in practice it is very difficult to keep track of how long such cleaning media have been “in service”, and so it is difficult to determine the appropriate time to dispose of it or put it through the wash. Often the user will resort to checking how the media smells to assess its state of hygiene. There is a very real likelihood that such media will continue in use in the kitchen once it is actually spreading germs, rather than removing them. Additionally, disposable dry absorbent paper has the capacity to clear up spills but has no effect on dried on matter. Accordingly, it is necessary to revert to the above media types and their limitations. In this aspect, the present invention has three purposes: Firstly, to provide the cleaning abilities of such media in one combined form. Secondly, to reduce the number of procedural steps in the above-described surface cleaning process from five to three. The third purpose is to automatically maintain the cleaning media in hygienic condition throughout its service.According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a pack for dispensing gel form media comprising (a) a housing comprising resiliently collapsible walls supporting a rigid rim, said rigid rim defining a well, said well defining a well opening; (b) seating on the rigid rim, a plate having plural dispensing apertures provided thereto; and (c) within the well, a container for containing said gel form media, wherein said plate closes off the well opening such that the gel form media is dispensable from the container by applying pressure to the plate to cause collapse of the walls and thereby force gel form media through said plural dispensing apertures.The dispensing gel pack aspect of the present invention will now be described further with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:FIG. B shows a plan view from above of a first hand-utility interface particularly suitable for use with a gel pack in accord with one aspect of the present invention;\n\nFIG.

B shows a plan view of the fourth gel pack of FIG. B; and\n\nFIG. B shows a plan view of a hand-utility interface resting superior to the fourth gel pack of FIG. B;FIGS. B to B illustrate aspects of a first hand-utility interface  suitable for use with a gel pack herein. The interface  has a block form body  comprised of a polymeric foam material (e.g. closed cell foam). Preferably, the body  is a waterproof skinned form block that is moulded in supple foam. The body  is shaped to receive in use, the fingers of a user and is provided with four elongate U-shaped finger-receiving channels -. The finger-receiving channels -may be seen to be defined by two outer walls and three inner dividing walls -, which stand proud from the base  of the interface . The base  of the interface  is provided with parallel -lines of Velcro (trade name) like material (i.e. the hook element of a hook and loop attachment system) for releasable attachment of abrasive pad . In use, the finger channels -act such as to retain the interface  on the user's hand. The user inserts a finger into each respective finger-receiving channel -where each finger is snugly received. The snug receipt is assisted by the resilience of the foam material comprising the body  which mean that the relevant walls -, -of each finger-receiving channel tend to give slightly as a finger is inserted and naturally adapt to any further finger movement to maintain snug finger-receipt. Each finger-tip end -is shaped such as to partially cover the upper parts of the user's fingers.To assist snug finger-receipt, the finger-receiving channels -, as defined by the two outer walls -and three inner dividing walls -, are provided with overhangs -; -, wherein each overhang -; -is positioned in use, to contact that part of the upper surface of each user's finger (not shown) that is found beyond the knuckle. It may therefore be appreciated that in use, the overhangs  -; -act such as to prevent the user's finger's from ‘falling out’ of the finger-receiving channels -. In a typical usage operation, the user's fingers grip the divider walls -of the finger receiving channels -, thereby retaining the finger-receiving part of the body  adjacent to the fingers. The independent flexing of each of the finger-receiving channels -contributes to the ability of the glove to both protect the user's palm and fingers without hampering the movement of the user's hand and fingers.FIG. B show a gel pack  herein arranged broadly to cooperate with the hand-utility interface of . The gel pack  comprises a top plate  provided with a gel sack  comprising detergent in gel form. At its top, the skin of the gel sack  is welded to the underside of the top plate . Arranged circumferential to the plate , there is further provided compressible foam ring  (e.g. of soft skinned foam). The plate  comprises a series of apertures , the purpose of which will become clearer from the later description. Peel off adhesive seal  is provided to seal off those apertures  until the gel pack  is ready for use. In the gel pack of FIG. B the top plate  and foam ring  comprise a durable element of the gel pack and the gel sack  (i.e. the container that holds the gel) and adhesive seal  are disposable elements thereof.In use, the gel sack  suitably contains a combination of cleaning and/or disinfecting gel . The adhesive seal  of the gel pack is first removed. A suitable hand-utility interface  (e.g. as shown in FIGS. B-) is taken and the abrasive pad  (or other underside cleaning media surface of the interface) is moistened under a tap with warm water. The hand utility interface is then brought into contact with the gel pack  as shown in FIG. B and pressed down onto the top plate . This pressing down action causes the foam ring  to compress, the gel sack  to give slightly and the gel content  thereof to be forced upwards through the apertures , and onto the pad  on the underside of the hand-utility interface . The greater the downward pressure, the greater the volume of gel  applied to the interface . With the interface  suitably loaded with gel  the cleaning work can commence. Periodically, the interface  is returned under warm running water to clear the collected matter, compressed by clenching the hand to expel excess water, and again pressed onto the top plate  of the gel pack  to pick up more cleaning agent or gel. Once the cleaning activity is complete, the interface  is rinsed, excess water is expelled, and it the may be replaced on the top plate  of the gel pack  and again pressed downwards so that the underside  thereof is again charged with cleaning agent and disinfectant. The effect being that the interface  may continue to disinfect itself while it is waiting its next deployment.In a variation of the gel pack of FIG. B, now shown in FIG. B, top plate  and foam ring  comprise a durable element of the gel pack  that is separable from disposable pack  comprising container  for containing gel and adhesive seal  provided to the container . Commercially, the disposable pack  may be arranged for sale separately as a refill component for the durable part of the pack. Alternatively, a kit of parts comprising the separate durable pack and disposable refill parts may be sold.In yet another fully disposable embodiment of the gel pack  shown in FIG. B, top plate  and compressible concertina-form circumferential wall  comprise integral elements of the container  for containing gel. Suitably, the pack is formed by a blow moulding process. Adhesive lid seal  (e.g. a plastic polymer or foil lid) is provided to the container . Use of the pack is by removal of the lid seal  and application of pressure to the top plate to cause resilient collapse of the concertina form wall , thereby causing dispensing of gel through the top plate . Commercially, the disposable pack  may be arranged for sale as a unit that is designed for disposal once the gel contents are exhausted. Usage of the embodiments of FIGS. B and  corresponds to those usage steps described in respect of the embodiment of FIG. B.FIGS. B and B show views of another gel pack , which is designed for wall mounting so as to avoid taking up limited work top space. FIG. B shows a hand-utility interface  resting superior to the gel pack  of FIG. B. The hand-utility interface may for example, take the detailed form of any hand-utility interface described herein such as that of FIGS. B- or B-. The gel pack  comprises a plate  provided with a plural gel sacks -, each comprising detergent in gel form. The gel sacks -are formed in a fine non-rigid polyethylene skin. At its top, the skin of each gel sack -is welded to the underside of the top plate . Arranged circumferential to the plate , there is further provided compressible foam ring  (e.g. of soft skinned foam). The plate  comprises a series of apertures  arranged to coincide with the location of a gel riser channel  provided to each gel sack -. Peel off adhesive seal  is provided to seal off those apertures  until the gel pack is ready for use. Each gel sack -is provided with one or more support pads , which serve to prevent the part empty gel sack -from drooping so that residual contents fail to reach the access point to the riser channels . The gel pack  mounts to a supporting back plate , which is provide with a number of double-sided sticky pads  for securing the gel pack unit  to a wall (e.g. in a bathroom or kitchen). The dotted lines of FIG. B indicate the pattern of weld lines  which secure the polythene skin of the gel sacks -and the riser channels  to the back of surface of the top plate . This arrangement of FIGS. B to B is suitable for dispensing a fluid in addition to a gel. For fluid dispensing it is vital that the release apertures  are set at a slightly higher level than the top line of the reservoir defined by each gel sack -Operation for the vertically mountable format is broadly the same as for that described earlier. An alternative arrangement to prevent leakage of fluid in a gel pack  arranged for vertical mounting is to provide that the apertures  are configured as valves, which release fluid or high viscosity gel only under pressure. Such arrangements as are used to prevent leakage in infant drinking vessels may be appropriate in this regard. Indeed it may be that the top plate  is produced in such material. An alternative arrangement for a gel pack is that it is produced as a very much as a cake of soap, but having its own wall attachment means. In this configuration, the hand-utility interface is wiped down the surface of the cake to pick up its cleaning agent load. This gel pack herein is produced with hygiene and domestic surface care in mind, however it has very much wider application. Its potential application extends to all situations and environments where distribution of gels, fluids or liquids is desirable. Such environments exist in Beauty Care, Patient Care, DIY, Auto Care, Professional Cleaning to name but a few.The present invention relates in another aspect to a cleaning tool for use in domestic and professional cleaning applications, particularly for use in cleaning kitchen surfaces. In domestic and commercial kitchens, and in dining environments, cloths, wet wipes and sponges are used to clean the surfaces. These cleaning media are inefficient in that they demand extra special effort on the part of the user if they are to be persuaded to also pick up and remove crumbs and other small detritus. The purpose of this invention is to provide a cleaning media and means of application which are configured so that crumb collection and surface cleaning are combined in one convenient unit and the exercise of combined cleaning made faster and the cleaning outcome of a higher standard. A crumb-collecting element is provided as an adaptation or additional feature of the various hand-utility interfaces described hereinbefore.According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a tool for cleaning particulate debris from a surface comprising a body for applying a froth-creating cleaning agent to said surface, said body defining a cutaway portion; and provided to said cutaway portion, a framework for accommodating froth arising from the froth-creating agent to provide a froth trap for said particulate debris. Particulate debris can include crumbs and other particulate detritus that may be found on the surface to be cleaned. The body may have any suitable form including the form of that of the body of any of the hand-utility interfaces described hereinbefore. Suitably, the body is a foamed block. The froth-creating cleaning agent is typically a detergent comprising a surfactant that is arranged in use to froth and foam. The body defines a cutaway portion, which may either be produced by physically cutting away part of the block or be shaped into the block by any other means including as a moulded form. The cutaway portion is provided with a framework for accommodating froth arising in use, from the froth-creating agent to provide a froth trap for said particulate debris.In use, the body is typically driven across a surface, thereby permitting entrance of the particulate debris into the framework where upon they become trapped by the froth trap. The framework is designed to cooperate with the surface tension/meniscus of the froth such that the framework supports the froth and by so doing prolongs its existence, thereby defining the required froth trap. During or after use, the trapped debris may be cleared from the froth trap by a flush of running water. In one aspect, the framework has the form of an open spiral of any suitable cross section. In another aspect, the framework comprises loops of any suitable cross section. In a further aspect, the framework comprises an arrangement of stalks/filaments.First application of the cleaning tool is in kitchen and, dining surface cleaning. However application extends to all environments and all hard surfaces where collection and removal of small-scale debris is desired. These circumstances for example, exist in retail, commercial, medical, industrial, and travel environments.The cleaning tool aspect of the present invention will now be described further with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:—FIG. B shows a side view of a first crumb-collecting element herein;\n\nFIG. B shows a side section through the first crumb-collecting element ofFIG. B shows a side section through a second crumb-collecting element herein.\n\nReferring now to FIGS. B and B, which show a first crumb-collecting element that may be arranged as an adaptation of a hand-utility interface herein, for example having the detailed form of that shown in FIG. B. The base  of the hand-utility interface  is provided with a cutaway section  for accommodating the crumb-collecting element. The crumb-collecting element comprises wire framework  produced in stainless steel or plastic, or metal with a plastic coating. This wire framework  might be as shown, with vertical elements spaced apart by a horizontal connection, and having a “D” side section, this might alternatively be a round or other side section. A further alternative form envisages a simple spiral or round or other section.  shows that provision of the “D” section in the wire framework  allows the unit  to get right up to a vertical obstruction such as the splash back at the rear of a kitchen work top. However, where such considerations are unimportant, for example in clearing dining tables, a round section framework might be more advantageously employed. In this scenario, the leading edge of the surface cleaning element  might advance so that, in side section, it concludes directly under the centre of the circle described by the wire framework . The advantage being that the foamed area is, in part ahead of the leading edge of the cleaning media, thus making collection more efficient.The wire framework  may alternatively be created as part of the injection moulding of the hand-utility interface . The surface cleaning element  may be a permanently fixed element or alternatively it may be a replaceable disposable element. This element  is formed such that it tapers at its perimeter so as to permit “riding-up” of the crumb detritus. The crumb-collecting element further comprises a peripheral flange  in plastic, which is welded to the surface cleaning element . The vertical wall  of this flange  assists the surface cleaning element  to locate with the interface . At the top of this vertical wall  hooks are provided (not shown), which catch over the horizontal element of the wire framework . The flange  also has a fold element  that defines a channel . In use, this channel  is filled with or arranged to collect a warm water-soluble foaming agent. The flange  may have apertures  through to the surface-cleaning element  adjacent to the access to the foaming agent channel . These apertures  assist the foaming by allowing air and moisture, the result of compression of the surface cleaning element  in use, to pass upwards through the flange  layer. These apertures  being formed to work as valves, preventing the foaming agent descending from the channel  into the cleaning element  is desirable, to prevent leaving foam on the surface to be cleaned.This invention envisages a possible alternative leading edge for the flange element , which extends horizontal to the surface being cleared. The advantage of this possibility is improved crumb and/or detritus collection; the disadvantage is that the cleaning element  does not reach the margin of the worktop where a vertical obstacle such as a splash back exists.Embodiments are envisaged in which, the wire framework  comprises part disposable media. It is also envisaged that further that the wire framework  might be created out of the body matter of the disposable media. In this respect, it is noted that abrasive media is in effect a series of fine filaments that may be formed into suitable shapes (e. g. loops and spirals) thereby saving a separate production and fixing operation. Any number of vertical cuts  may be produced in the vertical wall  of the flange . This serves to permit flexing of the whole unit  to permit wringing out.Use of the hand-utility interface adapted with the first crumb-collecting element is now described. Before use, the lower elements , are made wet under warm running water. The interface unit  is squeezed by clenching in the fist, in order to expel excess water. This wetting causes release of the first of the foam cells contained in the channel , which expand to fill the void created described by the wire framework . The wire framework  provides a framework, which supports a foam meniscus, in much the same way, as does the plastic loop of a child's bubble blowing toy. The combination of wire framework  and the meniscus of the foam stretched between it, and the foam's inherent sticky nature, acts like a trap to retain crumbs and such detritus. With each cleaning task complete, the unit  is rinsed under the tap, where the run of water washes around the wire enclosure  flushing out the crumbs etc. and activates more foam for the unit's continued deployment.In another use process, the interface is again is wetted under the tap. The wire framework  made to contact a gel dispenser pack (e.g. as described above in relation to FIGS. B to B) to put detergent gel at the leading edge thereof. The user presses the unit  down a few times (e.g. on the work top) such that the squeezed air+gel+moisture generates froth/bubbles in the wire framework . The unit is now ready for use. An alternative arrangement where the nature of the foaming agent is such that it does not require the support afforded by the wire framework  could eliminate the need for that wire framework . However secondary beneficial effects of the wire framework, such as its physical assistance in preventing escape of the debris would be lost.Referring now to FIG. B, which shows a second crumb-collecting element herein comprising hand-utility interface  in the form of a soft waterproof skinned foam block. The hand-utility interface  is provided at its base with Velcro (trade name) hooks  arranged for interaction with corresponding Velcro (trade name) loops  provided to a wet wipe , thereby attaching the wet wipe  to the hand-utility interface . A semi-rigid flange  (e.g. ring form) is fixed to the periphery of the wipe . The flange  rises up from its periphery to its inside edge  to form a slight incline. The flange  is also provided with apertures  therein that can allow foam from a foaming agent to rise there through and create a sticky deposit on the upper surface of the flange . Crush-releasable foam-releasing cells  are provided adjacent to the apertures  as the source of foam.In use, the user applies downward pressure to the hand-utility interface  with the wipe  held adjacent to a flat surface. The inside edge  of the peripheral flange  of the wipe  is thereby depressed such as to apply compressive force to the foam-releasing cells . The released foam is in turn, squeezed up through the apertures  such that it sits as a sticky foam deposit on the upper surface of the flange . As the hand-utility interface  and flanged wet wipe  is then passed over a surface for cleaning any crumbs or other such detritus on such surface come into contact with the flange  and adhere to the sticky foam deposit on the upper surface of thereof. In essence, the sticky nature of the foam deposit on the flange  acts like a trap to retain crumbs and such detritus. Once the cleaning operation is completed the wet wipe  and its peripheral flange  is discarded and a fresh wipe may be applied for use in subsequent cleaning operations.The elements shown in FIGS. B and B may surround the whole of the perimeter of the application means, or they may be present in certain areas only. The hand-utility interface may be of any outline shape. It is advantageous to have at least one protruding angular element for getting into corners. The spacing between the vertical, or partially inclined, element of the wire framework  of FIGS. B and B may be set differently from one product offering to another. In one product offering, the spacing between the vertical, or partially inclined, element of the wire framework may be varied in different parts of the product, so to deal with differing scales of debris.The cleaning element  may comprise any of the commonly used media, but in particular. Micro-Fibre cloth, abrasives, absorbent sponges and their like. Of particular benefit will be cleaning elements  that present a combination of media in order that some scouring may happen together with some absorption, together with some polishing. In such instance, the cleaning element may comprise bands of different media in stripes of any pattern, or segments radiating form some centre point or line, or concentric circles or any other configuration of assembly. As a further possibility the varying media may be provided in patches of any shape and size. As a further possibility the varying media may be created by provision of single alternating filaments of each different media side by side. As a still further possibility, the media might be loaded/peppered with time-release bright coloured disinfectant loaded cells. The cells would start to release their disinfectant as soon as the media is first made wet, and continues to release until a preset time. All colour vanishes when the cells are exhausted of disinfectant.Possible alternatives to the wire framework  do exist. Viewed in the front elevation the unit may present “windows” or loops of any convenient size and outline. In this approach it is most advantageous that the windows are created as part of the flange  and in such a way as no bottom part of the “window frame” exists, as this would create an obstacle to the collection of debris. Such windows may need to take account of the interface's  need to be crushed in the hand for wringing out, and so be configured in a manner that permits such action.Apparatus incorporating the crumb-collecting element described above may be designed to co-operate with, or to form a part of, floor washing means which provides that the general detritus [which has traditionally been collected by sweeping and use of the dust pan & brush prior to washing the floor] can now be lifted and removed by the single action of washing the floor. The apparatus herein provides a trap along the leading edge of the floor washing medium, a trap which detritus is forced to enter by the forward movement of the medium. The trap forms a narrow strip, which is pressed against the floor by the application medium. The trap is a narrow gauge strip of plastic or such like, having multiple fine stalks arranged in stepped rows so that the stalks of alternate rows, when viewed in front elevation, are placed directly between those of the adjacent rows. These stalks may be resilient or flexible, but preferably flexible. Suitably, the free ends of these stalks are formed (e.g. with end feet) to present one or other of the following: —“plates”: Flat circular (or any other shape) plates of absolute minimum thickness with the stalk rising centrally from it; —“hooks”: Not unlike Velcro (trade name); —“beads”: Round or other bulbous forms but preferably circular plates of a diameter which leaves a small gap between each plate and those adjacent to it.When wetted by the floor cleaning solution, the surface tension of that liquid forming on and around the stalks/plates, will cause small particles of dirt to become trapped in such a way that a flush of water will clear the matter. The above “trap” system might work in cooperation with the following media types. Roller squeeze out sponge media and apparatus: [e.g. a roller squeezable mop of the type sold by the Vileda company] Hinged squeeze out sponge media and apparatus: [e.g. a hinged squeezable mop of the type sold by the Addis company] In an alternative arrangement, the apparatus herein is designed for use with disposable wet wipe pads in association with deploying apparatus which distributes cleaning fluid: [e.g. for use with that cleaning apparatus sold under the trade name Dettol Easy Mop] In this application the performance can be improved by the incorporation of foam. The goal here is that the space within the “forest” of stalks (and above the upper surface of the plates) is filled with a sticky foam. The proposal here is that a dry deposit should be incorporated attaching to one or another surface of the forest, and which is activated by contact with the cleaning fluid (the catalyst) to expand and fill the interior space between the stalks. It is desirable that the foam's volume is controlled no that fully expanded it does not spread beyond the interior confines of the assembly of stalks. The effect of the combination of foam and assembly of stalks is to provide a very efficient magnet for all manner of detritus. The scale of debris accommodated within the assembly of stalks can be increased by spacing the stalks and their end feet (e.g. plates) out and altering the foam characteristics so that it has the capacity to maintain itself and, in effect, bridge the gaps relying only on its own nature.The invention will now be described further with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:—FIG. B shows an end elevation section through the head of a floor mop apparatus herein;\n\nFIG. B is an underside plan view of part of the crumb collecting elements of the apparatus of ;\n\nFIG. B is a side view of the part of the crumb collecting elements of FIG. B; and\n\nFIG. B shows an end section of a suitable wet wipe arrangement\n\nReferring now to those Figures, there is shown at FIG. B the head of a floor mop apparatus  (e.g. of the type sold under the trade name Dettol Easy Mop) adapted to provide enhanced collecting or crumbs or other detritus. The top part  of the floor mop apparatus  is typically provided with a cleaning fluid bottle (not shown). The base part  of the apparatus is in hinged attachment with the top part  and configured to allow that a tubular section  of a disposable cleaning pad  can be slipped over the base part , which is then shut and snap-locked in the closed position. The leading edge of the cleaning pad  is provided a wrap around plastic strip (or flange) . The upper portion of this plastic strip  is clamped by closure of the upper  and lower body  parts to provide downward pressure on the leading edge of the cleaning pad . To provide a crumb-collector, flange  is provided with an arrangement of stalks  at the under surface  thereof. It will be noted that the end of each stalk  defines a plate , which in use, presents a generally horizontal end surface to the floor to be cleaned.FIGS. B and B show more details of the arrangement of stalks  that define a trap strip , and shows the preferred arrangement of the stalk plates  defined at the end of each stalk . As an alternative to the foam, loose individual long fibres may be employed running the length of the strip  and intertwined with the stalks . This will serve to augment the trap. In a further alternative application, the crumb-collecting element described herein may be applied to a “simple sheet” Floor Wet Wipe: [e.g. of the type sold under the trade name Swiffer by The Procter and Gamble Company]. In this instance, the Wet Wipe is wrapped around and fixed by one means or another to suitable pad with a long handle. Here, the trap strip should form a part of the wipe, better still, two trap strips should be fitted, one to sit at either long side of the pad/handle arrangement. The reverse of the strips might be configured to provide plastic/nylon spikes, which serve as the means of attachment of the wipe to the pad, by snap locking into reception apertures. The action of this snap locking could be made to puncture a foam sack contained within each trap strip and so release the foam into the forest.FIG. B shows an end section of a suitable wet wipe arrangement comprising a body , to which a disposable wipe sheet  is provided. Trap strip  is arranged lie circumferential to the wipe sheet , and is held in place by a spike location and fixing snap lock  for attachment of the wipe  and trap strip  to the pad body . Associated with the trap strip  is an assembly of stalks  with end plates . FIG. B also shows the concept of graduating the length of the stalks  in the trap , longer at the leading edge and shorter at the inside edge. The benefit of this alternative arrangement is that larger particles can be caught and trapped.In an aspect the invention provides a pack for dispensing gel form media comprising (a) a housing comprising resiliently collapsible walls supporting a rigid rim, said rigid rim defining a well, said well defining a well opening; (b) seating on the rigid rim, a plate having plural dispensing apertures provided thereto; and (c) within the well, a container for containing said gel form media, wherein said plate closes off the well opening such that the gel form media is dispensable from the container by applying pressure to the plate to cause collapse of the walls and thereby force gel form media through said plural dispensing apertures.In a further aspect the invention provides a tool for cleaning particulate debris from a surface comprising a body for applying a froth-creating cleaning agent to said surface, said body defining a cutaway portion; and provided to said cutaway portion, a framework for accommodating froth arising from the froth-creating agent to provide a froth trap for said particulate debris.In a further aspect the invention provides a multi-layer form cleaning cloth comprising: (a) an absorbent cloth layer; (b) adjacent to said absorbent cloth layer, a perforate layer comprising at least partly non-transparent material; and (c) adjacent to said perforate layer, a fluid impermeable layer comprising at least partly a transparent material, said fluid impermeable layer joining to said perforate layer such that a reservoir for receipt of cleaning media is defined, wherein the non-transparent perforate layer is visible through the transparent liquid impermeable layer when the reservoir is empty of cleaning media.The invention is not limited to the embodiments above-described and features of any of the embodiments may be employed separately or in combination with features of the same or a different embodiment and all combinations of features to produce a hand utility interface within the spirit and scope of the present invention."

                "Not ApplicableNot ApplicableNot ApplicableThis invention pertains to the electronics and tele-communications fields. There are currently over 270 million cell phone users in the United States alone. A majority of these people also use their phones to send text messages, or “texting”, which allows the user to type text messages on a miniaturized keyboard. The individual keys on today's modern electronic devices are so small that the user's thumbs often depress more than one key. Repetitive texting can also cause calluses on the tips of the thumbs.Thumb-eez were invented with a two fold objective: to minimize mistakes, and to prevent the formation of calluses on the thumbs. Thumb-eez permit more precise typing by reducing surface area at the point of contact; this is achieved through the utilization of projecting nibs, or styli, which allows pinpoint accuracy. Thumb-eez also prevent calluses by creating a buffer zone between the thumbs and the keypad.Thumb-eez were conceptualized by Romney Prince in the summer of 2009, but the idea did not gain traction until he mentioned it to Brent Parris; the two then corroborated on the technical aspects of the design.In their most basic form, Thumb-eez are essentially thimbles with protruding nibs, or styli, extending from the tips (FIGS. ,,& ). Thumb-eez are worn on the human thumbs and the nibs, or styli, are situated on the underside of the design to correspond with the pressure point of the thumb (). Thumb-eez have a small opening at the anterior tip that allows the thumbnail to extend through the opening (). An alternate design also has additional nibs, or styli, located on the sides of the design, that allow the user to further access and depress adjacent keys by rotating the thumbs outward (FIGS. ,, & ).Thumb-eez will be made out of a thermoplastic material, most likely through injection molding. The nibs, or styli, should be rubber coated to prevent damage to the device's keyboards and/or touch-screens. Thumb-eez will theoretically be clear to allow the user to visualize the keyboard, but they can be manufactured in any color, or even have customized logos and/or designs. Thumb-eez will employ a tapered design to accommodate any size thumb. Thumb-eez will be sold by the pair and will contain a small circular flange on the posterior end through which a lanyard passes, which tethers the Thumb-eez together ()."

                "This application is a continuation of and claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Non-Provisional patent application Ser. No. 11/778,134, filed on Jul. 16, 2007, which claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/820,531, filed on Jul. 27, 2006, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.The present invention generally relates to garments and, more particularly, to garments that incorporate a seat.Hunting vests or the like exist that incorporate a seat. Various strap with buckles, retain the seat in a stowed position on the rear or back side of the vest using one or more straps. When use of the seat is desired, one or more of the straps may be unhooked or unbuckled. Each of the straps also may be unhooked or unbuckled to totally disconnect the seat from the hunting vest. In any case, the hunter typically either grasps the seat and holds the same against his/her butt and sits down on the seat, or the hunter manually places the seat onto the relevant supporting structure (e.g., the ground) and then sits on the same.Although the above-noted type of hunting vest offers certain advantages, noise is a concern when disconnecting the seat from the hunting vest for subsequent use. Operating the buckles/hooks may spook nearby game. Also, in many cases a hunter will want to move very short distances after getting situated. This of course requires the hunter to manually move the seat. If the hunter is going to move any significant distance, the hunter will typically manually re-attach the seat to the hunting vest. This is time consuming and also generates undesired noise through engagement of buckles or the like. There is also of course the risk that the hunter will forget the disconnected seat when moving as well.A first aspect of the present invention is generally directed to a garment assembly. This garment assembly includes a garment, a seat, and at least one elastic member that interconnects the garment and the seat.Various refinements exist of the features noted in relation to the first aspect of the present invention. Further features may also be incorporated in the first aspect of the present invention as well. These refinements and additional features may exist individually or in any combination. The garment may be of any appropriate size, shape, configuration, and/or type. For instance, the garment may be in the form of a jacket, a vest, a life jacket, a shirt, a coat, a parka, a backpack, or a sporting event seat. The garment may also be used for any appropriate application, such as hunting, fishing, boating, camping, hiking, attending sporting events, or the like. The garment may include any feature or combination of features for the relevant application (e.g., pockets, shell holders). The seat also may be detachably interconnected with the garment so as to be totally separable from the garment, or the seat may somehow remain interconnected with the garment at all times.First and second elastic strap sections may interconnect the seat and the garment in the case of the first aspect. One portion of each of these first and second elastic strap sections may be attached or fixed at any appropriate location and in any appropriate manner to the garment (e.g., an end of the first and second elastic strap sections). Another portion of each of the first and second elastic strap sections may be associated with first and second sides, respectively, of the seat. For instance, the first and second elastic strap sections may be part of a single strap that extends side-to-side through the interior of the seat. In this case, the first and second elastic strap sections may not in fact be attached or fixed to the seat, but would appropriately interface or interact with the seat. However, the first and second elastic strap sections could in fact be attached or fixed to the seat in any appropriate manner and at any appropriate location (e.g., the first and second strap sections may be separate structures), for instance at or near the opposing sides of the seat. In any case, a separate buckle or the like may be associated with each of the first and second elastic strap sections to facilitate the detachable interconnection of the seat with the garment if desired/required.Generally, the above-noted first and second elastic strap sections may stretch or extend to accommodate movement of the seat from a stowed position to a deployed position in the case of the first aspect. As will be discussed in more detail below in relation to the second aspect of the present invention, this movement may be characterized as a pivoting or pivotal-like motion of the seat (e.g., the front of the seat pivoting at least generally about the rear of the seat), as a “flipping” of the seat, or as an inversion of the seat.Additional straps may be used to interconnect the seat with the garment in the case of the first aspect, although such may not be required in all instances. For instance, two or more straps may engage each of the garment and the seat at or near the rear of the seat. The straps may facilitate movement of the seat from the stowed position to a deployed position in a pivoting or pivotal-like motion, such that these particular straps may be referred to as “hinging” straps or the like. In any case, each of these hinging straps may include a buckle or the like to facilitate the detachable interconnection of the seat with the garment if desired/required.One function of the elastic member in the case of the first aspect is to facilitate deployment of the seat from a stowed position to a deployed position. Generally, the elastic member may be stretched or extended to move the seat from the stowed position to a deployed position. The elastic member may also resiliently bias the seat into engagement with a user when the seat is in a deployed position (e.g., so as to maintain contact between the seat and a butt of the user, particularly when the user is in a standing position). In any case, movement of the seat between the stowed position and any deployed position does not require disconnecting the seat from the garment in any manner in one embodiment.A second aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of deploying a seat that is associated with a garment. Movement of the seat from a stowed position to a first deployed position entails stretching or extending at least one interconnection between the seat and garment.Various refinements exist of the features noted in relation to the second aspect of the present invention. Further features may also be incorporated in the second aspect of the present invention as well. These refinements and additional features may exist individually or in any combination. The garment used by the second aspect may be in accordance with the garment discussed above in relation to the first aspect.The movement of the seat from the stowed position to a first deployed position in the case of the second aspect may be characterized as a pivoting of the seat, as an inversion of the seat, as a flipping of the seat, or as a movement of a front of the seat at least generally about a rear of the seat. In one embodiment and regardless of the characterization of the type of motion of the seat during deployment, the seat need not be disconnected from the garment to move from a stowed position to a first deployed position. That is, using at least one elastic interconnection between the seat and the garment may be incorporated in a manner that alleviates the need to disconnect the seat in any manner from the garment in order to move the same from a stowed position to a first deployed position. Stated another way, all interconnections that exist between the seat and the garment when the seat is in the stowed position may be maintained as/while the seat is moved from its stowed position to a first deployed position.The interconnection between the seat and garment may include a first strap that is stretched at least at some point in time during the movement of the seat from its stowed position to a first deployed position in the case of the second aspect. This stretching of the first strap increases its length, and may be followed by a subsequent contraction or retraction of the first strap that in turn decreases its length. In a first embodiment, the length of the strap is increased in moving the seat from its stowed position to an intermediate position (where such an intermediate position is between the stowed position and a first deployed position), and thereafter the length of the first strap is decreased in moving from the intermediate position to a first deployed position. In a second embodiment, the first strap is of a first length when the seat is in the stowed position, the movement of the seat from the stowed position to an intermediate position stretches or extends the first strap to a second length, and the first strap contracts to a third length at least at some point in time during the movement of the seat from the intermediate position to the first deployed position. In this second embodiment, the third length of the first strap (associated with the seat being in a first deployed position) is greater than the first length of the first strap (associated with the seat being in the stowed position), the seat is pulled into contact with a user of the garment by the first strap when the seat is in the first deployed position, or both.The movement of the seat from the stowed position to a first deployed position may be accommodated by an elasticity or resiliency of at least one interconnection between the seat and the garment in the case of the second aspect. Furthermore, this elasticity or resiliency of at least one interconnection between the seat and the garment in the case of the second aspect may maintain contact between the seat and a user when the seat is in a first deployed position (e.g., at least one interconnection between the seat and the garment may “pull” the seat into contact with the user when the seat is in a first deployed position). This is particularly advantageous when the user moves from a standing position to a seated position, in that the user does not need to hold onto the seat at this time. Moreover, the manner in which the seat may be integrated with the garment (through the use of at least one elastic interconnection) also allows the user to move from a seated position to a standing position, to move to a new location, and then again sit down on the seat as the user does not need to hold onto the seat throughout this time and the seat will simply “follow” the user.A third aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of deploying a seat that is associated with a garment. The seat is maintained in a stowed position relative to the garment using at least one interconnection between the garment and the seat. However, the seat may be moved from this stowed position to a first deployed position. Notably, each interconnection between the garment and seat (which is used to maintain the seat in the stowed position) may be retained or maintained during movement of the seat from the stowed position to the first deployed position. Therefore, there is no need to disconnect the seat from the garment in any manner when moving the seat from the stowed position to the first deployed position in the case of the third aspect. The various features discussed above in relation to the second aspect may be used by this third aspect, individually or in any combination.Additional features and advantages are described herein, and will be apparent from the following Detailed Description and the figures.One embodiment of a garment assembly is illustrated in  and is identified by reference numeral . The garment assembly  includes a garment  and a deployable seat . The garment  may be of any appropriate size, shape, configuration, and/or type, and may be used for any appropriate application (e.g., hunting). For instance, the garment  may be in the form of a jacket, vest, life jacket, shirt, coat, parka, backpack, or sporting event seat. In the illustrated embodiment, the garment  is in the form of a vest (e.g., a hunting vest).The deployable seat  includes a top or upper surface , a bottom or lower surface , a pair of side or side surfaces , a front or front surface , and a rear or rear surface . The seat  may be of any appropriate size, shape, and/or configuration, and may incorporate any appropriate supporting material or combination of supporting materials. Moreover, any desirable properties may be incorporated/utilized by any of the surfaces ,,,, (e.g., the bottom or lower surface  of the seat  may be waterproof; the entire exterior of the seat  may be waterproof).A pair of lower strap assemblies or hinging strap assemblies  interconnect the garment  and the seat , and may facilitate the deployment of the seat  in a manner that will be discussed in more detail below. Each lower strap assembly  may include a buckle  () to facilitate detachably interconnecting the garment  and seat . Any appropriate number of lower strap assemblies  may be used, each lower strap assembly  may be fixed at any appropriate location on each of the garment  and seat  and in any appropriate manner, multiple lower strap assemblies  may be disposed in any appropriate arrangement, and each lower strap assembly  may use one or more straps of any appropriate type (e.g., elastic; non-elastic). In the illustrated embodiment, each lower strap assembly  is fixed to the seat  at or near its rear . It may be possible to alleviate the lower strap assemblies  altogether, although again the use of the lower strap assemblies  may facilitate the deployment of the seat .The garment assembly  further includes a pair of upper strap sections  that each interconnect with the garment  and that each at least interface or interact with the seat . In the illustrated embodiment, the upper strap sections  are actually part of a single strap that extends through the interior of the seat  via a side-to-side aperture  () that is incorporated by the seat  (e.g., an intermediate section of this single strap extends through the seat  and joins with each of the upper strap sections ). The upper strap sections  could also be separate structures and separately attached or fixed to the seat  in any appropriate manner and at any appropriate location. In any case, an end of each upper strap section  is fixed or mounted to the garment  in any appropriate manner and at any appropriate location. In the illustrated embodiment, a buckle  is provided for each upper strap section  to detachably interconnect the garment  with the seat  at two additional locations. The upper strap sections  and the lower strap assemblies  thereby support the seat  in its stowed position of . Although the seat  may be detachably interconnected with the garment  so as to be totally separable from the garment  as thus far described, it should be appreciated that at least one interconnection may remain between the seat  and the garment  at all times (not shown).Each upper strap section  also interfaces with the seat  at a pair of laterally spaced locations, or along each of the two sides  of the seat  as noted. In the illustrated embodiment where the upper strap sections  are part of a common strap, the upper strap sections  are not actually fixed to the seat  as noted. However and once again, it should be appreciated that the upper strap sections  could indeed be separate structures, with one portion (e.g., one end) of each such upper strap section  being appropriately fixed or mounted to the garment  and with another portion.(e.g., the opposite end) of each such upper strap section  being appropriately fixed or mounted to the seat  in any appropriate manner.The upper strap sections  of the garment assembly  facilitate deployment of the seat , and notably without having to disconnect the seat  from the garment  of the garment assembly  in any manner. In this regard, the upper strap sections  are each able to extend or stretch (i.e., increase in length) some time during deployment of the seat . More specifically, each upper strap section  extends or stretches (i.e., increases in length) during the initial portion of the deployment of the seat , and thereafter may contract (i.e., decreases in length) during a subsequent portion of the deployment of the seat . Preferably, each upper strap section  is formed from an appropriate elastic or other appropriate resilient material, such that each upper strap section  may extend or stretch when exposed to an appropriate force, and thereafter uses stored internal energy or the like to contract or retract to at least some degree upon experiencing at least a certain reduction of this force (including via a pure elastic deformation, where each upper strap section  would move back to its undeformed state once a load is totally removed).illustrate three representative positions for the seat .  illustrates a stowed position for the seat , where the bottom or lower surface  of the seat  faces the back side of the garment  and where the top or upper surface  of the seat  faces away from the back side of the garment . The upper strap sections  may “pull” the seat  against the garment  at this time (e.g., to resiliently bias the seat  against the garment , particularly when being worn by a user), although such is not required (e.g., the upper strap sections  may be in tension or stretched with the seat  in its stowed position).  illustrates a representative intermediate position of the seat , or a partially deployed position, while  illustrates a representative deployed position of the seat  (i.e., other deployed positions may exist). Generally, the seat  may be characterized as' being pivoted, flipped, or inverted to move from the stowed position of  to the deployed position of  (e.g., the deployment of the seat  may be characterized as the front  of the seat  pivoting at least generally about the rear  of the seat , as illustrated by the arrows A and B in , respectively), and again this motion may be undertaken without disconnecting the seat  from the garment  in any manner which may be desirable for one or more applications (e.g., hunting).With the seat  being in the stowed position of , the front or front surface  of the seat  is moved at least generally away from the garment  to initiate deployment of the seat . Each upper strap section  extends or stretches to accommodate movement of the seat  from the stowed position of  to the intermediate of . That is, the length of each upper strap section  in  is greater than its corresponding length in the stowed position of . Again, note that the seat  remains interconnected with the garment  by the upper strap sections  and the various lower strap assemblies .In order to move the seat  from the stowed position of  to the representative deployed position of , the front  of the seat  is also moved in a downward direction. Compare the vertical position of the front  of the seat  in each of , again where  is an intermediate position of the seat  during its deployment. Movement of the seat  from the intermediate position of  to the deployed position of  entails directing the front  in a continued downward direction and then back toward a position where the seat  is now disposed underneath the garment  versus “behind” the garment  as in the case of the stowed position of . The existence of the lower strap assemblies , which again interconnect the seat  with the garment , may facilitate the above-noted type of motion for deployment of the seat  (e.g., a pivoting or pivotal-like motion of the seat  at least generally about its rear ).In the  position, the upper strap sections  may be of an intermediate length compared to the  configurations. That is, the upper strap sections  may be in an extended or stretched state in  compared to the  position ( being the stowed position), but are contracted or retracted in  (deployed position) compared to the  position (intermediate position). That is, the upper strap sections  may and preferably are in tension in the deployed position of , which desirably retains the top or upper surface  of the seat  against the user. Stated another way, the upper strap sections  preferably resiliently bias the seat  into contact with a user of the garment assembly  with the seat  being in the deployed position of .The above-described motion of the seat  during its deployment in effect inverts or flips the seat . Recall that in the  position (the stowed position), the bottom or lower surface  of the seat  faces the garment  (in a horizontal dimension), while in the  position (a representative deployed position) the bottom or lower surface  of the seat  faces away from the garment  (in a vertical dimension). Moreover, the top or upper surface  of the seat  faces away from the garment  of the garment assembly  in the stowed position of  (facing in a horizontal dimension), but faces the garment  in the deployed position of  (facing upwardly in a vertical dimension). It should be appreciated that the above-noted protocol may simply be reversed to move the seat  from a deployed position () back to the stowed position of .illustrate three representative positions for the seat , with the garment assembly  being worn by a user, and with the lower strap assemblies  being fixed at or near a lower edge  of the garment  (although again the lower strap assemblies  may be fixed or anchored at any appropriate location of the garment  as noted above, and in fact may be alleviated altogether).  is a stowed position for the seat , where the bottom or lower surface  of the seat  faces the garment , and where the top or upper surface  of the seat  faces away from the garment  (in a rearward direction in relation to the direction that the user is facing in ). At this time, the upper strap sections  may be in tension to “pull” the seat  against the back of the user, although again such is not required. Although the lower strap assemblies  are not necessarily required, they may enhance the retention of the seat  in the stowed position of .illustrates the use of a single hand to initiate the deployment of the seat  by moving the front  of the seat  both away from the garment  of the garment assembly  and in a downward direction, as illustrated by the arrow C. Both of the user's hands could of course be used. This movement of the seat  is accommodated by stretching or extending each of the upper strap sections  (i.e., the length of the upper strap sections  is increased progressing from the stowed position of  to the intermediate position of ). The movement of the seat  from the  position to the  position exposes the bottom or lower surface  of the seat  (the bottom  now facing “up” in  versus facing the back of the user in the stowed position of ), and further changes the orientation of both the top or upper surface  of the seat  and its bottom or lower surface . For instance, the top  of the seat  faces down in the intermediate position of  (in a vertical dimension), versus facing rear or away from the user in the stowed configuration of  (in a horizontal dimension).illustrates a deployed position where the user is sitting on the top or upper surface  of the seat . In order to dispose the seat  in the deployed position of  from the intermediate position of , the user manipulates the seat  to move the front  of the seat  at least generally in the direction depicted by the arrow D in , typically while still in a standing position. In the deployed position of , the upper strap sections  are preferably of an intermediate length compared to the configurations of . That is, preferably the upper strap sections  in  are longer compared to the  configuration (the stowed position for the seat ), but are shorter compared to the  configuration (an intermediate position in the deployment of the seat ). As such, the upper strap sections  will retract to at least a degree at some point in time of the movement of the seat  from the intermediate position of  to the deployed position of  (possibly when the deployed position of  is reached). In any case, the upper strap sections  are preferably in tension or stretched to a degree in the deployed position of  to “pull” the seat  against the butt of the user, although such may not be required in all instances.The garment assembly  with its deployable seat  offers a number of advantages. One is that the user does not have to “unlock” or “unlatch” any buckles to move the seat  from the stowed position (e.g., ) to a deployed position (e.g., ). Unlocking or unlatching buckles generates undesired noise for hunting applications. Stated another way, all structural connections between the seat  and the garment  of the garment assembly  may be retained or maintained while moving the seat  between its stowed position and a deployed position. Moreover, the user does not have to hold onto the seat  when moving from standing position to a position where the user is sitting on the seat , as the upper strap sections  may provide a force for retaining the seat  against the user at this time. Yet another advantage is that the user may leave the seat  in a deployed position when moving from one location to another location. That is, the user may stand up from the position illustrated in  and need not grab the seat  to do so—the upper strap sections  should retain the top or upper surface  of the seat  against the butt of the user during the user's transition from the sitting position of  to a standing position. Moreover, the seat  may be retained in a deployed position (i.e., the seat  need not be moved back to the stowed position of ) if the user is moving only a short distance—the upper strap sections  again should retain the top or upper surface  of the seat  against the butt of the user. However, if the user is going to move any significant distance, the foregoing deployment protocol may be reversed to dispose the seat  back into the stowed position of  (again, without having to disconnect the seat  from the garment  of the garment assembly  in any manner).The foregoing description of the present invention has been for purposes of illustration and description. Furthermore, the description is not intended to limit the invention to the form disclosed herein. Consequently, variations and modifications commensurate with the above teachings, and skill and knowledge of the relevant art, are within the scope of the present invention.

                "This application is a U.S. National Stage application of International Application No. PCT/AU2010/000301, filed on Mar. 15, 2010 and published on Sep. 16, 2010 as International Publication No. WO 2010/102351, which claims priority to Australian Patent Application No. 2009901069 filed on Mar. 13, 2009. The entire disclosures of these applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.The present disclosure relates generally to garments for the upper torso that include arrangements for quick release when such action is called for, for example in the event of an emergency. The present disclosure can be, for example, of particular application to load-bearing vest-type garments of a kind commonly worn by military and police personnel.Load-bearing vest-style garments are commonly worn by military and police personnel so that they may carry equipment such as tools, radios, truncheons, small weaponry, handcuffs, mace or taser devices and anti-ballistic protection panels. It can be appreciated that garments of this type therefore tend to be bulky and heavy when loaded, and may restrict the movement of the wearer. A recognized requirement can be therefore to be able to ditch these vests with minimal delay, for example, in an emergency situation such as a crash-landing helicopter or in order to be rescued from a damaged vehicle or other entrapment situation.A known approach to providing for quick release of load-bearing vest-style garments can include a separate set of rapid release linking devices in the garments. Typically, donning and securing of these garments under normal conditions can involve manual engagement of a number of Velcro (hook and loop) primary fasteners at or adjacent the waist and adjacent each shoulder. Normal doffing of the garment simply typically requires disengagement of the primary fasteners. A separate set of linking elements can be associated with either the hook or the loop component of the primary fasteners for effecting quick release of the garment from the wearer's body.For example, International Patent Publication No. WO 2008/108856 describes an anti- ballistic vest garment having a quick release mechanism. The front panel of the garment is attached to side interface panels by respective sets of interleaved loops joined by respective cables. The cables meet in end loops at the centre bottom of the garment and pass up the respective sides and along the top of the front panel. The end loops provides handles by which the wearer can simultaneously pull both cables out of the interleaved loops, whereupon the garment drops off the wearer.In the arrangement described in U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2007/0107109, a garment can be made from a number of panel components drawn together at a central location in the garment and attached using aligned eyelets, a common loop pulled through the eyelets and a single pull cord threaded through the loop. In this case, the single cord can be pulled to release multiple garment components simultaneously.These systems relying on a single draw cable may be effective in causing substantially simultaneous separation of multiple garment components and therefore the rapid release of the garment from the wearer's body. However, in many of the instances where quick release of the garment is desired, it can be equally preferred that the garment is subsequently easily and quickly reinstated to the wearer's body. Such instances can include, e.g., scrambling through a narrow opening when on patrol, escaping from a helicopter or vehicle, entering a damaged vehicle to retrieve an injured or trapped soldier, and climbing up a wall or other structure. Indeed, it may be imperative in some cases that a soldier is able to rapidly redeploy the garment in order to continue the mission, or for their own safety. The prior arrangements that rely on a single draw cable or cord extending through multiple loops or eyes in the garment cannot be easily reassembled on the wearer's body and can require a tedious process of re-threading the cable or cord through all of the loops or eyelets in the correct order.In order to more readily facilitate reassembly of a protective vest subsequent to removal, International Patent Publication No. WO 2007/146810 describes an arrangement in which one or more Velcro (hook and loop) or snap link fastener strips are arranged adjacent respective zipper/buckle fastenings. The arrangement is such that the or both fastener strips can be very quickly separated by a single motion that pulls apart the vest collars: the garment is fully opened for removal but does not drop off. In effect, this approach entails opening of the garment, rather than its complete dropping away from the body, as a compromise in order to allow more rapid re-closure.It is an object of the present disclosure to provide for quick release of a garment such as a load- bearing vest in a manner that facilitates quick redeployment of the garment.Reference to any prior art in the specification is not, and should not be taken as, an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge or that this prior art could reasonably be expected to be ascertained, understood and regarded as relevant by a person skilled in the art.Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can provide a quick release garment including:a plurality of garment panels co-operable when interconnected to form a garment in a condition wrapped about at least an upper torso of a person;a set of releasable mechanical latches, each having a first and a second portion and at least one latch element biased towards an engaged condition, releasably engageable to interconnect the garment panels to form the garment in the condition; andrelease elements carried on the garment and operable in a single operation by one hand to mechanically and substantially simultaneously release the latches by disengaging the latch element(s);where the set of releasable mechanical latches can be arranged so that the single operation allows the garment to fall from said upper torso, and where the garment is thereafter rapidly restorable to the condition wrapped about at least the upper torso from which it fell, by re-engaging each of the releasable mechanical latches by pushing the first and second portions together against the bias to re-engage the latch element(s).Advantageously, the elements carried on the garment and operable in a single operation by one hand to mechanically and substantially simultaneously release the latches includes a pull cord or cable configuration in which a single cord or cable with a hand grip at its remote end can be arranged to pull, via a multiplex coupling device, respective cables coupled to the mechanical latches.In another exemplary embodiment, the present disclosure can provide a quick release garment including:a plurality of garment panels co-operable when interconnected to form a garment in a condition wrapped about at least an upper torso of a person;a set of releasable mechanical latches releasably engageable to interconnect the garment panels to form the garment in the condition; andrelease elements carried on the garment and operable in a single operation by one hand to mechanically and substantially simultaneously release the latches, which means includes a pull cord or cable configuration in which a single cord or cable with a hand grip at its remote end can be arranged to pull, via a multiplex coupling device, respective cables coupled to the mechanical latches, whereby the garment falls from the upper torso.In either of the embodiments, each of the mechanical latches may include one or preferably two latch elements that are spring-loaded to the latching condition but withdrawable by the aforesaid cable against the spring, and a tongue element having latchable formations cooperable with the latch elements. The arrangement can be such that the tongue element may be pressed home in a fashion that pushes back the latch elements for effecting the reengagement of the releasable mechanical latches.The set of releasable mechanical latches preferably can include one such latch that when engaged interconnects two of the garment panels adjacent the upper torso below the armpits, and at least one such latch that when engaged interconnects two of the garment panels of which one extends over at least one shoulder of the upper torso. More preferably, there can be a pair of the latches below the armpits and a pair associated with garment panels that extend over the respective shoulders.Preferably, the garment includes a second set of devices for interconnecting garment panels of the plurality if garment panels, which second set are distinct from the set of releasable mechanical latches. The second set of devices for interconnecting garment panels can be selected for use in donning the garment on the normal commencement of duty involving the wearing of the garment, as distinct from occasions when the garment is to be restored to the aforesaid condition wrapped about at least the upper torso from which it is fallen, by re-engaging the releasable mechanical latches. Suitable such devices include complementary hook and loop fastener pads and extended buckles such as snap engageable/press releasable buckles.Typically, there can be garment panels among the plurality of garment panels that have one of the set of releasable mechanical latches at one location thereon, and one of the set of interconnecting devices at another location thereon.Advantageously, the quick release garment can further include elements to protect against inadvertent or accidental release of the latches. The elements to protect may be a safety catch device, whereby the hand grip is releasably attached to the garment, such that a positive release of the safety catch must occur before the hand grip can be pulled with respect to the garment, whereby the release of the safety catch and the pulling of the hand grip combined constitutes the single operation by one hand.Preferably, the multiplex coupler can be held in a fixed location relative to the garment. The pull cord preferably translates relative to the multiplex coupler. The pull cords may be covered by but not fixed to an outer sheath.The first portion can be preferably a female housing having a recess, and the second portion is preferably a male housing having a protruding tongue for releasable insertion into the recess of the first portion. The latch elements may be biased to project from within the female housing into the recess, whereby they latch within formations in the tongue of the male housing. The latch elements can be advantageously chamfered pins. The recess can be preferably covered and the latch elements can be preferably activated by chords pulling against the bias.These and other objects, features and advantages of the exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure will become apparent upon reading the following detailed description of the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.Throughout the figures, the same reference numerals and characters, unless otherwise stated, are used to denote like features, elements, components or portions of the illustrated embodiments. Moreover, while the subject disclosure will now be described in detail with reference to the figures, it is done so in connection with the illustrative embodiments. It is intended that changes and modifications can be made to the described exemplary embodiments without departing from the true scope and spirit of the subject disclosure.An exemplary embodiment of a garment illustrated in  is an exemplary embodiment of a load-bearing vest  intended to be worn about the upper torso of military or police personnel, and includes, for example, multiple flexible panels, typically fabric panels, that include inner and outer back layers , , and inner and outer front layers , , that can be interconnected and able to be assembled together about the upper torso of a wearer by means of a pair of side waistband assemblies  and a pair of shoulder strap assemblies . In each case the back and front inner and outer layers match and can be assembled together by stitching or the like to define an interior space. The outer layers typically can exhibit camouflage colors on their outside and can normally carry a variety of open pockets, zippered pockets, tie straps and the like by which the wearer can carry a selection of devices, tools and weapons according to the requirements of the day.The side waistband assemblies  and the shoulder strap assemblies  can incorporate two different sets of devices for interconnecting the back and front panels. At each assembly, there can be, firstly, a conveniently engageable and releasable fastening device for use when “normally” donning the garment or doffing it at the conclusion of an operation, and, secondly, a mechanical latch that is releasable, by means to be discussed, to achieve quick release of the garment in an emergency. In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, several releasable mechanical latches can be substantially simultaneously released.Each side waistband assembly  can have an inner elongate waistband panel , , and an outer side panel ,  of a profile nearer to square. On the inner face, at the front end of each waistband panel , , can be affixed one of the cooperating pads  of a hook and loop fastener, the other pad  can be disposed on the outside face of front panel . Fitted to the other or rear end of the waistband panels , , and firmly sandwiched between the waistband panels ,  and the respective side panel , , can be a first component, tongue  of a mechanical latch .Similarly, as shown in , each shoulder strap assembly  can have a shoulder strap panel ,  that in situ lies over the wearer's shoulder and can be fastened to the front panel by an outside strap and buckle . At the rear end, behind the shoulderIn situ, can be fitted a tongue component similar to the tongue components  of the waistband panels , . Firmly secured within the interior space formed between inner and outer back layers ,  can be the four second components, female components , of the mechanical latches  of which tongue components , form the complementary male part. Each of these female components ,can have a rectangular two-part housing , with a base  (see ), a cover  and a central rectangular recess  at a front edge. This recess  can receive a projecting tongue  of rectangular shape matching the recess: tongue  can be formed integrally with a cross piece  of tongue component , The cross piece  can be of a u-shaped side cross section (see ) to define a slot  to receive the respective fabric of the garment panel to which it is secured by spaced fasteners in countersunk apertures .Recess  can have a pair of slidable latch elements, pins  located in slots  in opposed positions to either side of the recess. Latch pins  can be biased to their forward condition protruding into recess  by a shaped spring-steel spring  that can embrace the latch pins and bias them towards each other. Latch pins  further can have forward chamfered faces  (see ) by which tongue  can push back the latch pins as the tongue enters the recess, and respective rearward faces  that engage a back edge  of a rectangular transverse bore  in tongue . Bore  can be dimensioned to slidably receive the two latch pins at its respective ends. Spring  can ensure that the two latch pins snap into place in this transverse bore  once tongue  is far enough into the recess . It can be appreciated that the latch pins  may be located on the tongue component  and be biased outwardly into apertures in the female component .e A plurality of (e.g. four) mechanical latches  - two at or above the waist line below the armpits and two at the rear of the shoulders - can be substantially simultaneously releasable at will by a hand-operated cable mechanism  of the bowden cable type. A primary cable  can have a hand-grip  by which the cable can be actuable, by being pulled, to in turn activate each of four secondary cables  coupled to the respective female components  of the latches . This transfer of the hand tug on the primary cable can be via a mechanical multiplex coupler , which can be fastened to the vest. Each of the cables , can have an external sheath  and an internal wire The sheaths can be fixed, to prevent their translation, to the housings  of the latches , to the housing  of the multiplex coupler  and, in the case of the primary cable , via a sheath lock (including base and cover ) to a fabric outer sheath  fastened at its rear end to a top edge portion of the back panels , . The sheaths can protect the cables and allow the cables to move even though the garment may be squashed against a surface. Housings  and  are in turn fastened to the back panels , . Handgrip  can be a two-part housing ,  of tear-drop shape with an internal wire channel  terminating at an enlarged end  to locate a bulb  on the end of primary cable wireEach of the five wires can have an end piece  of cylindrical form that can be held in a matching aperture  () of an internal slide  within the housing  of multiplex coupler . Housing  can include a base and a cover Drawing the wire of primary cable  relative to its sheath can pull the slide  forward in its housing  and thereby in turn tug on the wires of the secondary cables.  illustrates how, within the housings  of mechanical latches , the respective wire can be forked into two branch wires that can be led about pulleys , to be retained by terminal endpieces  in matching apertures  in the latch pins .In a modification or another exemplary embodiment (see ), pulleys  can be dispensed with and the cable branch wires can be guided to latch pins ′ by suitably profiled internal integral guide walls ′. The latch pins ′ can be shown in the two positions, one biased into recess  and bore , the other withdrawn. The housing in this embodiment can provide protection over the recess to seal against dust entering and locking up the latch pins ′.For example, the cable mechanism  can be pre-dimensioned accurately so that the arrangement can be operable in a single operation, by one hand drawing on handgrip , to mechanically and substantially simultaneously release latches . Because this release of the latches can wholly separate the garment into two segments—the assembly of the back panels ,  with the built in cable and latch configuration and the front panels ,  still attached to the waist band panels, side panels and shoulder strap panels - this single operation by one hand can be effective to allow the garment to fall from the torso on which it is worn, thus achieving the requirement for quick release of the garment.When the wearer has carried out the action which necessitated quick removal of the garment (e.g., perhaps pulled a colleague from a damaged vehicle or otherwise out of harm's way, crawled through a narrow opening, or cleared an obstacle) the garment can thereafter be rapidly restorable to its condition wrapped about the wearer's upper torso from which it fell by draping the two separated sections in position and rapidly one-by-one re-engaging the mechanical latches by pushing the respective tongue components  home into the recesses  of the female components . One way in which this might be best achieved would be, e.g., to first fasten the shoulder latches and then drop the garment onto the shoulders about the wearer's head before fastening the side latches.depict an exemplary embodiment of a modified cable hand grip ′ fitted with a safety catch device  to prevent inadvertent or accidental release of the vest. A primary cable wire ′ can be retained as before by locating a bulb ′ at the end of the wire in an enlarged end ′ of a wire channel ′. However, in this exemplary case, the hand grip ′ can be normally immovably retained on the garment by means of a stud  sewn at its base into the garment (represented at  in ) and having a cylindrical head  that protrudes into but not through the interior of the hand grip and has an enlarged end .A slide  can be linearly moveable in a guideway  defined by internal ribs . Stud head  can protrude into the centre of the guideway  and slide  can have two apertures: a first aperture that snugly embraces stud head  but can be smaller than stud end , and a second adjacent aperture A neck  between apertures can be deformable or compressible to allow the stud head to move relatively between the apertures. When stud  protrudes through aperture preferably, hand grip ′ cannot be lifted off the stud, to permit operation of the cable release mechanism; when the stud protrudes through aperture there is preferably no such restraint.Slide  can be biased, by a spring steel clip , to the position in which stud  can be in aperture and the outer end of the slide can protrude from housing ′ as a push “button” . The wearer who wishes to operate the quick release mechanism preferably executes, in one operation, through two actions, e.g.: firstly press in the “button” , which positions stud  in aperture and then simultaneously lift the hand grip housing ′ off the garment and pull it down to operate the cable mechanism  to release the mechanical latches  as in the embodiment of ,  and .It can be understood that the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure disclosed, described and defined in this specification extends to all alternative combinations of two or more of the individual features mentioned or evident from the text or drawings. All of these different combinations constitute various alternative aspects of the present disclosure."

                "1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a glove having excellent moisture permeability and abrasion resistance of a back portion, and more specifically, to a glove which, by forming a coating layer having excellent moisture permeability and abrasion resistance on a back portion which tends to be damaged due to rubbing or scratching, does not bring about heat trapped and a steamy condition in a glove to provide an excellent feel when wearing and can further protect the back portion from breakages due to rubbing or scratching or from perforations or damages due to sparks generated in a metal cutting work, and a method of producing the same.2. Description of the Related ArtHitherto, as the gloves of this kind, a glove in which a coating layer is provided by sticking or sewing a synthetic leather to a palm portion of a glove made of fibers, and a glove, in which a palm portion is covered with resin or rubber and a back portion is not provided with these coating layers to secure air permeability of a base material made of fibers, are used.For example, in a glove for sporting in which a palm portion is composed of a natural leather or a synthetic leather and the whole back of the hand including finger bags is composed of a fabric, a glove for sporting, in which the whole back of the hand including finger bags in a glove main body is configured so as to be a two-layered structure in which a chemical fiber fabric is disposed on an inner side and a cotton fabric is disposed on an outer side, is proposed (for example, JP-A-11-290497).Further, a slip resistant glove in which a foam layer composed of a thermoplastic resin or rubber is formed on the glove base material made of fibers and the surface of the foam layer has a projection and depression shape, in which the foam layer is mechanically foamed and hot pressed in a semi-crosslinked or gelled state to be provided with projections and depressions on the surface, and a depression portion of the foam layer is compressed in such a way that an air bubble content is 10 to 90% by volume with respect to that of a projection portion, and many openings being the impressions of air bubbles are formed at the surface of the projection portion, is proposed (for example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 4242338).Furthermore, a working glove is proposed which is characterized in that a slip resistant coating is formed by coating the surface of a glove main body formed by sewing leather as a material with a synthetic rubber and the synthetic rubber is a copolymer of butadiene and styrene or a copolymer of butadiene and acrylonitrile, which is excellent in oil resistance, acid resistance and alkali resistance (for example, JP-A-7-278923).However, since the whole back portion of the glove described in JP-A-11-290497 is composed of fabric, the glove has a problem that the glove is inferior in abrasion resistance and a back portion, which easily causes breakages due to rubbing or scratching, particularly fingertips and portions from the fingertips to the first joints, the second joints and the third joints (joints between fingers and backs, the same applies hereinafter) is apt to cause straggling or breakages in fibers due to rubbing or scratching. Furthermore, the gloves have a problem that the back portion of the glove is readily perforated, for example, due to sparks generated in a metal cutting work because of low strength so that they cannot play a role of protection.Further, the glove described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 4242338 mainly aims at a slip resistant effect, and therefore in gloves shown in examples, a foam layer is provided for only a palm portion which is brought into contact with an object when gripping the object. Thus, the back portion of the glove is still composed of a base material made of fibers in these examples, and therefore, the glove is inferior in abrasion resistance, and has problems that as with the gloves in JP-A-11-290497, the back portion is apt to cause straggling or breakages, and is readily perforated or damaged, for example, due to sparks generated in a metal cutting work because of low strength and cannot play a role of protection. In addition, particularly, the moisture permeability or abrasion resistance of a foam layer of the back portion is not considered at all, and furthermore, any contrivance concerning fingertips, the first joints, the second joints and the third joints of the back portion which easily causes breakages due to rubbing or scratching of the back portion is not considered at all.Moreover, in the glove described in JP-A-7-278923, since the surface of the glove is coated with a synthetic rubber, some of the above-mentioned problems are solved, but abrasion resistance is not necessarily sufficient. Further, since the whole area of the glove is coated with a nonpermeable coating layer of a synthetic rubber, the glove has a problem that heat is trapped in the glove, and a steamy feel is large to provide a bad feel when using it due to the lack of moisture permeability.In view of the above state of the art, it is an object of the present invention to provide a glove which solves the above-mentioned problems of conventional techniques, has excellent moisture permeability and an excellent feel when wearing, and has excellent abrasion resistance of a back portion.The present invention was made in order to solve the above-mentioned problems, and is characterized by the following items.(1) A glove provided with a coating layer of rubber containing air bubbles formed at least on the surface of a back portion of a glove base material made of fibers, wherein the moisture permeability of the coating layer of the back portion ranges from 1000 to 9000 g/m·24 hrs in terms of a measured value according to JIS L 1099 A-1 method (calcium chloride method) and the wear loss of the coating layer of the back portion is 40 mg or less in terms of a value measured after 100 revolutions by use of a tester, Nu-Martindale Abrasion and Pilling Tester, specified by EN ISO 12947-1, according to the European Standard EN 388; 2003.(2) The glove according to (1), wherein the average air bubble content of the coating layer is 12 to 85%.(3) The glove according to (1), wherein the wear losses of the nail portions of the coating layer and of the first joint portions, the second joint portions and the third joint portions of fingers of the coating layer are respectively 7 mg or less in terms of values measured after 100 revolutions by use of a tester, Nu-Martindale Abrasion and Pilling Tester, specified by EN ISO 12947-1, according to the European Standard EN 388; 2003.(4) The glove according to (3), wherein the average air bubble contents of the nail portions, the first joint portions, the second joint portions and the third joint portions of the coating layer are respectively 0 to 10%.(5) The glove according to any one of (1) to (4), wherein a face fastener is provided to a hem portion of a rubber coating layer of the glove.(6) A method for producing a glove, which comprises the steps of;forming a coating layer having the average air bubble content of 22 to 89% at least on the surface of a back portion of a glove base material made of fibers by use of a rubber blended solution having the average air bubble content of 7 to 88% by volume, andhot pressing the coating layer in such a way that the average air bubble content of the coating layer is 12 to 85%.(7) The method for producing a glove according to (6), wherein a water content of the coating layer having the average air bubble content of 22 to 89% is adjusted to 20 to 170% by weight and then the coating layer is hot pressed.(8) The method for producing a glove according to (6) or (7), wherein the coating layer is hot pressed by use of a pressing plate having a projection and depression pattern.(9) The method for producing a glove according to (6) or (7), wherein the coating layer is hot pressed by use of a pressing plate not having a projection and depression pattern.(10) The method of producing a glove according to any one of (6) to (9), wherein a face fastener is attached to a hem portion of a rubber coating layer.Since the glove of the present invention is provided with a coating layer which is composed of rubber containing air bubbles and formed at least on a back portion, it has good moisture permeability and abrasion resistance of a back portion, does not bring about heat trapped and a steamy condition in glove to provide an excellent feel when wearing, hardly cause breakages due to rubbing or scratching and is hardly perforated, for example, due to sparks generated in a metal cutting work and is superior in protection performance.The glove of the present invention is characterized in that a coating layer of rubber containing air bubbles is formed at least on the surface of a back portion of a glove base material made of fibers, the moisture permeability of the coating layer of the back portion ranges from 1000 to 9000 g/m·24 hrs in terms of a measured value according to JIS L 1099 A-1 method (calcium chloride method), and the wear loss of the coating layer of the back portion is 40 mg or less in terms of a value measured after 100 revolutions by use of a tester, Nu-Martindale Abrasion and Pilling Tester, specified by EN ISO 12947-1, according to the European Standard EN 388; 2003.The glove of the present invention requires that the moisture permeability of the coating layer of the back portion ranges from 1000 to 9000 g/m·24 hrs in terms of a measured value according to JIS L 1099 A-1 method (calcium chloride method). When the moisture permeability is less than 1000 g/m·24 hrs, the moisture permeability of the coating layer is insufficient and heat trapped and a steamy condition in a glove are not adequately solved, and on the other hand, when the moisture permeability is more than 9000 g/m·24 hrs, the abrasion resistance of the coating layer is insufficient.Further, the glove of the present invention requires that the wear loss of the coating layer of the back portion is 40 mg or less in terms of a value measured after 100 revolutions by use of a tester, Nu-Martindale Abrasion and Pilling Tester, specified by EN ISO 12947-1, according to the European Standard EN 388; 2003. When the wear loss is more than 40 mg, the abrasion resistance of the coating layer is insufficient and breakage of the coating layer due to rubbing or scratching cannot be adequately prevented.In order to achieve the above-mentioned moisture permeability and abrasion resistance of the coating layer, it is preferable that the average air bubble content of the coating layer is 12 to 85%. When the average air bubble content of the coating layer is less than the above range, moisture permeability tends to be insufficient, and on the other hand, when the average air bubble content is more than the above range, abrasion resistance tends to be insufficient.It is preferred that of the coating layer of the back portion, particularly, nail portions, the first joint portions, the second joint portions and the third joint portions of fingers, which easily cause breakages due to rubbing or scratching, have a wear loss of 7 mg or less. By keeping the wear losses of these portions below 7 mg, these portions further hardly cause breakage even though these portions are brought into contact with metal portions, etc., rubbed or scratched during works, and can further prevent a trouble that these portions are perforated due to sparks generated in metal cutting works, and therefore, gloves having even more excellent protection performance can be attained.The average air bubble contents of the coating layers of these portions are preferably 0 to 10%.It is preferred that the glove base material made of fibers used in the present invention is made by use of natural fibers or chemical fibers, such as cotton, wool, polyester, polyamide (nylon), acryl, aramide, reinforced polyethylene or the like; and that a stretching rate per a unit area of the glove base material made of fibers is usually about 150 to 650%. The stretching rate is the maximum enlarging rate at the time when simultaneously stretching the base material longitudinally and laterally. If the stretching rate of the glove base material made of fibers is small, wrinkles, particularly, deep wrinkles in a palm and a thumb, occur in a product prepared after the glove base material made of fibers is released from a hand mold for immersion and put on a hand mold for setting used in hot pressing, and cured (vulcanized), and further cracks often occur on a coating layer. Moreover, a knitted or sewed glove base material containing polyurethane elastic fibers in which the stretching rate is imparted to fibers is also used. The glove base material made of fibers is dyed or purified as required.Examples of the rubber used in the present invention include natural rubber, homopolymers or copolymers such as isoprene, chloroprene, acrylic ester rubber, styrene-butadiene copolymers, acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers, polyurethane, butyl rubber, polybutadiene rubber and silicone rubber, copolymers containing 10% by weight or less of a carboxyl-modified group, and those blended with the copolymers. The term, natural rubber includes not only natural rubber alone, but also a natural rubber-methylmethacrylate copolymer, epoxy-modified natural rubber copolymer, and the like. The term, acrylic ester rubber includes homopolymers or copolymers such as n-butyl acrylate, n-butyl methacrylate, iso-butyl acrylate, iso-butyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, iso-propyl acrylate and iso-propyl methacrylate, which contain acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, allyl methacrylate, N-methylol acrylamide, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, or the like.Generally, a crosslinking agent, a vulcanization accelerator, an antioxidant, a thickener or the like, and a foaming agent or a foam stabilizer is added to the rubber.Examples of the foaming agent include sodium sulfosuccinate based surfactants, alkylmonoamide disodium sulfosuccinate, potassium oleate, castor oil potassium, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, and the like, and these are used singly or in combination of two or more.Examples of the foam stabilizer include ammoniumstearate, peptide, sodium alkyldipropionate, and the like, and these are used singly or in combination of two or more. Alkyl includes lauryl, octyl, stearyl, and the like.Further, as an air bubble stabilizer for a coating layer, if 15 to 50 parts by weight of 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediolmonoisobutylate is added to 100 parts by weight of rubber, processability is improved and thus preferable.To the above rubber, known chemical foaming agents, such as toluenesulfonyl hydrazide, pp'oxybis(benzosulfonyl hydrazide), azodicarbonamide and azobisisobutylonitrile, or microcapsules may be further added to reduce the number of open holes for the purpose of preventing absorption of oils or chemicals to the surface of the coating layer. Moreover, particles of acryl, urethane, natural rubber powder, EVA powder, PVC, or NBR may be further added in order to increase a solid content to enhance abrasion resistance.The glove of the present invention can be prepared by forming a rubber coating layer including air bubbles at least on a back portion of a glove base material made of fibers by use of a rubber blended solution including air bubbles, then hot pressing the coating layer.A preferable production method will be described. First, a glove base material made of fibers is put on a hand mold for immersion. As the hand mold for immersion, a ceramic hand mold, an aluminum alloy hand mold or the like are suitably used, and a hand mold having a configuration, in which fingers from a thumb to a little finger are arranged linearly, is preferable. The glove base material made of fibers is put on the hand mold for immersion preheated to 50 to 70° C., and immersed in, for example, methanol containing calcium nitrate or a warm water bath of a coagulant solution, adjusted to 50 to 70° C., which contains calcium nitrate. The content of the coagulant is preferably adjusted in such a way that a rubber blended solution partially penetrates into the glove base material made of fibers in order to avoid the deterioration of touch feeling.The immersed hand mold with the glove base material made of fibers put thereon, which has been immersed in the warm water bath of a coagulant solution, is immersed in a bath of a rubber blended solution including air bubbles. In immersion, generally, a method of immersing a glove vertically from a fingertip to a wrist is adopted.The blended solution is mechanically foamed with a bubbling machine or a mixer. The average air bubble content of the blended solution is preferably adjusted to 7 to 88% by volume. Thereby, gloves having excellent moisture permeability and abrasion resistance, in which the desired moisture permeability of a coating layer is 1000 to 9000 g/m·24 hrs and the desired wear loss of a coating layer is 40 mg or less, are obtained.The average air bubble content (% by volume) of the blended solution is determined by the following method.When A ml of a blended solution without including air bubbles is stirred with a bubbling machine or a mixer to include air to obtain B ml of a blended solution including air bubbles, the average air bubble content is calculated from the following equation;[(ml−ml)/ml]×100Further, the average air bubble diameter of the blended solution is preferably 10 to 200 μm, more preferably 10 to 100 μm. The average air bubble diameter of 10 to 200 μm in the blended solution increases when a coating layer is formed and hot pressed, and therefore, the average air bubble diameter of the coating layer becomes approximately 30 to 400 μm. The average air bubble diameter of the coating layer is important for design, and when the average air bubble diameter is more than 400 μm, the design tends to be impaired. Accordingly, an upper limit of the average air bubble diameter of the blended solution is preferably approximately 200 μm. On the other hand, when the average air bubble diameter of the blended solution is less than 10 μm, adjustment is difficult even if mechanical shear is exerted. The blended solution having the average air bubble diameter of 10 to 200 μm can be obtained by exerting shear on the blended solution with a high-speed mixer of about 600 to 1200 rpm or a bubbling machine.The average air bubble diameter (μm) of the blended solution is measured by the following method.10 g of a blended solution is put in a petri dish, and observed with a microscope VHX-900 (manufactured by KEYENCE Corp.). In images taken at 200 times magnification, ten diameters of five air bubbles selected in decreasing order of bubble diameter from the largest bubble diameter and five air bubbles selected in increasing order of bubble diameter from the smallest bubble diameter are measured in an image of 2000 μm×2000 μm, and an average of the ten diameters is calculated.The glove immersed in the bath of a rubber blended solution including air bubbles is pull out from the blended solution, and then is dried at 60 to 95° C. by heating to be semi-cured (semi-gelled). The average air bubble content of the semi-cured coating layer is 22 to 89%. This average air bubble content can be adjusted by the concentration of solid matter of the blended solution and the viscosity of the blended solution, or a foam stabilizer. Thereafter, generally, the glove is leached by water washing and hot pressed. By hot pressing, a part of the air bubbles in the coating layer is crushed and the air bubbles are communicated with one another to increase the moisture permeability, and walls forming air bubbles are melted to one another to decrease the air bubble content to increase the abrasion resistance. The coating layer can be beautifully hot pressed by adjusting the water content of the coating layer before hot pressing to 20 to 170% by weight, and particularly, when the coating layer is provided with a projection and depression pattern through hot pressing, the projection and depression pattern can be beautifully formed.The water content (% by weight) in the coating layer before hot pressing is calculated from the following equation.[(weight () of a glove after leaching−weight () of a glove before leaching)/weight () of a glove before leaching]×100Hot pressing is carried out under the conditions of a pressing temperature of 60 to 300° C. and a pressing time of 1 to 180 seconds with a pressing pressure of 1 to 100 kgf/cmapplied to the glove put on a hand mold for immersion and provided with a coating layer from a back side or both of a back side and a palm side of the glove with a pressing plate. In this case, a projection and depression pattern can be formed on a back side of the glove or on both of a back side and a palm side, as required.When the projection and depression pattern is formed, a pressing plate having a projection and depression pattern (hereinafter, referred to as a projection and depression plate) is used.When the projection and depression pattern is formed on only the back side, the projection and depression plate is used for the pressing plate on the back side and a pressing plate without having a projection and depression pattern (hereinafter, referred to as a projection plate) is used for the pressing plate on the palm side. Further, when the projection and depression pattern is used on both of the back side and the palm side, the projection and depression plate is used for both of the back side and the palm side.As another method, the glove in which a coating layer is formed is removed from the hand mold for immersion, put on a flat mold again, and hot pressed as with the above method. Further, when hot pressing is carried out from both of the back side and the palm side of the glove, pressing can be performed at a uniform pressure by using a female mold composed of a projection and depression plate or a projection plate prepared in conformity with the configuration of the hand mold for immersion. In this case, hot pressing can be applied up to a side of the glove, and when the female mold composed of a projection and depression plate is used, a projection and depression pattern is beautifully formed up to a side of the glove.The depth of projection and depression (difference in level between the projection and the depression) of the projection and depression plate is preferably in a range from about 0.1 mm to about 1.2 mm, and more preferably about 0.3 mm to about 1.0 mm from the viewpoint of a grip force and design. The depth of the projection plate without having a projection and depression pattern is the same as above. By adjusting the depth of projection and depression of the projection and depression plate or the depth of the projection plate within the above range, abrasion resistance and moisture permeability can be adjusted to a desired range. A shape of the projection and depression pattern of the projection and depression plate is not particularly limited, and examples of the shape include a variety of geometric patterns such as a circle, a shape of an ellipse, a rectangle, a polygonal shape, and the like, and indefinite patterns (See ), and when these are arranged regularly or irregularly, not only abrasion resistance is improved, but also a grip force is improved and design is enhanced.The coating layer is hot pressed so that its average air bubble content is 12 to 85%. When the average air bubble content is less than 12%, moisture permeability is insufficient, and when the average air bubble content is more than 85%, abrasion resistance is insufficient, and therefore it becomes difficult to obtain a coating layer in which the desired moisture permeability is 1000 to 9000 g/m·24 hrs and the desired wear loss is 40 mg or less.For decreasing the average air bubble content of the coating layer, methods in which the depth of the projection and depression plate or the projection plate is increased, and an area of a projection portion is increased, and when the projection and depression plate is used, methods in which a time of hot pressing is increased, or hot pressing is repeated twice or more are employed, and for increasing the average air bubble content of the coating layer, methods contrary to the above methods are employed.The average air bubble content (%) of the coating layer before or after pressing is determined by the following method.As shown in , a point of intersection of a line α, which extends from a finger crotch between a thumb and an index finger and is parallel to a line β connecting a finger crotch between an index finger and a middle finger to a finger crotch between a third finger and a little finger, and a line γ connecting a middle finger tip and a center of a wrist is taken as a point a, and a point 1 cm upward and a point 1 cm downward from the point a on the line γ are taken as b and c, respectively, and a point 1 cm leftward and a point 1 cm rightward from the point a on the line α are taken as d and e, respectively. Images of cross-sections of the coating layers, indicated by lines b-c and d-e, which are taken at 200 times magnification by a microscope VHX-900 (manufactured by KEYENCE Corp.), are obtained, and an average ratio of areas of air bubbles in a division of 300 μm×300 μm of the images is calculated from the following equation.[Total air bubble area (μm)/90000 μm]×100Particularly, the nail portions, and the first joint portions, the second joint portions and the third joint portions of fingers, which easily cause the wear or the abrasion of the back portion, are preferably pressed as required in such a way that the average air bubble content of the coating layer is 0 to 10%. Thereby, a glove, in which a wear loss is 7 mg or less and abrasion resistance is locally improved, is obtained. The glove, in which abrasion resistance is improved as described above, further hardly causes breakage due to rubbing or scratching during a work, and further hardly causes a trouble that the back portions of the glove is perforated even in a work where sparks fly about such as in a metal cutting work, and therefore, a glove having extremely excellent protection performance can be provided. In addition, when the average air bubble content of the coating layer is 0 to 10% locally, the moisture permeability is reduced to about 100 to 500 g/m·24 hrs at such portions, but since the moisture permeability of other portions is 1000 to 9000 g/m·24 hrs, the moisture permeability of the whole back portion is sufficient and this does not bring about a problem practically.In order to keep the average air bubble contents of the nail portions of the coating layer, and the first joint portions, the second joint portions and the third joint portions of fingers of the coating layer in a range of 0 to 10%, a method, in which a depth of a projection and depression plate or a projection plate for these portions is made to be larger than that of other portions or areas of projections for the projection and depression plate are increased, is preferable because hot pressing only have to be carried out once. However, by carrying out the hot pressing twice or more, the average air bubble contents of these portions can also be adjusted.The average air bubble contents of the nail portions of the coating layer, and the first joint portions, the second joint portions and the third joint portions of fingers of the coating layer are calculated by the following method.As shown in , images of cross-sections of the coating layers of a nail portion A of a middle finger, a first joint B of a thumb, a second joint C of a middle finger, a second joint C of a little finger and a third joint D of a middle finger, which are taken at 200 times magnification by a microscope VI-DC-900 (manufactured by KEYENCE Corp.), are obtained, and an average ratio (%) of areas of air bubbles in a division of 300 μm×300 μM of the images is calculated from the following equation.[Total air bubble area (μm)/90000 μm]×100In addition, since the nail portions and the joint portions vary with a glove size and a hand size of wearer, it is preferred that the gloves are previously adjusted according to a small size (S), a middle size (M), a large size (L) or an oversize (LL), or a little broader area is hot pressed so that the coating layer can be applied regardless of whether a size is large or small.The glove is released from the hand mold, and then put on a hand mold for setting having a configuration close to a human hand, in which a thumb is located on an inner side, cured at 120 to 130° C. for 40 to 60 minutes and released from the hand mold.A hem portion (wrist portion) of the released glove is cut as required for preventing slippage, for example, and a part such as a face fastener (hook-and-loop fastener) is sewed to be finished.Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail by way of examples and comparative examples, but the present invention is not limited to these examples and comparative examples.In addition, the average air bubble content of a blended solution, the water content of a coating layer, the average air bubble content of the coating layer, and the moisture permeability and the wear loss of the coating layer were measured by the methods described above.The wear loss was measured by a method of using a tester, Nu-Martindale, described above, and in the present invention, a jig shown in  was used as a jig for fastening a test piece in order to measure the wear losses of nail portions or local portions in joint portions. A unit of figures in  is a millimeter.Further, the steamy feel was evaluated based on the presence or absence of a steamy feel in wearing the gloves actually. The perforation was evaluated by placing the glove so as to be hit by sparks generated in cutting an equal-angle steel and observing the surface of a coating layer of the glove with the naked eye after cutting the steel.The above-mentioned rubber blended solution was stirred so as to include air by an automatic handheld mixer for home use to prepare a blended solution in which an average air bubble content is 33% by volume (average air bubble diameter 30 μm).A knitted glove (280 d) made of wooly nylon was put on a hand mold for immersion, in which fingers from a thumb to a little finger are arranged linearly, and immersed in a 0.7 weight % methanol coagulating solution of calcium nitrate, and then the glove was immersed vertically in the blended solution including air bubbles from a fingertip to a wrist, and thereafter, the glove was dried at 75° C. for 10 minutes to be semi-cured (semi-gelled) and released from the hand mold. The average thickness of the coating layer was 0.7 mm. The released glove was leached by water washing, and the water content of the coating layer was adjusted to 50% by weight, and then the glove was put on the flat mold again and hot pressed.As a hot pressing plate, a projection and depression plate having an indefinite projection and depression pattern (depth is 0.7 mm and a ratio of a projection area to a depression area per 1 cmis 8/3) shown in ) and () (cross-cut in ) represents a dimension and one side of a cross-cut indicates 1 mm) on a back side and a palm side of the glove was used, and the glove was hot pressed at a pressure of 1 kgf/cmat 180° C. for 5 seconds.The hot pressed glove was put on a hand mold for setting (a hand mold close to a human hand, in which a thumb is located at a position shifted to a palm side) again, cured at 120° C. for 60 minutes and released from the hand mold to obtain a glove in which a coating layer including air bubbles was formed on both sides of a palm portion and a back portion.A summary of production conditions and the results of evaluation of properties are shown in Table 1.A glove, in which a coating layer including air bubbles was formed on both sides of a palm portion and a back portion, was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except for changing the average air bubble content of the blended solution from 33% by volume to 88% by volume.A summary of production conditions and the results of evaluation of properties are shown in Table 1.A glove was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except for changing the hot pressing plate from the projection and depression plate having a projection and depression pattern to a projection plate (depth is 0.7 mm) without having a projection and depression pattern.A summary of production conditions and the results of evaluation of properties are shown in Table 1.A glove was prepared in the same manner as in Example 2 except for changing the hot pressing plate from the projection and depression plate having a projection and depression pattern to a projection plate (depth is 0.7 mm) without having a projection and depression pattern.A summary of production conditions and the results of evaluation of properties are shown in Table 1.A glove was dried, leached, hot pressed with a projection and depression plate, and cured in the same manner as in Example 1 except that only the palm portion of the knitted glove made of wooly nylon was immersed in the blended solution to prepare a glove in which a coating layer including air bubbles was formed on only a palm portion.A summary of production conditions and the results of evaluation of properties are shown in Table 1.A glove, in which a coating layer including air bubbles is formed on both sides of a palm portion and a back portion, was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except for changing the average air bubble content of the blended solution from 33% by volume to 3.5% by volume.A summary of production conditions and the results of evaluation of properties are shown in Table 1.A glove, in which a coating layer including air bubbles was formed on both sides of a palm portion and a back portion, was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except for changing the average air bubble content of the blended solution from 33% by volume to 103% by volume.A summary of production conditions and the results of evaluation of properties are shown in Table 1.A glove, in which a coating layer including air bubbles was formed on both sides of a palm portion and a back portion, was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except for changing the average air bubble content of the blended solution from 33% by volume to 3.5% by volume and changing the hot pressing plate from the indefinite projection and depression plate to a projection plate.A summary of production conditions and the results of evaluation of properties are shown in Table 1.A glove, in which a coating layer including air bubbles was formed on both sides of a palm portion and a back portion, was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except for changing the average air bubble content of the blended solution from 33% by volume to 103% by volume and changing the hot pressing plate from the indefinite projection and depression plate to a projection plate.A summary of production conditions and the results of evaluation of properties are shown in Table 1.The glove obtained in Example 1, in which a coating layer including air bubbles was formed on both sides of a palm portion and a back portion, was put on a flat mold, and nail portions, and the first joint portions, the second joint portions and the third joint portions of the coating layer of a back portion were locally hot pressed again with a projection plate (depth is 0.7 mm).A summary of production conditions and the results of evaluation of properties are shown in Table 2.The glove obtained in Example 2, in which a coating layer including air bubbles was formed on both sides of a palm portion and a back portion, was put on a flat pattern, and nail portions, and the first joint portions, the second joint portions and the third joint portions of the coating layer of a back portion were locally hot pressed again with a projection plate (depth is 0.7 mm).A summary of production conditions and the results of evaluation of properties are shown in Table 2.It is apparent from the results shown in Table 1 that the gloves of the present invention represented by the gloves in Examples 1 to 4 have no steamy feel because of excellent moisture permeability of a back portion, and are not perforated due to sparks generated in a metal cutting work because of excellent abrasion resistance and is superior in protection performance.Further, it is apparent from the results shown in Table 2 that by locally hot pressing nail portions, and the first joint portions, the second joint portions and the third joint portions of a back portion of the gloves of the present invention, the abrasion resistance of these portions is further enhanced, and gloves having a further excellent protection performance are obtained even under further severe working conditions.A hem of the glove obtained in Example 1 was laterally cut at a position about 190 cm from a tip of a middle finger (position indicated by T in ).Next, on the cut hem portion, a knitted rubber (40 mm in width) W was sewed with threads (manufactured by FUJIX Ltd., polyester spun thread No. 60 yarn number count) using a zigzag stitch sewing machine (manufactured by Brother Industries, Ltd., model LZ2-B856E-301).Next, a slit C of about 40 mm in length was vertically cut in a side on a little finger side. Then, a face fastener (hook-like male: 30×60 mm, loop(pile)-like female: 30×50 mm) was prepared. The male portion F of the face fastener was bordered with a bias tape (15 mm×120 mm) in advance. In bordering, the bias tape was sewed by a sewing machine (MITSUBISHI LY2-3300 manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric Corp.) using threads (manufactured by COATS PLC, 45 tex, Nylon Thread Yarn Wine 916PQ). This bordered male portion F of the face fastener was sewed on a side closer to a little finger of the above slit C by straight stitch, and the female portion F of the face fastener was sewed similarly on a portion of the knitted rubber W corresponding to the male portion F of the face fastener. Finally, the edge of the slit C was bordered with a bias tape to obtain a glove preventing slippage.Since the rubber coating layer is formed on the glove made of fibers (knitted gloves), there is no straggling of the glove made of fibers in cutting the glove, and therefore the step of preventing straggling is unnecessary and workability is extremely good.In addition, it is needless to say that there is no problem if the male portion F and the female portion F of the face fastener change places in the present example.In accordance with the present invention, since a coating layer composed of rubber containing air bubbles is formed at least on a back portion of a glove, it is possible to provide a glove which has good moisture permeability and abrasion resistance of the back portion, does not cause heat trapped and a steamy condition in glove to provide an excellent feel when wearing, can protect the back portion from breakages due to rubbing or scratching and protect from perforations or damages due to sparks generated in a metal cutting work and is superior in protection performance."

                "This invention relates to apparel, specifically, the invention concerns headwear, such as a baseball cap or hat designed to keep sunlight, rain, and possibly perspiration out of a wearer's eyes. A standard baseball cap design includes a visor over the eyes and a crown over the head. There are many variations of this arrangement utilizing many different materials with “fitted” and “adjustable” designs. In particular, this invention relates to a design, herein called an “Air Cap,” that creates a cooling flow of air over a wearer's head. All other patent design variations will work with the Air Cap design addition.Baseball caps were originally invented as athletic equipment for baseball players to keep sunlight, rain, and perspiration out of their eyes. Since then they have achieved a large popularity in other sports and the general population. There are many designs and variations to allow adjusting the size, moving the visor, decorating the front of the cap, cut-out section for hair and airflow, insertion of spacers or bands for absorption of perspiration, imbedded lights and varying shape designs. There are also designs for creating a cap that cools a wearer involving electric fans in the bill, detachable cold packs, circulating water tubes, and more. There are no designs however, that enhance the natural cooling of air flow.This invention features a smaller secondary bill underneath the main visor of a baseball cap and a gap between the two bills. The upper bill is slightly curved upwards. This creates an airfoil shape and draws air into the gap, thereby creating a flow of air over the wearer's head and inducing a cooling effect while not affecting any other functionality or the general appearance of the hat. The airfoil design even creates a flow of air over the head in the slightest cross breeze or at walking pace, making it very effective for increasing the comfort of spectators, golf players, joggers, softball and baseball players, or any other athletic activity where a hat or cap is worn.The attached drawings are to demonstrate the principles of the airfoil cooling design of the Air Cap. The design of the rest of the cap may vary depending upon user desire.The Air Cap is constructed to create an airfoil shape out of the visor. According to aerodynamic principles, air flowing over the top curve of an airfoil has a longer distance to travel and therefore must move faster than the air travelling under the airfoil. This principle is what creates lift in a wing. A curved bill also funnels air up the curve.By constructing an Air Cap with a normal-sized main visor or bill in the front with the main bill deliberately curved upwards where it is attached to the cap, the main bill becomes the top of curve of an airfoil shape (). Placing a short, flat, second bill underneath the main bill where the bill meets a wearer's head will create the bottom of an airfoil shape (). The main bill is attached to the cap above the interior brim, the second bill is attached to the directly to the interior brim, and both bills are attached to each other on the sides (). This creates a gap between the two bills from front to back, as seen in the cross section drawing ().The main bill is curved and measures wider than the second bill, attaching them at the sides will maintain the curvature of the main bill. The size for the gap between the bills at the highest point is approximately one half inch. The second bill is approximately one and a half inches long. The airfoil shape of the visor assembly creates a minor pressure difference under the main bill which funnels air into the gap and over a wearer's head.A slight cross-breeze or front breeze, or even air motion caused by a walking pace will induce a noticeable flow of air over a wearer's forehead and create a cooling effect. From the side () the exterior design of the Air Cap is not noticeably different than any other baseball cap. Making the second bill the same color as the underside of the main bill will camouflage the design even more (). Note that there is still plenty of room on the front of an Air Cap to place team or corporate logos.It is understood that the invention is not confined to the particular embodiments set forth herein as illustrative, but embraces all such modifications thereof as come within the scope of the design claims."

                "This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(a) to DK Application No. PA 2010 70310, filed Jul. 1, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.The present invention relates to a pair of trousers or pants, such as a pair of jeans, slacks, etc. More particularly, the present invention relates to a pair of trousers in which the appearance of the person wearing the pair of trousers is improved. It should be noted that the pair of trouser of the present invention could have any suitable length, ranging from shorts over knickers and skimpy trousers to full length trousers.It is often desirable for persons to wear garments which make the wearer appear slim. To this end, it has previously been attempted to manufacture garments which support certain parts of the body, such as the abdomen or the buttocks.U.S. Pat. No. D588,782 S discloses a pair of trousers with stitched pockets. The inside part of each pocket is provided with stitchings crossing each other approximately at the centre of each pocket.Embodiments of the invention provide a pair of trousers capable of providing efficient support for an abdominal part of a person wearing the pair of trousers.Embodiments of the invention further provide a pair of trousers capable of improving the appearance of a person wearing the pair of trousers.In an exemplary embodiment, a pair of trousers comprises two side seams, a front seam, a back seam and an inseam, the pair of trousers further comprising:In the present context the term ‘trousers’ should be interpreted to cover garments which are supposed to be worn on the lower part of the body with separate leg parts, regardless of the length of the garment. Thus, the term ‘trousers’ should be interpreted cover jeans, slacks, shorts, knickers, skimpy trousers, full length trousers, etc.The side seams are arranged along the sides of the trousers. The front seam is arranged at the part of the trousers which is arranged at a front side of a person wearing the trousers. The back seam is arranged at a back side of a person wearing the trousers. The inseam runs from a lower edge of one leg part to a lower edge of the other leg part, via the crotch of the trousers.The outer part substantially constitutes the pair of trousers in the sense that the outer part is what is visible when a person wears the trousers. The outer part is formed by sub-parts, such as four sub-parts, joined at the side seams, the front seam, the back seam and the inseam, in a usual manner.The inner part is arranged along a front part of the outer part, i.e., along a part of the outer part where the front seam is arranged. The inner part is arranged inside the trousers in the sense that, when a person wears the trousers, the inner part is arranged between the outer part and the person. Accordingly, the inner part is not visible when a person wears the trousers. The inner part is joined to the outer part at the side seams and at the front seam. Accordingly, the inner part substantially extends along the entire width of the front part, i.e., between the side seams.The outer part is made from a first material or fabric, and the inner part is made from a second material or fabric. The elasticity of the first material is significantly higher than the elasticity of the second material. In the present context the term ‘elasticity’ should be interpreted to mean the ability of the material to stretch, i.e., increase its length, along at least one direction, due to a force, such as a strain force, applied to the material, the material being capable of restoring its original size and shape when the force is no longer applied. Thus, a material having a high elasticity is capable of stretching more, due to a given force, than a material having a lower elasticity.For instance, the first material may be able to obtain an elongation of 20%-30% when a sample of the material is subjected to a pulling force within the interval 3 N to 7 N per cm width of the sample, while the second material may be able to obtain an elongation of less than 1%. In the present context the term ‘elongation’ should be interpreted to mean the ratio of the extension of the sample to its initial length when the sample is subjected to a predefined pulling force. The elasticity may advantageously be measured in accordance with the standard BS EN 14704-1, 2005, described in the publication entitled “Determination of the elasticity of fabrics—Part 1: Strip tests”.In one embodiment, the first material comprises elastane, while the second material does not comprise elastane. Since the elastic properties of elastane are very pronounced, a material comprising elastane must be expected to have an elasticity which is significantly higher than a material which does not comprise elastane.Since the elasticity of the material of the inner part is significantly lower than the elasticity of the outer part, and since the inner part is arranged along the front part of the outer part as described above, the inner part restricts the elasticity of the front part of the outer part, in the sense that the front part of the outer part is only allowed to stretch as much as the inner part allows, even though the material of the outer part would allow the outer part to stretch more under a given force, if the inner part had not been arranged along the front side.The inner part is provided with at least two stitchings extending from a first side seam towards the front seam and at least two stitchings extending from a second side seam towards the front seam. The stitchings extend along substantially straight lines, and in such a manner that the lines of the stitchings do not cross. This allows the stitchings to be arranged in such a manner that they follow the shape of an abdominal region of a person wearing the trousers, and in such a manner that they substantially cover an area defined by the abdominal region. Thereby, the stitchings provide efficient support for the abdomen, and the combination of the different elasticity properties of the inner part and the outer part and this positioning of the stitchings ensures that the abdomen of a person wearing the trousers is not allowed to expand the front part of the outer part, i.e., the abdomen is supported and ‘tucked in’. This makes the person wearing the trousers appear slim.The number of stitchings extending from each side seam may be exactly two, or it may be three or more, such as between three and seven stitchings, such as between three and five stitchings. The number of stitchings may depend on the size of the trousers, since the larger the size, the more stitchings are expected to be required in order to cover an area defined by the abdomen of a person wearing the trousers.The stitchings may be arranged with a first distance between neighbouring stitchings at the position of the side seam, and with a second distance between neighbouring stitchings at the position of the front seam, the second distance being larger than the first distance. According to this embodiment, stitchings extending from a given side seam towards the front seam define different slopes with respect to an upper rim, such as a lining, of the trousers, i.e., an angle is defined between neighbouring stitchings. According to this embodiment the shape of an abdomen of a person wearing the trousers is closely followed by the stitchings.End parts of the stitchings arranged at the side seams may be arranged substantially equidistantly within an interval positioned at a predefined distance from an upper rim of the pair of trousers. The interval may, for example, be defined in such a manner that stitchings arranged closest to the upper rim are arranged at a distance within the interval 5 cm to 10 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 6 cm to 9 cm from the upper rim, and in such a manner that the stitchings arranged furthest away from the upper rim are arranged at a distance within the interval 8 cm to 17 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 9 cm to 16 cm from the upper rim. The exact positioning of the stitchings depends on the size of the trousers. In the case that three or more stitchings are extending from each of the side seams, the remaining stitchings are, according to this embodiment, substantially evenly distributed between the stitchings arranged closest to the upper rim and the stitchings arranged furthest away from the upper rim.Similarly, end parts of the stitchings arranged at the front seam may be arranged substantially equidistantly within an interval positioned at a predefined distance from the inseam. The interval may, for example, be defined in such a manner that stitchings arranged closest to the upper rim are arranged at a distance within the interval 14 cm to 21 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 15.8 cm to 20.1 cm from the inseam, and in such a manner that the stitchings arranged furthest away from the upper rim are arranged at a distance within the interval 6 cm to 11 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 7.7 cm to 10.6 cm from the inseam. The exact positioning of the stitchings depends on the size of the trousers. For large sizes the area defined by the abdominal region of the person wearing the trousers must be expected to be larger than a corresponding area of a smaller size. Accordingly, for larger sizes the stitchings arranged furthest away from the upper rim must be arranged closer to the inseam than for smaller sizes, in order to ensure that the lowest part of the abdominal region is sufficiently supported by the stitchings. In the case that three or more stitchings are extending from each of the side seams, the remaining stitchings are, according to this embodiment, substantially evenly distributed between the stitchings arranged closest to the upper rim and the stitchings arranged furthest away from the upper rim.Each of the stitchings may be arranged in such a manner that an end part of the stitching arranged at a side seam is arranged closer to an upper rim of the pair of trouser than an end part of the stitching arranged at the front seam. According to this embodiment, each of the stitchings defines a downward slope from the side seam to the front seam. This ensures that the stitchings follow the shape of the abdomen of the person wearing the pair of trousers even better, thereby providing even better support for the abdomen.The stitchings may be flat lock stitchings. Flat lock stitchings are very suitable for this purpose, because flat lock stitchings are relatively wide. Thereby, each stitching is capable of providing support for the abdomen of the person wearing the pair of trousers, and visible ‘bumps’ on the abdomen of the wearer between the stitchings are avoided. Alternatively, any other suitable kind of stitchings providing sufficient support could be used.The inner part may be at least partly formed by pockets of the trousers. According to this embodiment, the inner part is formed by a part of the trousers which is present for other purposes. Alternatively, and in the case that the trousers do not comprise pockets, the inner part may be formed by an additional piece of fabric with the only purpose of providing support for an abdominal region of a person wearing the trousers.The pair of trousers may further comprise a fly arranged in the front seam, and the inner part may be formed by two separate parts arranged between the side seams and the fly. Such two separate parts may, for example, be two pockets. As an alternative, the trousers may be of a kind without a fly, for example, of the kind comprising an elastic waist band.According to one embodiment, the width of the front part of the outer part in a relaxed state may be substantially equal to the width of the inner part in a relaxed state. According to this embodiment, the inner part follows the front part of the outer part closely when the inner part and the front part are in relaxed states, i.e., when the inner part and the front part of the outer part are not subjected to strain forces. This allows the inner part to efficiently limit the elasticity of the front part of the outer part as described above.Since the outer part and the inner part are made from different materials, the shrinkage of the outer part may defer from the shrinkage of the inner part. Accordingly, the widths of the front part and the inner part, respectively, may advantageously be selected to take this into account. This may, for example, be done by selecting the widths in such a manner that they match after shrinking of the materials.is a schematic view of an upper part of a pair of trousers  according to a first embodiment of the invention. A front part of the pair of trousers , i.e., the part which is arranged on a front side of a person wearing the trousers , is shown. The pair of trouser  is shown inside out, i.e., two inner parts  in the form of pockets are visible and extending from side seams  to a front seam . A fly  with a zipper (not shown) is arranged at the front seam .An outer part  constitutes the part of the trousers  which is visible when the trousers  are worn by a person.The outer part  is made from a fabric having an elasticity which is significantly higher than the elasticity of the fabric which the inner part  is made from. Since the inner parts  are arranged along the entire width of the front part of the outer part , i.e., between the side seams , the inner parts  restrict the elasticity or stretchability of the front part of the outer part  in the sense that the front part of the outer part  is prevented from stretching more than the fabric of the inner parts  allows, even though the fabric of the outer part  would allow the front part to stretch further if the inner parts  had not been arranged along the front part.Each of the inner parts  is provided with three stitchings , each extending from a side seam  to the fly . The stitchings  may advantageously be flat lock stitchings. The stitchings  are arranged side-by-side, each stitching  defining a slope relative to a lining  of the pair of trousers , and in such a manner that the distance between neighbouring stitchings  is larger at the fly  than at the side seam . Each of the stitchings  is arranged closer to the lining  at the side seam  than at the fly . Furthermore, the stitchings  arranged on a given inner part  do not cross. Thus, the stitchings  are arranged in a manner which follows the natural shape of the abdomen of a person wearing the pair of trousers , and the stitchings , in combination with the elasticity properties of the fabric of the inner parts , therefore provide support for the abdomen, thereby ‘tucking’ the abdomen in and ensuring that the person wearing the trousers  appears slimmer.The distance between neighbouring stitchings  is sufficiently small to prevent that parts of the abdomen are allowed to protrude between the stitchings . It is also important that the lowest arranged stitchings , i.e., the stitchings  which are arranged closest to the crotch of the trousers , are arranged sufficiently low to be able to support the lowest part of the abdomen of the person wearing the trousers . Accordingly, the number of stitchings  as well as their arrangement on the inner parts  depends on the size of the pair of trousers . Thus, the embodiment shown in  is suitable for trousers  of approximately European size 36-44.In the embodiment of , at the side seams  the stitchings  are arranged in such a manner that the stitchings  arranged closest to the lining  are arranged at a distance within the interval 5 cm to 8 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 6 cm to 7 cm from the lining , depending on the size of the trousers . The stitchings  arranged furthest away from the lining  are arranged at a distance within the interval 8 cm to 14 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 9 cm to 13 cm from the lining , depending on the size of the trousers . The middle stitchings  are arranged approximately half way between the stitchings  arranged closest to and furthest away from the lining , the stitchings  thereby being arranged substantially equidistantly at the side seams .Similarly, at the fly  the stitchings  are arranged in such a manner that the stitchings  arranged closest to the lining  are arranged at a distance within the interval 15 cm to 17 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 15.8 cm to 16.1 cm from the inseam (not shown), depending on the size of the trousers . The stitchings  arranged furthest away from the lining  are arranged at a distance within the interval 7 cm to 11 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 8.3 cm to 9.5 cm from the inseam, depending on the size of the trousers . The middle stitchings  are arranged approximately half way between the stitchings  arranged closest to and furthest away from the lining , the stitchings  thereby being arranged substantially equidistantly at the fly .is a schematic view of a pair of trousers  according to a second embodiment of the invention. The pair of trousers  shown in  is very similar to the pair of trousers shown in , and it will therefore not be described in further detail here. However, in , each of the inner parts  is provided with four stitchings . This makes the embodiment shown in  suitable for larger sizes than the embodiment shown in . Thus, the embodiment shown in  is suitable for trousers  of approximately European size 46-50.In the embodiment of , at the side seams  the stitchings  are arranged in such a manner that the stitchings  arranged closest to the lining  are arranged at a distance within the interval 6 cm to 9 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 7 cm to 8 cm from the lining , depending on the size of the trousers . The stitchings  arranged furthest away from the lining  are arranged at a distance within the interval 13 cm to 15 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 13.5 cm to 14.5 cm from the lining , depending on the size of the trousers . The remaining stitchings  are substantially evenly distributed between the stitchings  arranged closest to and furthest away from the lining , the stitchings  thereby being arranged substantially equidistantly at the side seams .Similarly, at the fly  the stitchings  are arranged in such a manner that the stitchings  arranged closest to the lining  are arranged at a distance within the interval 15 cm to 19 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 16.2 cm to 17.7 cm from the inseam (not shown), depending on the size of the trousers . The stitchings  arranged furthest away from the lining  are arranged at a distance within the interval 7 cm to 10 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 7.7 cm to 9.2 cm from the inseam, depending on the size of the trousers . The remaining stitchings  are substantially evenly distributed between the stitchings  arranged closest to and furthest away from the lining , the stitchings  thereby being arranged substantially equidistantly at the fly .is a schematic view of a pair of trousers  according to a third embodiment of the invention. The pair of trousers  shown in  is very similar to the pair of trousers shown in , and it will therefore not be described in further detail here. However, in , each of the inner parts  is provided with five stitchings . This makes the embodiment shown in  suitable for even larger sizes than the embodiments shown in . Thus, the embodiment shown in  is suitable for trousers  of approximately European size 52-60.In the embodiment of , at the side seams  the stitchings  are arranged in such a manner that the stitchings  arranged closest to the lining  are arranged at a distance within the interval 8 cm to 10 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 8.5 cm to 9.5 cm from the lining , depending on the size of the trousers . The stitchings  arranged furthest away from the lining  are arranged at a distance within the interval 15 cm to 17 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 15.5 cm to 16.5 cm from the lining , depending on the size of the trousers . The remaining stitchings  are substantially evenly distributed between the stitchings  arranged closest to and furthest away from the lining , the stitchings  thereby being arranged substantially equidistantly at the side seams .Similarly, at the fly  the stitchings  are arranged in such a manner that the stitchings  arranged closest to the lining  are arranged at a distance within the interval 17 cm to 21 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 18.2 cm to 20.1 cm from the inseam (not shown), depending on the size of the trousers . The stitchings  arranged furthest away from the lining  are arranged at a distance within the interval 8 cm to 11 cm, such as at a distance within the interval 8.7 cm to 10.6 cm from the inseam, depending on the size of the trousers . The remaining stitchings  are substantially evenly distributed between the stitchings  arranged closest to and furthest away from the lining , the stitchings  thereby being arranged substantially equidistantly at the fly .It should be noted that even though  show trousers  with three, four and five stitchings  on each inner part , it is not ruled out that a pair of trousers  according to the present invention comprises fewer or more stitchings  on each inner part , such as two stitchings , six stitchings , seven stitchings , etc.show a pair of trousers  according to an embodiment of the invention. In , the pair of trousers  is shown with the outer part  facing outwards, i.e., in the manner they are normally worn. In  the pair of trousers  is shown inside-out, i.e., with the inner parts  facing outwards. This allows stitchings  on the inner parts  to be seen. Each inner part  is provided with three stitchings , and the embodiment shown in  is therefore similar to the first embodiment illustrated in . The remarks set forth above are therefore equally applicable here.The pair of trousers  shown in  is a full length pair of trousers .show a pair of trousers  according to an alternative embodiment of the invention. In , the pair of trousers  is shown with the outer part  facing outwards, i.e., in the manner they are normally worn. In  the pair of trousers  is shown inside-out, i.e., with the inner parts  facing outwards. This allows stitchings  on the inner parts  to be seen. Each inner part  is provided with three stitchings , and the embodiment shown in  is therefore similar to the first embodiment illustrated in . The remarks set forth above are therefore equally applicable here.The pair of trousers  shown in  is a pair of shorts, i.e. the length of the pair of trousers  shown in  is shorter than the length of the pair of trousers  shown in .It should be noted that even though  show trousers  having two specific lengths, it is not ruled out that a pair of trousers  according to the invention could have a length which differs from the length of the pair of trousers  illustrated in , and from the length of the pair of trousers  illustrated in . Thus, aspects of the present invention also cover trousers  having a length which is between the length of the pair of trousers  of  and the length of the pair of trousers  of . Furthermore, aspects of the present invention cover trousers  which are longer than the pair of trousers  of  and trousers  which are shorter than the trousers  of .While the invention has been illustrated by a description of the various embodiments, and while these embodiments have been described in considerable detail, it is not the intention of the Applicant to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and modifications will readily appear to those skilled in the art.

                "This is a continuation-in-part of patent application Ser. No. 12/432,828 filed on May 22, 2009 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8,015,624, granted on Sep. 13, 2011.The present invention relates to a helmet system that employs an outer shell and an inner shell formed with compatible ridges and grooves. The outer shell and inner shell are further secured together via magnetic force or conventional levers and springs in conjunction with a switch that allows for a user of the helmet system to seamlessly remove the outer shell through either a set amount of breakaway force or by deactivating the switch.Safety is paramount for many athletes playing in organized and unorganized sports. As such, protecting the head from injury is of prime importance. This is evident by the evolution of protective headgear. For example, the National Hockey League (NHL) did not officially require the use of helmets until the late 1970s. However, the first known professional player to wear a hockey helmet was George Owen in 1928. Hockey helmets among the professional ranks were considered in the 1930s after a helmetless “Ace” Bailey was forced to retire due to a head injury suffered during a game. In fact, the first professional hockey All-Star game was organized as a benefit to help support Bailey after the accident. Then in 1968, Minnesota player Bill Masterson, playing without a helmet, struck his head on the ice during a game against Oakland and ultimately died. This event caused numerous players to begin thinking about their physical safety in regard to head trauma. A few years later, lower levels of hockey began requiring helmets as the need became more pronounced. Today, the typical hockey helmet relates to a hard plastic shell that covers the cranial area of the head along with the ears. A chinstrap attached to the shell serves to lock the shell into a tight fit of the player.Current helmets do serve as protection from errant pucks and crashing into the boards, other players or the ice. However, a problem has arisen when it comes to the removal of a helmet during the course of a game. For example, many fans and players of hockey consider fighting an integral part of the game. But the reality is that during such fights a player will remove his or her helmet. This makes it easier to participate in the fight but also carries significant risks. These risks were exacerbated recently when a 21-year old hockey player in Ontario removed his helmet to participate in a run-of-the-mill hockey fight. The player ended up striking the ice and ultimately died. Such realities have caused numerous hockey leagues, to include the NHL, to ban the removal of a hockey helmet. These rules have created an outcry and caused significant disdain from fans and players who claim that the spirit and integral portion of the game is being removed. To this end, there is a need for a helmet system that can protect a player's head during a game, but also be easily removable in a manner that still offers a less-invasive form of head protection.In addition, such a need is not limited to hockey. For example, American football players throughout much of the sport's history merely wore leather helmets. However, these players now wear extensive head protection. At the same time, rugby players continue to wear older-style headgear. A problem often arises in these sports when the helmet flies off during a hard hit in the middle of a play. Once the helmet flies off, the play may still be active which means that the player may intentionally or inadvertently be involved in ongoing game activity without head protection. This is dangerous as players in such situations have been known to crash into the helmets/pads of other players in addition to the ground and even spikes from cleats as the player continues without the head protection. Because of this problem, there remains a need for a system of head protection that maintains a protective element for the head that offers close and continued protection even if the main bulk of the helmet is thrust off. In addition, this need also includes a stronger means of keeping a helmet secured to ones head during violent game situations.The present invention solves these problems by forming an inner shell formed via relatively soft padding or foam that fits relatively tightly to the player's head. A chinstrap is secured to the inner shell. Meanwhile, an outer shell is interlocked to the inner shell. The outer shell is what spectators and other players will see and will essentially cover the inner shell. At least one groove in the outer shell and at least one ridge on the inner shell fit together as part of a securing mechanism.Another need, particularly in regard to hockey, is the fact that helmets are removed very quickly during various situations to include fighting. The present invention satisfies this need in its preferred embodiment by placing a switch on the outer shell. This switch works in conjunction with the at least one groove and the at least one ridge as it utilizes ferromagnetic properties to force the outer shell and the inner shell together in an even closer and secure manner. In this way, the present invention makes it so that the only a certain amount of breakaway force or use of the switch will cause the outer shell and the inner shell to separate.Because this need is so pronounced, particularly in regard to sports fans and commentators, the general idea of using an inner helmet and an outer shell is known. For example, a column on the BLEACHER REPORT Web site on Jan. 20, 2009 entitled “The Helmet: A Simple Solution to NHL Fighting,” argued in support of such an idea to help keep fighting in NHL hockey while still offering protection. This article suggested that the chinstrap be attached to the inner helmet. However, articles, comments and other proposals relating to this at most describe a hard-cushioned back plate and an inner helmet designed along the lines of boxing headgear. Unlike the present invention, these ideas do not account for the stability of the outer shell and how the outer shell will interlock in a meaningful and tangible manner. The present invention responds to such important needs through its interlocking mechanisms and switch.U.S. Pat. No. 5,930,840 issued to Arai on Feb. 26, 1997 is a pad for interior body of helmet and interior body thereof. Arai includes interior pads that wrap around the persons head via a band. Unlike the present invention, Arai does not account for the stability of an outer shell and how any outer shell associated with Arai will interlock in a meaningful and tangible manner. The same rationale can go toward U.S. Pat. No. 6,446,271 issued to Ho on Sep. 10, 2002 because Ho also uses pads for its internal aspect but does provide for an interlocking mechanism that is as effective as that of the present invention. The present invention is much different as it responds to such important needs through its interlocking mechanisms and switch.U.S. Pat. No. 5,093,936 issued to Copeland et al on Mar. 10, 1992 is a protective headgear and detachable face protector. Copeland uses a rigid outer shell and an inner band of padding. Unlike the present invention, Copeland connects the inner band of padding to the rigid outer shell via a sizing harness that can be tightened or loosened via straps. Similar usage and concept relate to U.S. Pat. No. 6,298,497 issued to Chartrand on Oct. 9, 2001. Chartrand is a hockey helmet with self-adjusting pad. In contrast, the present invention uses the inner shell to thinly and lightly offer unitary protection to the head while engaging in the interlocking mechanism of the present invention to secure the inner shell to the outer shell.While the idea of an internal helmet and external helmet exists, none solve the need for a system that allows a player to seamlessly remove an interlocked outer shell while maintaining the protection of the protective inner shell. The present invention satisfies this need by forming a unitary inner shell to cover the cranial areas of the head. In addition, the interlocking mechanisms of the present invention provide additional stability and security between the inner shell and the outer shell. This means that the player can better be in control of the helmet during fights or even during a hard and violent hit that otherwise might knock the helmet loose. As such, the present invention is a novel helmet system that offers increased protection while also engaging in a system of quick removal or interlocking between the inner shell and outer shell.The present invention is a helmet system relating to the formation and connection of an outer shell and an inner shell. The function of the present invention is such that users wearing the outer shell and inner shell in a hockey context can quickly and seamlessly remove the outer shell when engaged in a fight. This means that the softer inner shell will remain secured to the user's head for protection of both the user and the hands of a combatant. In addition, the outer shell, based on the connection aspects of the present invention, will remain secured to the inner shell in a manner that will maintain the stability and intended utility of the outer shell until a set or angled force or switch causes the outer shell to be removed.The outer shell is formed via conventional means of a hard outer material to protect the user's head. The interior of the outer shell is preferably grooved or otherwise ridged so it can be interlocked with the inner shell. The inner shell is formed with complimentary ridges or grooves so that the inner shell and the outer shell can interlock. The inner shell is formed of conventional soft protective material such as foam. The inner shell directly touches the head of the user. It also should be noted that the system of the present invention places a chinstrap on the inner shell, facilitating secure placement of the present invention on the head of the user.The preferred embodiment of the present invention places at least one magnetic strip on the outer shell, and a compatible polarity magnetic strip on the inner shell. A switch or knob is formed into the outer shell and is preferably connected to a track within the outer shell. The track is where the at least one magnetic strip is located. The switch is conventional and when activated by the user, the magnetic properties of the magnetic strip in the outer shell will be attracted to the magnetic properties of the magnetic strip in the inner shell. In the preferred embodiment, a breakaway force is set via conventional means so that enough force of pulling the outer shell away from the inner shell will break the magnetic attraction, allowing the outer shell to be removed.The present invention relates to an outer shell () and an inner shell () that interlock.  is a view of the inner shell () of the present invention. The present invention in the preferred embodiment envisions a system for hockey headgear due to its practical nature pertaining to that sport. In the example of hockey, a player can quickly actuate a switch () to release the interlocked outer shell () from the inner shell () and seamlessly remove the outer shell (). In this way, the player can engage in fighting or any other activity while continuing to have the physical protection offered by the inner shell (). However, the present invention can be used with virtually any type of helmet, particularly in sports such as biking, American football, rugby, lacrosse, equestrian, etc.The inner shell () is formed of soft material such as foam and is unitary. The conventional material has a thickness to absorb direct blows derived from punches, the ground, boards, skates, shoes, other helmets, and errant projectiles such as balls or pucks that strike the inner shell (). The inner shell () is formed to fit snuggly onto the head of a user. A conventional chinstrap () is attached to the inner shell () for additional balance and securing of the inner shell ().The top of the inner shell () has grooves or ridges in the preferred embodiment. At least one ridge () is seen in  that protrudes outward from the surface of the inner shell (). The preferred embodiment places the at least one ridge () at strategic locations of the inner shell () such as the top, left and right sides. The at least one ridge () is configured to be inserted into at least one corresponding groove () that dips inward from the interior surface of the outer shell () at a depth and conventional makeup to permit a secure interlocking fit.The inner shell () also is formed in the preferred embodiment with at least one inner magnetic strip (). The at least one inner magnetic strip (), also referred to as at least one lower magnet (), is lined along the top surface of the inner shell (). In an additional embodiment, the at least one inner magnetic strip () is secured to the at least one ridge () of the inner shell (). The at least one lower magnet () is stationary in a fixed mounted position so that an upper magnet () comes to it.depicts an embodiment of the outer shell (). The outer shell () interlocks over the inner shell ().  shows the example of an outer shell () to be used in hockey. However, it should be noted that the elements of the present invention can apply to other types of headgear and purposes as well.The outer shell () is formed of hard material that conventionally is used for the respective sport or activity being used. The interior of the outer shell is formed to fit over and around the inner shell (). At least one groove () is depressed inward into the interior of the outer shell (). The at least one groove () is formed to correspond and receive the at least one ridge () protruding from the inner shell (). It also should be noted that in an additional embodiment, the at least one groove () is formed from the inner shell () and the at least one ridge () is formed from the outer shell ().Once the at least one ridge () is fitted into the at least one groove (), the at least one ridge () will be interlocked within the at least one groove (). In the preferred embodiment, at least one outer shell magnetic strip (), also referred to as at least one upper magnet () is lined within the interior of the outer shell (). When activated, the at least one upper magnet () will be of such polarity via conventional means that it will attract and therefore lock with the corresponding at least one lower magnet (). In the preferred embodiment, the at least one outer shell magnetic strip () is lined between a ferromagnetic track () that is surrounded by soft, protective material formed within the interior of the outer shell (). The at least one upper magnet () is variable in that is can rotate within the ferromagnetic track (). The at least one upper magnet () is formed with notches on the sides of the at least one upper magnet that communicate with at least one arm ().The at least one upper magnet () is in communication with a switch () via the at least one arm (). The switch () in the preferred embodiment is a small knob located on an accessible outer portion of the outer shell (). The switch () also may be a lever. The preferred embodiment places the switch () at the top of the outer shell (), although the switch () also may be located in the back or on the sides of the outer shell (). The switch (), when turned by a user, moves the at least one arm (). The at least one arm () is positioned via conventional means to be received in a downward motion by the notches of the at least one upper magnet (). Turning the switch () therefore causes the at least one arm () to rotate the at least one magnet () to correspond with the movement of the switch (). Once the poles of the at least one upper magnet () are parallel or close to being parallel to the opposite polarity poles of the at least one lower magnet (), the at least one upper magnet () and the at least one lower magnet () will interlock.The interlocking capability of the magnets can be deactivated by moving the switch (). This process will ultimately move or rotate the at least one upper magnet () so that its polar attributes no longer attract with the polar attributes of the at least one lower magnet (). In addition to the switch (), breakaway force also can be used to remove the outer shell () from the inner shell (). The size, makeup and other conventional properties of the at least one upper magnet () and at least one lower magnet () will determine the breakaway force needed to separate the magnets.presents a view of the present invention when the outer shell () is interlocked with the inner shell (). As we see, the outer shell () is configured to fit over the inner shell (). The inner shell () is configured to be worn or otherwise encompass the cranial area of a person's head. Once the at least one ridge () is placed into the at least one groove (), the outer shell () and the inner shell () will be connected to each other. In the preferred embodiment, the switch () is located on the outer shell ().In an additional embodiment, the at least one groove () and the at least one ridge () are at such angles and formed in such a manner that the at least one ridge () can only be placed into the at least one groove () if inserted at a specific angle. For example, the at least one ridge () may only fit tightly into the at least one groove () at a 45-degree or 90-degree angle. In this regard, the outer shell () can only be removed from its connection with the inner shell () if the outer shell () is removed at the same 45-degree or 90-degree angle.In an additional embodiment as seen in , the at least one groove () and the at least one ridge () are positioned in strategic locations along the inner shell () and outer shell () to include top, sides, front and rear areas of the outer shell () interior and inner shell () exterior respectively. Thin and pliable springs are in communication with the switch (). The springs also are in communication with thin and pliable levers that are interwoven into either the at least one ridge () or the at least one groove (). In this embodiment, the at least one ridge () is pushed into the at least one groove (), which is slightly pliable and thinner than the at least one ridge () at its top, until the at least one ridge () is inserted and the at least one groove () snaps via conventional connection means via the force of the at least one ridge () insertion. The switch () when activated compresses the springs so that the levers slightly widen the at least one groove () at its top. This activation and widening movement will allow the at least one ridge () to be removed from the at least one groove () and consequently, the outer shell () can be released from the inner shell ().It also should be noted that an alternative version of this embodiment of the present invention entails actuating the switch () before interconnecting the inner shell () and the outer shell (). In this embodiment, the switch () will actuate the springs which in turn will widen the at least one groove () so that the at least one ridge () can be inserted. When the switch () is released, the springs and levers also release their hold on the at least one groove () so that it tightens and consequently locks around the at least one ridge ().This release aspect of the present invention in terms of the switch () also applies to the preferred embodiment relating to the at least one upper magnet () and at least one lower magnet (). This means that once the switch is actuated, the interlocking connection between the outer shell () and the inner shell () will be released and/or connected either via embodiments featuring magnetic force or conventional snapping into place. In an additional embodiment, conventional connecting material such as VELCRO in relation to the outer shell and the inner shell also envisioned.In some embodiments of the present invention, it is envisioned that the inner shell () could function as an independent, albeit weaker, level of protection for the user's head, as rather than simply a mounting platform for the outer shell (). In this manner, the present invention could be applicable to multiple sports without excessive modification. For example, a user would preferably employ the helmet system of the present invention in its entirety—namely with the inner shell () firmly affixed to the outer shell () for an intense contact sport such as hockey, whereas public skating on a skating rink could only require users to wear the inner shell () of the present invention. Other sports, such as sledding would also preferably only require the inner shell () of the present invention. It is envisioned that the present invention could potentially be used for a wide variety of sports, including bicycling, horse riding, motor-cross racing, skateboarding, etc.Similarly, it is noted that the inner shell () of the present invention could be envisioned as being easily interchangeable with a wide assortment of other liners, acting as alternate inner shells () to the present invention. For example, a lighter, more breathable inner shell () could be used for summer activities such as skateboarding, and a heavier, warmer inner shell () could be use for winter sports, such as snowboarding or skiing. Alternately, it is envisioned that the inner shell () of the present invention could be composed of Kevlar for army or other law enforcement uses.The system of the present invention could also feasibly be used for racecar driver helmets, such as those used by stock car and Indy-car drivers. Current standard driver helmets employ a tether that connects the driver's helmet to the seat, ensuring that the driver's head remains stable during a crash. However, sometimes this safety feature can increase the time required to escape the vehicle after a crash, which can be especially dangerous if the car is on fire. The system of the present invention could allow the driver to quickly remove the outer shell (), which would preferably remain attached to the seat, and escape the vehicle while wearing only the inner shell () of the helmet, which would preferably be composed of a flame retardant material in order to protect the driver. This implementation of the system of the present invention could instantly decrease the amount of time required to escape a crashed race vehicle.Similarly, it can be envisioned that, in alternate embodiments of the present invention, the switch () could be fashioned similar to a conventional automotive seat belt switch, removing the need for a magnet and groove system. This could also be employed as a supplement to the magnet and groove system, rather than a substitution. Other embodiments may employ other various types of switches, used in conjunction with a latching system, in order to keep the outer shell () temporarily secured to the inner shell () of the present invention. Alternatively, a spring-loaded quick release could be implemented into the present invention, in order to facilitate the rapid removal of the outer shell (). This could include a simple handle on a small string, designed to be easily pulled when the user desires.Alternative iterations of he present invention could employ at least one switch () that functioned similarly to the conventional interlocking plastic switch commonly found on rechargeable battery packs for cordless power drills or other similar plastic connectors. In this likeness, the switch () would be composed of a conventional male member with a tip protruding perpendicularly from the plane of the member, and is fashioned to interlock within a gapped confine of a proportionally larger size, in order to accommodate the member, preferably attached to the outer shell ().Another embodiment of the present invention could feature an alternate track system designed to maintain the alignment of the inner shell () and the outer shell () when in use. In this embodiment, a preferably plastic or metal track would be implemented into the outer shell () and inner shell (), fashioned to interlock in a conventional fashion.Likewise, it is envisioned that the system of the present invention could exhibit or feature at least one collapsible sack, similar to a small pouch, preferably located between the inner shell () and the outer shell (). This at least one collapsible sack is designed to be imperceptible to the user when the present invention is in use. The intent of the collapsible sack is to indicate if the helmet has sustained a severe enough impact to cause structural damage to the helmet, such that it would no longer be fit to safely secure the user's cranium under the duress of a subsequent impact. The collapsible sack is preferably colored, such that it is easy to determine if the helmet is still safe for use. For example, after sustaining an impact, the user would examine the interior of the outer shell (), where the collapsible sack is preferably located. If the collapsible sack is green, the helmet is still safe to wear; however a red, collapsed sack would indicate helmet replacement is necessary. Any other color variations could be used in a likewise fashion, as long as two or more distinct colors are employed. The pressure or intensity by which the collapsible sack is triggered to collapse will preferably be determined through experimental testing, to evaluate the estimated sustainable impact the helmet of the present invention, depending upon the material composition and density of the outer shell (). It is envisioned that at least one collapsible sack may be placed in multiple locations, such as the temples, and the rear and front of the present invention, in order to best gauge the integrity of the present invention.Additional features of the present invention could preferably be designed to facilitate comfort for all users of the present invention. These features could include, but are not limited to, adjustable liner padding, adjustable straps, adjustable vents designed to cool the user, and other adjustable components. An air-adjustment system could be implemented with a variable, incremental switch, conventionally designed to increase or decrease the extent of ventilation within the present invention. The user would preferably separate the inner shell () from the other shell () of the present invention in the event the helmet system of the present invention becomes wet. Removing the outer shell () facilitates rapid drying of the present invention as well, helping to prevent mold from forming between the inner shell () and the outer shell ().Other embodiments of the present invention could feature readily interchangeable graphic inserts or paintings for color in order to differentiate each helmet from another. ‘Skins’ could alternately be employed to make each helmet unique, similar to those found on conventional cell phones or computer covers. These cosmetic changes would not affect the safety of the helmet system.It is to be understood that the present invention is a helmet system, comprised of an outer shell () configured to hold on to an inner shell (), and release from said inner shell (). The outer shell () is configured to fit and preferably completely cover the inner shell (). The inner shell () is configured to cover the cranial portion of a head. The outer shell () of the present invention is more impact resistant than the inner shell (). The inner shell () is preferably unitary. Similarly, the outer shell () is preferably unitary.Likewise, it is to be understood that the present invention is a helmet system comprising forming an inner shell () to fit snuggly onto a head of a user, forming an outer shell () to completely cover the inner shell (); and locking the outer shell () to the inner shell (). The outer shell () is said to be more impact resistant than the inner shell (). The helmet system also being capable of releasing the outer shell () from the inner shell () via an established amount of breakaway force, such as in a fight or emergency situation.Alternately, the present invention may be considered a helmet system created by forming an inner shell () to fit snuggly onto a head of a user and the inner shell () being unitary, then placing an outer shell () over the inner shell () to completely cover the inner shell (). Additionally, a switch is preferably placed on the outer shell (). The outer shell is said to be interlocking to the inner shell () when the switch is activated, and releasing the outer shell () from the inner shell when the switch is activated.It is to be understood that the present invention is not solely limited to the invention as described in the embodiments above, but further comprises any and all embodiments within the scope of this application."

                "The invention relates to a body protective clothing, comprising a hard shell for covering the body part to be protected and an impact protection arranged at the inside of the body protective clothing wherein the impact protection comprises an impact absorbing foam enclosed by an airtight casing and at least a valve arranged at the airtight casing.Conventional body protective clothing, for example crash helmets for the head, consist of a hard outer shell and an impact absorbing layer at the inside, thus to at the side closer to the respective body part to be protected, wherein the impact absorbing layer is mostly produced from polystyrene.A drawback is that polystyrene is quite stiff and little impact absorbing whereby the force in case of a crash cannot be softly cushioned.Rather, the crash energy is directly transmitted to the body part, for example in the case of a crash helmet, to the head, which may lead to more or less severe injuries, as for example craniocerebral traumas.Further, a hard polystyrene inner shell is little comfortable but hard and inflexible so that it cannot adapt to the different shapes of the body parts to be protected in different humans.For example, there are crash helmets only with few different sizes for outer or inner shell, respectively, thus an adaptation to the very varied head shapes in humans being possible only to a limited extent.For this adaptation to the respective user, in helmets are mostly used systems which are size-adjustable by pull cords.For improving the above mentioned drawbacks, helmets with inner air cushion are already described where, however, in practice has been proven that the air is displaced by the pressure in case of a crash only into other zones of the air cushion, the head thereby directly bumping onto the helmet's outer shell.For the priority scope of crash damping, such an air cushion is thus not suited. A further drawback of such body protective clothing, in particular of such crash helmets with inner air cushion, is that a pump is necessary for filling the cushion. If such a pump is integrated in the helmet, as for example in EP 0 423 711, a complex construction of the helmet is necessary for this purpose.Furthermore, a pump represents a component at risk of failure and defect.Taking along an external pump is, however, equally laborious and not desired by the consumers.EP 1 316 264, too, shows a helmet with an air cushion in the interior of the helmet wherein a pump is necessary for filling the cushion. But this invention again has the drawback that in case of a crash the air is pushed from the front side of the helmet backside and that thus the head is directly bumping onto the outer shell of the helmet.Additionally, the air cushion is filled with air only after putting on the helmet, whereby it is possible that an overpressure forms in the helmet whereby to pressure points and following headache may develop.U.S. Pat. No. 5,890,232 as well as EP 0 393 238 A1 show a further helmet with an inflatable air bag with the same, just above described drawbacks.In the last mentioned document the pump, for example, is integrated in the chin bar what involves a high constructive effort and is accompanied by an important risk of defect.U.S. Pat. No. 6,681,408 describes a helmet with an impact protection, which has an air and a foam cushion. Further, a valve is provided with which air can be introduced and let out and thus the air density in the cushion can be regulated.Again, in case of a crash the air in the cushion is displaced, the head thereby directly bumping onto the hard outer shell of the helmet.Scope of the invention is to provide a body protective clothing, in particular a helmet, where an impact protection is present which can in the best-possible mode absorb the crash energy as a result of an accident thereby significantly increasing the security of the user of such a body protective clothing and avoiding—in case of the version as helmet—the drawbacks of the above mentioned helmets.Furthermore, the invention should increase the wearing comfort of conventional body protective clothing, particularly of conventional crash helmets.This is obtained by a body protective clothing with the features of claim .Materials known per se are used for the hard shell which during use of the body protective clothing at least partially surrounds the body part to be protected and therefore serves for covering the body part to be protected and thus in case of a crash represents the first protective layer.At the inside of these outer shell an impact protection is arranged, which therefore during the use of the body protective clothing is located between the body parts to be protected and the hard shell.The impact protection can here be fixed to the hard shell, whereby the type of fixing is basically arbitrary and methods known in the prior art can be used.Additionally, at the side of the impact protection facing the body part to be protected a textile layer can be arranged which produces a comfortable contact between the body protective clothing and the body part and hereby is also beneficial for the hygiene by being for example sweat absorbing and being designed as to be removable from the impact protection for cleaning.The impact protection itself comprises an airtight casing and at least a valve arranged at this airtight casing.Inside the airtight casing a foam is arranged which is especially configured for absorption of impacts. The foam can be constructed in variegated form for example multi-layered, it can be designed as gas permeable, open-pored, and more or less compact.The shape of the foam is variable because the foam is soft and also partially elastic, the impact protection thereby can adapt and nestle to the body part to be protected so that in case of a crash the crash energy can be distributed relatively uniformly across the whole abutting body area.Because of an accident and of a crash that goes along with it the impact protection is strongly and rapidly compressed building up an overpressure in the impact protection. In particular, the air present in the impact protection, which for example is located in the pores of the foam, is compressed.In order to dissipate now the energy built up thereby in the impact protection and so to attenuate the crash, the valve arranged at the airtight casing is realized as a pressure relief valve and lets air escape thereby dissipating the crash energy. The crash is attenuated via this energy dissipation by the escaping air in addition to the impact absorption by the compression of the foam. In order to avoid a possible erroneous activation of the valve realized as a pressure relief valve, the valve is designed in such a way that it opens only from a certain inner pressure in the impact protection.Further advantageous embodiments of the invention are defined in the dependent claims and are described in detail below.In a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is foreseen that an inlet valve is further provided at the airtight casing for the inlet of air into the impact protection.This valve can be foreseen separately from the valve realized as a pressure relief valve for the pressure reduction. However, it may be also provided that both valves are realized as a single, common valve with a function for pressure reduction in case of overpressure in the impact protection and with a function for the inlet of air, thus reducing the number of components.If the respective user applies the body protective clothing according to the invention, for example puts it on—if the body protective clothing is realized as a crash helmet, the foam variable with respect to its shape and size can adapt to the respective user possibly producing an overpressure in the impact protection.Contrary to the compression as a result of a crash or an accident this pressure built-up in case of putting on or applying the body protective clothing is much smaller and takes place more slowly.To avoid pressure points during use, it may be provided that also this overpressure not developed by a crash is degraded by means of a valve.Hereby, this function can be implemented in the inlet valve, for example if this is formed as check valve.However, it may also be provided that the valve present for the reduction of the overpressure formed as a result of a crash, also the small overpressure originating from the application of the body protective clothing is reduced by this valve.The pressure relief valve can here be realized in such a way that it can distinguish between a rapid compression and a slow compression and thus also opens if the small overpressure originating from the application of the body protective clothing appears.However, it may also be provided that the inlet valve or the valve realized as a pressure relief valve is opened manually before and/or after the application or putting on of the body protective clothing, respectively, and that thereby the pressure formed by the adaptation of the impact protection to the body shape of the user is reduced. Thus, an as optimal as possible fit and a high wearing comfort of the body protective clothing can be obtained.In this case thus, one of the above-mentioned valves is opened before and/or during donning slightly compressing the foam in the impact protection during donning and the foam thereby adapting to the body shape of the user.The opened valve reduces the thereby developed overpressure.If the fit of the body protective clothing is satisfying, the valve is dosed again so that air can only escape via the valve realized as a pressure relief valve, when in case of a crash a certain pressure is reached or exceeded in the impact protection, respectively.It may also be provided that the valve realized as a pressure relief valve responds additionally a alternatively to an increase in pressure and opens from a certain pressure increase rate.Furthermore, it may be provided that the valve closes again from a certain pressure after the increased pressure has been reduced.Particularly preferred is that the inlet valve is realized in such a way that it can absorb air because of a low pressure present in the impact protection.Thereby, it can be rendered possible that no pump is necessary to pump up the impact protection with air thereby strongly increasing the ease of use of the body protective clothing according to the invention.Here it is advantageous that the inlet valve has to be opened manually to permit the suction procedure.In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the impact absorbing foam arranged in the impact protection is viscoelastic and has a shape memory function.That means that the foam, after the impact protection during use of the body protective clothing has nestled to the body part to be protected and thereby has at least partially assumed its external shape, forms back again by essentially reassuming again its original shape via expansion after use of the body protective clothing.The impact protection thus has a restoring effect whereby restoring its original shape can take place, depending on the construction of the inlet valve, automatically or after manual operation.Such foams are known per se in the prior art and are referred to as “memory foams” on the market and are used for example in latex mattresses.The restoring effect of the foam according to the invention is advantageous also in case of a crash.As outlined above, an overpressure is produced in the impact protection as a result of a crash which is degraded by the valve realized as a pressure relief valve via air outlet.Thereby, the cushioning of the impact energy is supported additionally to the pressure reduction via air outlet by means of the compression of the viscoelastic foam in the impact protection.After a crash, the foam in the impact protection is compressed. But the foam, because of its shape memory function, has the tendency to return into its original form whereby inside the airtight casing of the impact protection a low pressure develops which can automatically open the inlet valve and the foam can restore together with the airtight casing its original shape.Nevertheless, it may also be provided that the inlet valve has to be operated manually to permit an air inlet. It is essentially that no pump is needed what strongly increases the ease to use of the body protective clothing according to the invention.For this purpose, of course it is useful that the material of the airtight casing is flexible and variable in its shape thereby not standing in the way of a change of shape of the impact protection. This ensures that on the one hand different users can use the body protective clothing because the foam and therewith the impact protection can adapt to the respective user and no predetermined shape of the inside of the body protective clothing is present for all users.Thus, a particularly high and especially for a plurality of users equal wearing comfort is given.The airtight casing of the impact protection itself, however, has to be little or not elastic, in particular not tensile and not tensionally elastic as otherwise in case of a crash an expansion bubble could form at the weakest point of the impact protection.In addition, the function as impact protection is particularly well given as the foam fits by means of the adaptability as uniformly as possible around the body part to be protected and thereby can absorb much energy in case of a crash.In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention this restoring and expansion of the foam is obtained letting in air via a valve arranged at the airtight casing of the impact protection.During use of the body protective clothing, in particular if this is more or less strongly fixed to the user, forces are acting on the impact protection, which have caused an adaptation of the impact protection to the outer body shape and a small compression of the foam.If the user puts off the body protective clothing these forces are missing so that in the impact protection there is low pressure which absorbs air via the above described inlet valve wherein in a preferred embodiment of the invention for this purpose the inlet valve has to be opened, whereon air then is absorbed spontaneously into the impact protection.A pump arranged in the helmet or a pump taken along externally is not necessary thereby increasing considerably the comfort of use and the absence of breakdowns of the body protective clothing according to the invention.In one embodiment of the invention it is foreseen that the impact protection not only a single chamber enclosed by an airtight casing with the impact absorbing foam is formed but has a plurality of chambers, several of these chambers being filled with the impact absorbing foam.Particularly, in extensive body protective clothing, as in a helmet, it can thereby be permitted that the adaptation to the body part to be protected is even better possible and that in case of a crash single chambers selectively have an energy absorbing or energy dissipating effect, respectively.Thereby it may be foreseen that several chambers are equipped with a valve for pressure reduction and/or an inlet valve, whereby again a single valve can exert both functions, thus autonomously having effect as impact protection.However, it may also be advantageous that several chambers are communicating with each other via an air conduit system thereby permitting that not each of the chambers filled with an impact absorbing foam has to include such valves and that the pressure can be directed across several chambers to the valve.If the chambers are interconnected, it may be provided to arrange the inlet valve or the inlet valves and additionally or alternatively, the pressure relief valve or the pressure relief valves at the connections between the chambers, which are also part of the impact protection.In a further embodiment of the invention it is foreseen that between the hard shell and the impact protection a further impact absorbing layer, preferably of polystyrene, is arranged.Such polystyrene layers are the only impact-absorbing layer in conventional helmets. By means of the additional arrangement of such an impact absorbing layer the energy dissipation or the energy absorption, respectively, can be additionally increased in case of a crash. Since this additional impact absorbing layer is arranged between the impact protection according to the invention and the hard shell, the advantages of the impact protection, i.e. the adaptation to the respective user, are, however, not diminished.In an advantageous embodiment of the invention it is provided that the impact absorbing foam is viscoelastic and consists, for example, of polyurethane, in particular of a polyurethane foam.Furthermore, it may be provided that the hard shell also comprises synthetic material. Such cured synthetic materials can for example also comprise polyurethane.However, it may also be provided to use elastomers or other thermoplastic synthetic materials because these are particularly easy to produce by means of injection molding. In general, however, all hard materials (for example, also metals like titanium or aluminum or wood) are useable as hard shells.Composite materials are possible, too. Advantageous are here materials, which have a sufficient hardness but a low weight.In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, fixing means are provided at the body protective clothing for fixing the body protective clothing to the body.These are fixing means known per se like for example, in case of a crash helmet, chin bars or further belt-like fixing systems. Belt systems are also useful for other body protective clothing. However, velcro closures or other strap-like fixing means may be provided.It may also be advantageous that further external devices for adapting the fit to the body part to be protected are provided at or in the body protective clothing, respectively. These are also devices known per se in the prior art.In a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, means for aeration are arranged in the body protective clothing. Thus, an air exchange between body and outside air is possible, what can induce a cooling.This is particularly useful in extensive body protective clothing, like in a helmet, because a heat accumulation can develop due to the airtight impact protection what negatively affects the wearing comfort.In the case of aeration means, these may be for example holes in the hard shell as well as holes in the impact protection, in particular between several of the impact protection chambers. In addition, channels are conceivable which direct the air to a certain area.This is again particularly true for crash helmets where the airstream of the front side can be used for the aeration of the head. It may also be provided that the body protective clothing, in particular the impact protection, has openings for determined body parts. For example, a helmet according to the invention can have recesses for the ears.Such a body protective clothing particularly concerns a crash helmet for the protection of the head, elbow protectors, knee protectors, wrist protectors and different protectors, like for example back protectors.shows a partially cut-away side view of a conventional helmet  of the prior art. Here a hard shell  with a subjacent impact absorbing polystyrene layer  as a preventive measure against injuries in case of a crash with the head is provided. The only energy absorbing medium represents in this case the marginally shape variable polystyrene layer .Furthermore, a flexible ear member  with vent holes  and a chin bar  for fixing the helmet  is illustrated.Apart from the drawback, that only the polystyrene layer  has an impact absorbing effect, it was found that also the wearing comfort of the conventional helmet  cannot be optimal, as—because of the only small number of different helmet sizes—mostly a gap  remains free behind the head, where the textile layer  arranged at the inside of the polystyrene layer  not abuts on the head. An often inadequate and cumbersome size adjustment is carried out by a pull cord system  with a regulation device .On the other hand, in  in a partially cut-away side view of a body protective clothing according to the invention realized as a helmet  it can be seen how the impact protection  filled with partially elastic, particularly viscoelastic foam conforms oneself to the head shape so that the textile layer  arranged for hygiene and for wearing comfort fits all over the head.Here again, a flexible earflap  with vent holes  as well as a chin bar  for fixing the helmet  is arranged. A pull cord system  with regulation device , however, can be abandoned. The points in the foam of the impact protection  here represent pores of the foam. In case of a compression of the foam, these pores are more or less closed, thus increasing the foam density and the pressure inside the impact protection .shows in a side view the helmet  according to the invention with hard shell  and flexible ear member .In this case, the impact protection  arranged under the hard shell  consists of two chambers , ′ which are filled with partially elastic, in particular viscoelastic foam. The chambers , ′ are represented in hatched form. In addition, a connection  between the chambers , ′ which permits an air exchange between these chambers , ′ is illustrated. This connection  is also part of the impact protection .In , the area labeled with A of  is shown in a detailed view. At this connection , an inlet valve is arranged. However, additionally it may be provided that this inlet valve  is arranged at the front chamber  or at the rear chamber ′, because an air exchange between the chambers  and ′ is rendered possible by the connection .After use of the helmet  or after a crash, when the foam located in the chambers , ′ has been compressed and when, because of its tendency given by the shape memory function to return into its original shape, a low pressure emerges in the impact protection , i.e. in the chambers  and/or ′, a pressure compensation can take place by means of this inlet valve .This inlet valve  can be manually operated so that it is opened for example by means of finger pressure onto this inlet valve . However, it may also be provided that from a certain low pressure this valve  automatically opens and then, in case of pressure compensation, it automatically closes again.This inlet valve , however, can additionally also reduce a small overpressure in the impact protection  therefore letting escape air when the impact protection  adapts to the head shape by putting on the helmet and the foam in the impact protection  is somewhat compressed.On the rear side of the helmet  not represented in , two valves , ′ realized as pressure relief valves are arranged between the chambers , ′.However, it may also be provided that here too only one of these pressure relief valves is arranged on a connection between the chambers , ′.It is also possible that the inlet valve  itself is realized as a pressure relief valve , and thus to permit both functions, the release of air as well as the inlet of air.By means of the autonomous pressure release valves , ′ it is in any case guaranteed that a localized energy dissipation of the impact energy is possible, while in case of a crash on the front side only the front pressure release valve  opens or in case of a crash more in the rear area of the helmet  only the pressure relief valve ′ of the rear chamber ′ opens.In case of a high impact energy, these pressure relief valves , ′ permit a further energy absorption or energy dissipation, respectively, in addition to the viscoelastic foam being compressed in the chambers , ′.The valves , ′ may be designed so that they open only from a certain overpressure which forms as a result of the compression of the foam in the chambers , ′.In case of a crash with only small energy, the impact absorption in this case merely takes place by means of the foam being compressed. However, it may also be provided that the pressure relief valves , ′ open already at a small overpressure so that in case of small impact energy the air exciting the valves , ′ is sufficient as impact absorption.In  a partially cut-away representation of an embodiment of an inlet valve  is illustrated. This is a spring-loaded check valve, wherefore inside the housing  a spring  is arranged. The closure element  is closed in one direction by the spring , whereas it is released in the other direction by overcoming the spring force. Thus, the inlet valve  can be used for the compensation of the pressure in the chambers , , i.e. in the impact protection .Apart from the air inlet function, this inlet valve  can also assume the pressure compensation function in case of the small overpressure emerging by the application, i.e. by putting on the body protective clothing, in the impact protection , while this adapts to the body shape. If, for example, the helmet  is put on, the volume available for the air is reduced and the pressure slightly increased.To obtain an optimum wearing comfort, a pressure compensation is carried out via the inlet valve .This functionality is similar to that of a bicycle valve. After having taken off again the helmet  or in general the body protective clothing, a low pressure has formed in the impact protection  because of the viscoelastic foam which can also be compensated by this inlet valve  automatically or after manual operation.Precondition to the operation of this inlet valve , which is realized as a check valve, is a not or only slightly tensile, but flexible airtight casing of the impact protection .In  a pressure relief valve  is illustrated which limits the maximum permissible pressure in the chambers ,  of the impact protection. If the pressure in the impact protection  exceeds as a result of a compression of the foam by a crash a certain adjustable limit value, this pressure relief valve  permits the air outlet so that precisely this maximum pressure is protected against exceeding, thus realizing an overpressure protection.In this embodiment the housing  comprises again a spring . The valve opening  realized as a needle valve is provided with a sealing .In a partially cut-away side view of a helmet  according to the invention is illustrated. Apart from the vent holes  in the flexible ear member  further vent holes ′ are arranged in the hard shell  and in the impact protection. The impact protection itself again can comprise one or more chambers.By means of these vent holes ′ it is possible to feed cooling air to the head so that the helmet  according to the invention, for example, is advantageously applicable also for sweat-inducing kinds of sport as cycling.In a further embodiment of the impact protection  according to the invention is illustrated. In addition to the vent holes ′ a further opening  is provided, serving for including the ears.In a rear view of a body protection clothing realized as a back protector  is illustrated. This back protector  comprises a hard shell which, in case of use, is arranged at the outside of the body, thus at the side facing away from the body. Two arm slings , ′ and an abdominal belt  serve for fixing to the user.In a front view of this back protector  is illustrated, wherein the impact protection  which, where appropriate, directly abuts with a textile strap  on the body, is illustrated in hatched form.For reasons of clarity, no pressure relief valve  and no inlet valve  are illustrated.In a further embodiment of a body protective clothing according to the invention is illustrated. A knee protection  again has a hard shell  arranged at the outside and two fastening straps , ′.In a rear view of the knee protection  is illustrated, where the impact protection  arranged in the inside is represented as hatched area.The fastening straps , ′ are preferably fixable by means of velcro closures. For reasons of clarity, no pressure relief valve  and no inlet valve  are represented.It goes without saying that the body protective clothing according to the invention is not limited to the embodiments represented in the figures, nor shall be limited by them, but comprises all technical equivalents which may fall into the range of the following claims.In particular, the body protective clothing according to the invention is not limited to special kinds of application. Thus, crash helmets according to the invention are conceivable as motorcycle helmets, ski helmets, bicycle helmets, climbing helmet, safety helmets for dangerous work, and the like."

It is desirable that the polymeric film is made from an elastic polymer. The air-permeability can be provided from a series of perforations such that the film's elastic quality tends to contract the perforations thereby impeding the progress of water through them under normal conditions.

                "This application is a continuation of co-pending application Ser. No. 11/211,315 filed Aug. 25, 2005, which application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/604,607 filed Aug. 26, 2004. The contents of both of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.The invention relates generally to an energy-absorbing pad that is encapsulated by a sealed film, and more particularly to a viscoelastic energy-absorbing foam pad encapsulated by a perforated polymer film.Polymeric protective foams (e.g. protective foam layers) are widely used for impact force attenuation in a variety of safety-related applications. These include sport applications, military combat applications, automotive applications, footwear applications, etc. In general, a protective foam layer is placed adjacent or against a part of a person's body to protect a body part (e.g. a head) during an impact.Protective foams function by absorbing and/or dissipating the impact energy from the force of an impact. An energy absorbing foam deforms or crushes on impact thereby consuming a portion of the impact energy to prevent its reaching the underlying body part. An energy dissipating foam also spreads the impact force over a larger surface area than the actual area of impact so the force per unit area is decreased for the underlying body part compared to that for the initial impact surface (e.g. the outer surface of the protective layer or a hard outer shell over the protective layer).Traditionally, rigid foam pads are used in safety-related applications, made from foams that are non-recovering (i.e., they do not recover or rebound to any significant degree once they have been crushed) and do not provide comfort to the user. Such foams are not viscoelastic, and their structure essentially is destroyed on impact. Therefore, it is desirable to use semi-rigid protective foam pads that provide both comfort and energy-absorbing capabilities, and which are viscoelastic and recover (i.e. they re-expand to their pre-impacted shape) after impact.Current energy-absorbing pads used in combat helmets can be made, e.g., by encapsulating an acceleration rate sensitive material with a non-porous coating that traps air and to a degree prevents compression of the coated foam. Such a design is the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 6,467,099. However, this structure has several significant disadvantages. First, the coating material used to cover the pads is both expensive and difficult to apply. In order for the pad to effectively attenuate an impact force, the coating must remain substantially continuous, non-porous and free from perforation. This can be difficult to guarantee, especially during combat conditions when repeated impacts may be likely. Second, the coating is often a sprayed on solvent-based material, as in the preferred embodiment of U.S. Pat. No. 6,467,099, which provides minimal resistance to chemicals and solvent-based products, such as insect repellants, acetone, etc. that may be encountered in the field. Third, the process of applying such a solvent-based coating involves specialized equipment to capture the solvent vapors released when the coating is dried.An energy-absorbing pad structure is provided, which has an energy-absorbing viscoelastic foam pad and a perforated polymeric film encapsulating the foam pad. The perforated polymeric film is resistant to water penetration.An energy-absorbing pad structure also is provided, which has an energy-absorbing viscoelastic foam pad and a polymeric film layer encapsulating the foam pad. The polymeric film layer is resistant to water penetration but sufficiently air permeable to permit air that is expelled from the foam pad on rapid compression thereof to escape through the polymeric film layer to the ambient atmosphere.In the description that follows, when a preferred range such as 5 to 25 (or 5-25) is given, this means preferably at least 5 and, separately and independently, preferably not more than 25.With reference to , there is shown an embodiment of a pad structure  contemplated herein. A polymeric film  encapsulates an energy-absorbing pad , and a textile covering  encapsulates the energy-absorbing pad  and the polymeric film . As more fully described below the polymeric film  generally is provided as two opposing sheets or portions of film that are joined together around the perimeter of the pad  at seam , as seen more clearly in . The textile covering  likewise can be provided as two opposing sheets or portions that are joined together around the perimeter of the pad  as shown. An intermediate adhesive (shown schematically as layer , which has been exaggerated in the figures for clarity) can be applied to the surface of the pad  to adhere the polymeric film  to the pad . Alternatively, the polymeric film  can be adhered to the foam pad  without an adhesive, e.g. via heat bonding the polymeric film  to the pad  as further explained below. It is understood that the arrangement shown in  can include additional materials or layers arranged intermediate or adjacent the layers or components thereof, e.g. between polymeric film  and textile covering .To facilitate the following description, there is defined a top surface  of the energy absorbing pad , and a bottom surface  thereof. It is to be understood that there is not, necessarily, any physical difference between the opposite surfaces  and , as the pad can be made from a foam of substantially uniform composition. Rather, the distinction is made herein merely to aid the following description, where the top surface  in use will face away from the body part being protected (a head), and the bottom surface  will face toward the body part being protected. Also as referenced herein, the opposing sheets or portions of the polymeric film  and of the textile covering  sometimes are referred to, respectively, as top and bottom portions similarly as above depending on whether they are provided adjacent the top or bottom surface  or  of the pad . Each of the materials and components described above and shown in , as well as methods for providing and assembling them to provide the pad structure  shall now be described.The energy-absorbing pad  is a structure that can be placed over a body part in order to provide protection from an impact. One application of particular utility is to provide the pad structure  inside the outer shell of a sports or combat helmet in order to provide protection to the wearer's head from a dynamic or ballistic impact to the helmet shell. It is desirable that the pad  is compressible on impact to dissipate or consume at least a portion of the impact force. It is also desirable that the pad  be lightweight. Advantageously, the energy-absorbing pad  is made from foam, preferably a viscoelastic foam, and even more preferably a semi-rigid viscoelastic foam such as is disclosed in Published PCT patent application No. PCT/US2004/034596 (published as WO 2005/042611), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, the pad  can be made from a number of discrete foam layers wherein individual layers of foam are joined or otherwise laminated together to form the pad . The individual foam layers can be made from different foams, and there can be 2, 3, 4, or more foam layers in the construction of the foam pad . In one desirable embodiment, the pad  is made as a two-layer structure having a layer of high-modulus foam glued or joined to another layer of relatively low-modulus foam.Foams are lightweight and typically are compressible on impact, capable to absorb or dissipate at least a portion of the impact energy commensurate with the particular foam's rigidity and viscoelasticity. Additionally, in their uncompressed state, foams have a significant proportion of their volume composed of air, which occupies the cellular structure of the foam. The air within the foam provides an additional mode of energy absorption on impact based on the gas compressibility of air. Foams can be designed to be either open-celled or closed-celled in order to take advantage of different aspects of foam rigidity versus air permeability and entrapment within the cell structure to achieve different mechanisms of impact force attenuation as is understood in the art. The semi-rigid viscoelastic foam which is preferred for the energy-absorbing pad , e.g. as disclosed in Publication No. WO 2005/042611, can provide significant protection against dynamic impacts, such as from a ballistic impact against the outer shell of the helmet or other protective gear incorporating the pad structure , when situated between the outer shell and the wearer.For example, a semi-rigid viscoelastic polyurethane foam that is made from a significant proportion of propylene oxide-extended amine-based polyether polyols which contain substantially no ethylene oxide extension units, together with other filled and/or unfilled polyether polyol(s) as described in the aforementioned publication, as well as isocyanate (index 60-130) and appropriate catalysts, provides significant high speed dynamic impact protection to a significant degree comparable to rigid foams (e.g. expanded polystyrene). But such a foam nevertheless can be nondestructively deflected and will recover at a delayed rate following such deflection commensurate with the foam's viscoelasticity (its hysteresis function). This is unlike conventional rigid foams such as expanded polystyrene, which can provide adequate protection against high speed impacts, but which are destructively crushed and cannot recover or be reused. In addition, being a semi-rigid foam and not a rigid foam, the preferred foam for the pad  also provides a measure of protection against low-speed or even static or quasi-static impact forces, which cannot be matched by rigid foams such as expanded polystyrene. More specific details for such semi-rigid viscoelastic foams are provided in Publication WO 2005/042611, incorporated herein.Alternatively, the energy-absorbing pad  can be comprised of a multi-impact closed-cell foam such as closed-cell polyethylene foam, Insulate™ foam, plasticized closed-cell vinyl foam, closed-cell polypropylene foam, etc. These closed-cell foams are generally made in slab form and are blown or expanded into foam by an autoclave or extruder. In a further alternative, the energy absorbing pad  can be provided from any suitable material or foam that is known or conventional in the art for providing dynamic impact protection, although it is desirable that the material for pad  not be a rigid foam such as expanded polystyrene that will not recover following destructive deflection or “crush” on impact.The shape of the energy-absorbing pad  will depend on the particular application and may be, e.g., a rectangle, circle, trapezoid, etc., comprising a thickness of typically about or less than 2 inches for most body protecting applications. It is desirable that the shape of the pad  fit easily into a protective shell such as a helmet shell or other shell used in the various applications discussed below. In one embodiment, the pad  is approximately 3⅜ inches in length, 2 inches in width and ¾ of an inch in thickness. However, it is understood that the pad  can be any shape and should not be limited to the applications discussed herein.The energy-absorbing pad  is capable of absorbing and/or dissipating at least a portion of the energy of an impact. As noted above, a semi-rigid viscoelastic foam, desirably used for the pad , will provide significant protection against a high speed dynamic impact due to its substantial rigidity, but it also will recover and retain its rigidity following such impact so it may be reused. The compression and hysteretic (due to its viscoelastic structure) characteristics of such a foam dampen and disperse the force of a high-speed impact. The ability of pad  to recover after impact also gives it long-term use and durability, which is desired in athletic and combat equipment.A viscoelastic foam used for the pad  desirably will recover within the following guidelines following the referenced degree of compression: The time for the energy-absorbing pad  to substantially recover from a compression of 50% its original height is in the range of 3 seconds to 120 seconds. Substantial recovery of the energy-absorbing pad means recovery to at least 85, preferably 90, preferably 95, percent of the initial pre-compressed height following compression thereof. Further, it is desirable the pad  can recover from such a 50% compression to 80% of its pre-compressed height in the range of 2 seconds to 60 seconds, preferably 3 seconds to 30 seconds, and more preferably about 3 seconds to about 20 seconds. Following a 75% compression from its original height, the pad  should substantially recover in the range of 4 seconds to 240 seconds, and should recover to 80% of its pre-compressed height in the range of 3 seconds to 120 seconds, preferably 3 seconds to 90 seconds, and more preferably about 3 seconds to about 60 seconds.The polymeric film  can be an elastic and flexible film as known in the art, preferably that is capable of being fused or fusion bonded to form the seam  as described below. The polymeric film  can be any conventional or known polymeric film, such as a polyolefin film (e.g. polyethylene and/or polypropylene), polystyrene, polyester, urethane, polyurethane, aliphatic polyurethane, etc. The polymeric film  can also be made from any of the other well-known natural polymers such as cellulosic materials and/or other biopolymers (e.g. polylactic acid).Suitable film materials are available from Deerfield Urethane, Inc., South Deerfield, Mass., as Dureflex™ PT 9400S or Dureflex™ PT 6100S, which are flexible and elastic polyurethane films. These products are proprietary polyurethane films that have tear resistance greater than 500 pli, tensile strengths greater than 8000 psi and ultimate elongations greater than 500%. Other flexible polyurethane films also may be suitable for the polymeric film  herein, e.g., other polyurethane films available from Deerfield Urethane, Inc., Stevens Urethane, Easthampton, Mass., or from other commercial sources.As noted above, Dureflex™ PT 9400S and Dureflex™ PT6100S are proprietary compositions. The major component of these films is a polyurethane polyether elastomer.The polymeric film  encapsulates the energy-absorbing pad  to provide a durable, water and chemical resistant barrier around the pad . The polymeric film  prevents or substantially impedes the flow of liquids such as water to prevent or impede them from absorbing or penetrating into the energy-absorbing pad . For example, the polymeric film  shields the pad  from the wearer and thereby prevents the pad  from absorbing the perspiration generated by him/her, which otherwise may be absorbed by the pad , particularly if the pad is made from a cellular material such as foam. A pad  that has been saturated with water or perspiration is undesirable to a user because of the increased weight of the pad  and the overall reduction in comfort to the wearer. In addition, moisture in the pad  may adversely affect the pad's ability to absorb and/or dissipate energy from the force of an impact. For example, in the case of a viscoelastic foam the presence of moisture may alter the hysteresis function for the foam causing it to dissipate energy differently or to a different or lesser extent than the dry foam.In addition to providing a barrier that is resistant to water penetration, it is desirable that the polymeric film  also provides means for the discharge of air that is expelled from the foam's cellular structure upon an impact-induced compression of the foam pad . That is, the polymeric film  should be resistant to water penetration under ordinary conditions, but be or become sufficiently air permeable on a dynamic or ballistic impact or similar compression event to permit air expelled from the foam pad's cellular structure on compression thereof to escape the polymeric film . Otherwise, excess ballooning of the polymer film  also may adversely affect the energy-absorbing impact attenuation characteristics of pad . To provide the desired air permeability, the polymeric film  is perforated to provide a passage or passages through the film  for air that is expelled from the energy-absorbing pad  on impact to escape. The perforations (shown schematically at ) also allow the passage of air from the outside environment back into the pad  so the pad  can recover (i.e. expand or decompress to its original pre-impact shape) after the impact load is removed. Advantageously, the perforations  are designed so that they do not permit liquids such as water to penetrate the film  from the outside environment under normal conditions.It is also desirable that the perforations  provide some measure of air permeability through the film  even under non-impact conditions, such as due to changes in the ambient air pressure as may be encountered when climbing or descending in an airplane. Otherwise, if air were not permitted to escape the pad structure  through the perforations , the film  would tend to balloon on climbing as the ambient pressure decreased (or to shrink on descending as ambient pressure increased) in order to maintain constant pressure across the film . Because air is significantly less dense than water, the perforations  inherently will permit air to flow therethrough to a significantly greater degree than water, which in part is how the perforations present a desired degree of air permeability but nevertheless are able to maintain adequate water-penetration resistance. Thus, it will be recognized that while sufficiently small perforations can be provided through the film  so as to substantially inhibit or prevent the passage of water under normal conditions, they advantageously will permit the passage of air in response to a pressure gradient across the film .The substantially water-impermeable but air-permeable (at least during an impact) behavior of the perforations  provided in the polymeric film  can be understood and provided as follows. When very small perforations are made, e.g. using a needle point of very small diameter such as around 0.005 inches, the resulting perforations  are very small. The elastic character of the film  also will prevent expansion of the perforations  sufficiently so they do not substantially admit droplets of water, at least not from incidental water contact such as rain, and even under modest or moderate conditions of hydrostatic pressure, such as immersion within six inches or one foot of water, or more. However, on a dynamic compression event such as from a ballistic impact, the air expelled from the encapsulated foam pad  induces a pressure gradient across the film  relative to ambient atmospheric pressure, such that the perforations  expand against the elastic tendency of the film  to permit the air to escape, thus equalizing the pressure across the film . Once the impact load has been removed, the foam pad  will tend to return to its pre-compression shape based on its own viscoelastic character, thus generating a pressure gradient in the opposite direction across the film  to draw air back into the foam's cellular structure as it is re-expanding. Thus the foam's own tendency to re-expand induces a pressure gradient across the film  sufficient to draw air back in and re-fill the foam's cellular structure of air.Without perforations, the polymeric film  still may exhibit a measure of inherent gas (i.e. air) permeability based the material's porosity, but not enough to permit sufficient air passage through the film on rapid compression of the pad to avoid splitting the sealed seam  (discussed below) between the opposing sheets or portions of the polymeric film . (It should be evident that the inherent gas-permeability of a polymeric film, as a material property based on the film's porosity, is not the air-permeability that is referred to herein; air-permeability herein refers to a substantial measure of air penetrability through a polymeric film  resulting from perforations ). Furthermore, even if the seam  held, the rate of gas diffusion through the non-perforated polymeric film  would be so minimal that air expelled from the energy-absorbing pad  on rapid compression would be largely trapped by the film  causing it to balloon, and may prevent suitable physical compression or deformation of the pad  thus impeding or counteracting the pad's  energy-absorptive function. As a result, the desirable viscoelastic characteristics of the energy-absorbing pad  may be largely negated because of the trapped air in the non-perforated polymeric film .The perforations can be made with a needle point, preferably having a beveled point or end. The diameter of the needle point that penetrates the film  should be 0.001″ to 0.01″, preferably about 0.003″ to about 0.008″ and more preferably about 0.005″. The perforations can be made by passing the needle from the outside surface of the polymeric film  through the film  towards the pad . In this embodiment, the film  can be assembled to the pad  and then perforated, wherein the needle point(s) may extend somewhat into the underlying foam pad to a small degree before being withdrawn. This should not adversely affect the pad's function or structure. Otherwise, the perforations can be made by passing the needle from the pad  side of the polymeric film  through the film towards the outside, which would require the film  to be perforated prior to being assembled to the pad .It is preferred that the number of perforations in the polymeric film  is sufficient to allow the discharge of air upon a high speed impact as described above. The perforations are preferably spaced apart in order to form a grid pattern or array of perforations in the polymeric film . Accordingly, it is preferred that the spacing between adjacent perforations is in the range of 0.05-1, preferably 0.05-0.5, preferably 0.1-0.25, inches, and that the perforations are provided in a regular array of uniformly spaced perforations. To provide such an array of perforations, a corresponding array of needle points can be provided in a jig that is then pressed against the surface of the polymeric film  at an appropriate location such that the needle points are caused to penetrate the film  to provide the perforations. To further ensure that the elastic tendency of the film  will tend to hold the perforations closed against water penetration under ordinary conditions, it may be desirable to stretch the polymeric film  a small degree, such as at least or about 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, percent, or greater (such as at least 10, 15 or 20 percent), so that the film is in a stretched condition when the perforations are made. Then, following perforation of the film  it is allowed to relax back to its original un-stretched condition, and is provided to encapsulate the foam pad  in its un-stretched condition. As a result, the elasticity of the polymeric film  will strongly tend to contract the perforations under normal conditions, and even against a modest or potentially a moderate pressure gradient. However, on rapid or ballistic compression of the foam pad  encapsulated within the polymeric film , air is expelled from the foam at a sufficient rate so that the resulting pressure gradient counteracts the contractile tendency of the film  so that the air can escape through the perforations.In one embodiment, only the top portion of the encapsulating polymeric film  (facing away from the user's body in use) is perforated. Alternatively, both the top and bottom portions can be perforated, or only the bottom portion.In a further embodiment, the top and/or bottom portion(s) of the polymeric film  can consist of one ply or of multiple plies of polymeric film material. For example, the top portion of the polymeric film, overlying the entire top surface  of the energy-absorbing pad , can be one or more plies of polymeric film material. The bottom portion of the film  overlying the entire bottom surface  also can be similarly provided having one or more plies of polymeric film material. Multiple plies of polymeric film material can be used to achieve an overall thickness for the polymeric film  that is desired in a given application, and/or to control or regulate the rate of air expulsion from a dynamic impact event based on empirical testing. For example, the top portion of the polymeric film  can include a plurality of plies or layers of polymeric material, while the bottom portion of the polymeric film is provided having only one layer or ply. In this embodiment, it is desirable that only the top portion (consisting of a plurality, such as three, plies) be perforated, while the single-ply bottom portion of the polymeric film  remains non-perforated.The thickness of the top portion of the polymeric film  can be made greater than that of the bottom portion thereof, either by using more plies for the top portion as described above, or by using a thicker film for the top portion than for the bottom portion. In one embodiment, the top portion of the polymeric film  has a thickness in the range of 2 mils to 15 mils, preferably from 2 mils to 10 mils, and more preferably from about 2 mils to about 5 mils, and the bottom portion has a thickness in the range of 1 mils to 15 mils, preferably from 1 mils to 10 mils, and more preferably from about 1 mils to about 5 mils.Optionally an intermediate adhesive layer  (shown exaggerated in the figures) can be applied to the surfaces  and/or  of the pad  to adhere the opposing portions or sheets of the encapsulating polymeric film  thereto. The adhesive layer  is applied to the surface of the energy-absorbing pad , and adheres the polymeric film  to the pad  thereby helping to prevent the polymeric film  from crinkling, shifting or sliding over the surface of the pad  during use. The intermediate adhesive layer  can comprise, but is not limited to, an adhesive paste or cement, adhesive fusible webbing or a no-sew bond fabric as known in the textile and crafts arts. If it is a webbing or bond fabric, the intermediate adhesive layer  can be attached or held onto the surface of the energy-absorbing pad  by a semi-liquid or a gel material, Vaseline, grease, oil or glycerin, prior to affixing the polymeric film  sheet. In the alternative, the intermediate adhesive layer  can directly overlie the surface of the energy-absorbing pad  without an intermediate semi-liquid or gel. Furthermore, the intermediate adhesive layer  can be applied to the surface of the energy-absorbing pad  by any conventional method known in the art.In a further embodiment, the polymeric film  can be adhered directly to the surface of the pad  via heat bonding, with no intermediate adhesive layer. In this method, the polymeric film  (such as a polyurethane film) is heated to just above its softening point (or melting point) and brought into contact with the surface of the foam pad  before it is then allowed to cool back down to ambient temperature. The result is that the polymeric film  is heat-bonded to the surface of the foam pad  by being melded thereto in the softened or partially melted state before being cooled to re-solidify the film . Methods for heat-bonding polymeric films to various substrates are known in the art, and will not be further described here.The textile covering  also can be considered optional. This covering  is provided to encapsulate the polymeric film  and provide comfort to the wearer, as well as in some applications a means for securing the pad structure  to the inner surface of an outer shell for protective gear. For example, at least the top portion of the textile covering  can be provided as a high-pile fabric that can be secured to the inner surface of a protective shell, such as a helmet or kneepad shell, via a hook-and-pile fastener mechanism such as Velcro. In addition, the bottom portion of the textile covering  can be provided from a sewn or porous fabric material that is effective to absorb and wick moisture, such as perspiration, away from the wearer's underlying body part that may be in contact with the bottom portion of the textile covering  during use.In one desirable embodiment, the bottom portion of the textile covering  is composed of a material capable of wicking moisture away from a surface as described above, and the top portion of the textile covering  is a fabric of sufficient pile to be readily retained by “hook” fasteners extending from the surface to which the pad structure  is to be adhered, such as a pile fabric of a conventional Velcro or similar fastening system. For example, in this manner the pad structure  can be easily secured to the inside of a protective shell for a helmet where the “hook” fabric has been previously attached or adhered. The textile covering  can also be comprised of any fabric, woven material or textile material conventionally known in the art, and can be provided for any one or all of the foregoing purposes, in addition to any one or all of the following: aesthetic appearance, comfort, marketability or merchandisability, printability, etc.It is preferred, though not required, that the textile covering  is not physically bonded to the polymeric film  over a significant portion of their respective surfaces in the pad structure . That is, the two materials ,  are not laminated together. In the alternative, the polymeric film  can be laminated, e.g. by heat or flame techniques, to the textile covering .In the embodiment illustrated in , the polymeric film  is provided by joining top and bottom portions of polymeric film material around the perimeter of the energy-absorbing pad  to form a seam  therearound. Also in that embodiment, the top and bottom portions of the textile covering  also are joined together at the seam  to provide the illustrated structure, wherein the pad  is encapsulated within the polymeric film , which is encapsulated within the textile covering . This construction can be made as follows.A method for producing an energy absorbing pad structure  is illustrated schematically in . First referring to , the energy-absorbing pad  is positioned having a first web of polymeric film material  overlying the top surface  and a second web of polymeric film material  underlying the bottom surface  of the pad . It is to be noted that reference here to “top” and “bottom” as well as “first” and “second” is merely for convenience; the pad  might just as easily be oriented vertically during assembly instead of horizontally as illustrated, in which case the first and second webs  and  might be referred to as “left” and “right,” respectively. Continuing, a first textile material web  is positioned above the first polymeric film material web , opposite the pad , and a second textile material web  is positioned below the second polymeric film material web , opposite the pad .A sealing die  is provided having opposed reciprocating members oppositely provided over and under, respectively, the first and second textile and polymeric webs (-) with the pad  located centrally in-between as shown. The reciprocating members have cooperating die-pressing faces  which are arranged such that when the reciprocating members are closed, the opposing faces  are pressed together along a pathway around the perimeter of the energy-absorbing pad  as seen inWhen the members of the sealing die  are closed (), the four webs (first and second polymeric film and textile webs -) are pressed together along the pathway of the die-pressing surfaces . The die members are equipped to heat the portions of the webs in contact with the die-pressing surfaces  around the perimeter of the pad  such that polymeric material webs  and  are caused to at least partially soften or melt, thus being joined together to form the seam  shown in  and as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Simultaneously, the textile material webs  and , which are in contact with the softened/melted portions of the polymeric webs along the pathway of the contacting surfaces , are permeated with and absorb a portion of the polymeric material such that when that material re-hardens or solidifies, the effect is to join all four webs at the seam  as will be understood.For convenience, the process of  is illustrated schematically only for a single pad . However, it will be understood to persons having ordinary skill in the art that a plurality, such as an array, of pads  could be arranged in a die having a cookie-cutter die-pressing surface  pattern designed to accommodate an array of pads . Subsequent to the heat-sealing step, the die members can be opened and the newly made pad structure  (or array of such structures ) can be conveyed to a die-cutting station (not shown) where a cutting die can be used to free each pad structure  from the extraneous material webs by stamping.In addition to heat-sealing using conventional heating methods, the energy to soften or melt the polymeric webs  and  can be supplied via a radio frequency method. In such a method, the reciprocating members of the die  are closed around the pad  along a pathway in contact with the material webs as before, and a radio frequency is applied to the die, thereby transmitting radio waves through the polymeric film material webs  and  as they are compressed together around the perimeter of the pad . The radio waves excite the molecules of the polymeric film sheets to generate sufficient heat to effectively soften or melt or seal (i.e. physically bond the layers together) the compressed polymeric film material webs together to form the polymeric film layer  around the pad . The methods and machinery for carrying out radio frequency sealing are known or conventional in the art. A person having ordinary skill in the art could make the selection of appropriate devices and radio frequencies for a particular polymeric film. In the alternative, other conventional heating methods can be used for applying heat to the polymeric sheets compressed in the die.In a further alternative embodiment (not illustrated), the textile covering  can be provided around the polymeric film  by sewing or otherwise sealing the opposing textile fabric layers or webs together separately from the seam  made between the opposing polymeric film material webs.In a still further alternative embodiment, the polymeric film  can be provided by sewing the opposing polymeric film material webs together to provide the seam  around the energy-absorbing pad . In this construction, the seam  of the polymeric film  will not be air tight, and will include small openings between the opposing film portions which may provide sufficient air permeability to obviate the need of the perforations  discussed above. It is contemplated, however, that the polymeric film sheets could be sewn together sufficiently tightly, or using a small enough stitch that the polymeric film  still would present adequate water impermeability under most ordinary conditions where water may be encountered. Sewing together the polymeric film portions may be less desirable because of the increased production costs. Furthermore, sewing together the polymeric film sheets may be less reliable than other methods as those described above.Other alternatives for sealing or bonding the polymeric film sheets together can include gluing to create the desired seam . Conventional glues or epoxy sealants well known in the art can be used to seal or bond the top and bottom polymeric film portions together to form seam .The energy-absorbing pad  can be a foam that is formed integrally to the polymeric film layer . In this embodiment, the pad  can be prepared by molding a foam in a mold wherein polymeric film material has been used to coat the interior wall surfaces of the molding chamber. As the foaming composition (mixture of polyols and isocyanate for a polyurethane foam) rises or foams, it will come into contact with the polymeric film material coating or lining the interior walls of the mold. The foam is permitted to cure such that it cures and forms directly to the polymeric film material so that the resulting construction is of pad  having an integrally formed polymeric film  directly on the surface thereof.In another embodiment, the polymeric film  can be provided onto the surface of the energy-absorbing pad  as a chemically deposited layer that is applied directly on the surface of the pad  and then allowed or caused to dry or cure to form a water resistant polymeric film. The chemically deposited layer can be provided as an elastomeric coating material that is not yet cured. The elastomeric material can be a thermoset powder coating composition that cures when exposed to heat, less preferably to a combination of heat and radiation. The elastomeric material can be deposited on the pad  by any of the well-known or conventional methods such as spraying, brushing, dipping, etc., depending on the state and the viscosity (atomizability) of the coating material. The elastomeric coating can be sprayed on the pad  as a thermoset solvent-release liquid or a thermoset powder. Once the elastomeric coating material is applied over the pad , it is heated to a temperature sufficient to cure and crosslink the elastomer. Once cured, the elastomeric material effectively encapsulates the pad  as a coating on its surface.It will be understood that in many of the above-described alternative modes of applying a polymeric film , it may be necessary to perforate that film to provide the perforations  after the film  has been formed around or onto the pad  to provide the desired air-permeability.It will be further understood that if the polymeric film  is to consist of multiple plies of polymeric material on one or both sides of the pad , it may be necessary to adjust the heating/radio frequency time for one of the heat-sealing modes, or otherwise to take this into consideration when effecting a seal such as a seam  or other closure method such as sewing.Optionally, as shown in  an additional layer of energy-absorbing material  can be positioned adjacent the top and/or bottom surface(s)  and/or  of the pad  in between the associated portions of the polymeric film and textile covering layers  and . Such a layer(s) if present can be made from the semi-rigid viscoelastic foam described above for the pad , and may provide an additional impediment to the penetration of moisture into the main energy absorbing pad , e.g. in the unlikely event of a submersion of extended duration or significant depth. In addition, when placed adjacent the bottom surface  of the pad , such additional foam layer may provide additional comfort or cushioning benefits to the wearer, particularly when used in a helmet that is worn for extended periods. In this embodiment, however, when the layer  is intended as a comfort foam to be positioned adjacent the bottom surface  of the pad , it may be preferable to use a soft, flexible foam instead of a semi-rigid viscoelastic foam for the layer .The pad structure  described herein can be used in various applications and protective gear including, but not limited to, safety equipment, combat helmets, athletic helmets, sporting equipment, kneepads, elbow pads, etc. Because the pad structure  effectively absorbs the force on an impact, its use can be applied broadly to any application in which it is desirable to protect body parts or equipment, such as electronics, tools, etc. It is even contemplated the pad structures described herein can be used as packing materials for shipment of goods where it is desired to provide protection against a high-speed dynamic impact while in transit.Further aspects of the invention will become evident through reference to the following example, which is provided by way of illustration and not limitation.A semi-rigid viscoelastic foam pad measuring nominally 3⅜″×2″×¾″ was encapsulated within a polyurethane film having nominally the same dimensions as applied. The polyurethane film was composed of Dureflex™ PT9400S supplied by on one side of the foam pad, and Dureflex™ PT6100S on the other side, which films were joined together around the perimeter of the pad as further explained below. The encapsulated pad was further enclosed within a textile covering, one side of which was made from a pile fabric similar to a Velcro and the other side of which was made from a wicking fabric such as a cotton fabric. To prepare this construction, one ply of Dureflex™ PT9400S polyurethane film, 5 mil thick, one ply of Dureflex™ PT6100S, 2 mils thick, one ply of Velcro pile fabric and one ply of wicking fabric were die cut to oversized dimensions relative to the pad. The polyurethane film, Velcro and wicking fabric sheets then were then perforated using a 0.005″ diameter beveled-point needle. The perforations were made by penetrating in the direction from the surface that was to face away from the pad, through the layers and toward the surface that was to face the pad. The perforations were spaced about ½″ apart in the layers.Then the layers were arranged with the foam pad in a die cavity as follows: the wicking fabric was positioned in the bottom of the die cavity, one ply of 2 mil thick polyurethane film was placed on top of the wicking fabric, the pad was placed on top of the first ply of polyurethane film, one ply of 5 mil thick polyurethane film were placed on top of the pad, and the Velcro pile fabric was placed on top of the construction. A radio frequency was applied to the die, and then the die was clamped shut around the layered construction similarly as illustrated in to compress the plies of polyurethane film, the wicking fabric and the Velcro fabric together along a pathway around the perimeter of the foam pad. The compressed layers were heated via the radio frequency for a period of up to 5 seconds to create an airtight seal around the perimeter of the pad. The resulting pad structure was removed from the die and extraneous material outside the newly formed seal was cut away.The encapsulated pad (with the fabric removed) was then weighed to the nearest 0.01 gram prior to being submerged to a depth of six inches in a 25° C. water bath. The encapsulated pad was submerged for a period of 24 hours, after which the encapsulated pad was removed from the water bath and towel dried. The encapsulated pad was then placed on a rack to dry at ambient temperature for 24 hours. After drying, the pads were weighed to the nearest 0.01 gram. The initial weight was deducted from the final weight to determine the weight of water absorbed by the pad. The final weight of the pad was less than 1% greater then that initially measured (i.e. prior to submerging in the water bath). Hence, the perforations in the polymeric film plies did not substantially adversely affect the water impenetrability of that film measured according to the conditions of the test, which were intended to be more stringent (in terms of water contact) than a typical piece of protective gear might encounter in ordinary sport or combat applicationsAlthough the above-described embodiments constitute the preferred embodiments, it will be understood that various changes or modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention as set forth in the appended claims."

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.The present invention relates in general to safety helmets, and more particularly to a triple locking, bi-hemispheric safety helmet which provides a simple method of removal of the safety helmet from the head of a victim after an accident.Motorcycles are inherently more dangerous than cars. Per km traveled, the number of deaths on motorcycles is about 14 times the number in cars. Motorcycles often have excessive performance capabilities, including rapid acceleration and high top speed. They are less stable than cars in emergency braking and less visible. Motorcyclists are more prone to crash injuries than car drivers because motorcycles are not enclosed, leaving the rider vulnerable to contact with the hard road surface. Therefore, wearing a helmet is important, as helmets are the principal countermeasure for reducing crash-related head injuries, the leading cause of death among unhelmeted riders.The Michigan State Police claim that “Helmets decrease the severity of injury, the likelihood of death, and the overall cost of medical care. They are designed to cushion and protect riders' heads from the impact of a crash. Just like safety belts in cars, helmets can't provide total protection against head injury or death, but they do reduce the incidence of both.” (Cited from http://wmoon.wordpress.com)When a victim has endured an accident, there is a high likelihood of sever neck and brain trauma. One primary concern of motorcycle riders is that of the removal of the safety helmet and not knowing if the victim has sustained this injury. The current method of removal the direct pulling-off of the helmet. This extreme measure results in additional disturbance to a potentially already damaged neck/brain, causing paralysis or even death to the victim.There are several helmets designed to prevent traumatic brain injuries, during a crash. Conventional head gear requires a saw like device to cut the helmet off the head, or the helmet is simply pulled off the head. One such device is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,138,283 to Kress on Oct. 31, 2000. The device is a multiple-piece removable helmet which can be disassembled on the wearer's head so that, in the event of a medical emergency, the front portion can be removed to afford access to the face of the wearer for administration of first aid and to facilitate the diagnosis of the extent of the injury. A neck brace can also be attached and the injured can be lifted out of the back portion of the helmet. The apparatus for attaching the removable halves includes, in various embodiments, screws, adjustable tension cables, buckles, and spring fingers on one half engaging in indentations in the other with the fingers being secured in place by screws.A number of other safety helmets are known in the art which can be pulled off the head without using a tool. An example of such devices includes U.S. Pat. No. 7,096,513 issued to Kress which describes a protective helmet with an emergency removal feature. The protective helmet is a multi-piece helmet for protecting the head region of a wearer and providing emergency removal wherein the helmet shell is provided in separate front and rear portions along a seam. A securing mechanism extends between the helmet portions and holds them together in a releaseable manner. The securing mechanism is positioned on the interior surfaces of the helmet shell and finger access ports are provided in the helmet to allow finger access to the securing mechanism from the exterior surfaces of the helmet. This enables the securing mechanism to be finger manipulated to release the securing mechanism and completely separate the front helmet shell portion from the rear helmet shell portion without the requirement of a tool.Another prior art, U.S. Pat. No. 6,418,564 issued to Sheridan on Jul. 16, 2002, discloses a two piece helmet with optional airbag that is split along a vertical axis between the sides of the helmet to ease removal in the event of an injury. A series of aligned orifices in the helmet portions are joined by a removable cable. The cable ends are attached to each other to secure the helmet portions or to each of the helmet portions. The cable is accessed through removable panels that may also be used to tension the cable. Alternate means for joining the helmet portions include a series of lateral exterior latches opened by the cable. The helmet liner has two overlapping portions to minimize noise and improve weather sealing. An optional inflatable air bag is fitted to a lower perimeter of the helmet. A proximity sensing system inflates the airbag when the vehicle is in motion and the helmet is displaced a certain distance from the vehicle.Most of the devices have significant disadvantages. One of the above devices requires the use of a tool to gain access to the latching mechanisms. So, the people attending the injured person must always carry the required tool with them. This further complicates and extends the time for effecting helmet separation and removal as the tool must first be retrieved, if available. Moreover, due to the relative complexity of the assembly of some of the above devices, it is time-consuming to dismantle the entire helmet from the head of a victim after an accident. Some other devices require insertion of the finger through the finger access ports provided in the helmet shell to manipulate the securing means positioned on the interior surfaces of the helmet shell. This can perplex would-be rescuers and extend the time for effecting helmet separation and removal.It is therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a simple, safe apparatus for preventing injury to the head of a motorcycle passenger due to impact/trauma. Another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus that can be dismantled from the head of a victim after an accident thereby providing a simple method of removal and preventing further movement of the head and neck. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a safety helmet having two hemisphere parts fastened at the center with latch-like locks and a removable face shield fastened to the sides of the helmet. Other objects of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the appended Summary, Description and Claims.The present invention is a safety helmet designed to protect a head of motorcycle/bicycle users, sports athletes, military troops, law enforcement, and/or heavy machinery operators due to impact/trauma and to provide emergency removal after an accident.

                "This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/398,908, filed Jul. 2, 2010, the content of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.Not applicable.Not applicable.1. FieldThe invention relates to a system for sanitizing a toilet bowl plunger after use in flushing a toilet.2. Description of Relating Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 C.F.R. 1.97 and 1.98Toilet bowl plungers for flushing a toilet bowl to remove obstructions and clogging are well known. Such obstructions prevent water in the bowl from being flushed from the toilet bowl through the drain pipes into the sewage system.Typically, such plungers include an elongated handle with an inverted cap-shaped plunger portion, generally of rubber or other resilient material, connected to an end of the handle. In order to plunge a clogged toilet bowl, the plunger portion is placed over the opening at the bottom of the bowl and pushed downwardly. The walls of the plunger portion collapse and force air under pressure through the opening. The plunger handle is pulled upwardly to release the plunger portion and restore it to its initial position. This applied suction usually dislodges any obstructions in the bowl and the bowl trap.The plunger portion, and the lower part of the plunger handle, thus comes into contact with unsanitary material in the bowl. Rinsing the plunger portion in the now clean water in the bowl does not disinfect the plunger portion.The above-mentioned features and objects of the present disclosure will become more apparent with reference to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals denote like elements and in which:It is an object of this invention to provide a system for disinfecting a plunger after flushing a toilet.It is a further object of this invention to provide a system for quickly and easily applying a disinfecting solution about the lower part of the handle of a plunger and about the plunger head or portion and into the bowl after flushing.These and other objects are preferably accomplished by providing a hollow chamber in the handle of a plunger for filling the same with a cleaning fluid. The handle has a plurality of normally closed apertures communicating with the interior of the chamber. A lever on the handle is activated to open the apertures and allow the cleaning fluid to flow out of the apertures down about the outside of the lower portion of the handle, over the plunger portion and into the toilet bowl.After such cleaning treatment, the plunger portion can be placed in a pail or bucket for drying. A disposable bag, such as a plastic bag, may be placed in the pail or bucket for retaining any solution dripping off the plunger.Referring now to  of the drawing, a plunger system  in accordance with the teachings of the invention is shown. Plunger system  includes an elongated handle , which may be plastic, metal or wood, or any suitable material, having a threaded portion  at its lower end threaded into a threaded aperture  in the top of a conventional plunger portion or head . Plunger head  may be of rubber or any suitable resilient material having an inner cup configuration  as is well known in the art and open at bottom . Various types of such heads are known and any suitable head may be used. In fact, handle  may be removed from head  and threaded to a replacement plunger head as is also well known in the art.As particularly contemplated in the invention, and best seen in , the interior of handle  is hollow forming an internal chamber . Access to chamber  is provided through a removable cap  at the upper end of handle  which can be threaded thereon as seen at threads  on cap  mating with thread  at the upper end of handle . A reciprocating cylinder  is provided in chamber above the threaded end  ().Cylinder  () is hollow on its interior and slides along the inner wall of chamber . Cylinder  has a bottom wall  and is open at top . Cylinder  also has a chamber  communicating with the exterior of cylinder  closed off by inner wall  and upper and lower wall portions ,  integral with inner wall  forming the chamber .Handle  has a slot  having a first elongated portion  of a lever  disposed therein. Lever  also has a second elongated portion  extending into chamber , pivotally connected to first elongated portion , at pivot  connected to handle . The normal position of lever  is shown in .A plurality of openings or holes  (see also ) are provided about the periphery of handle , below slot , communicating the exterior of handle  with the interior thereof. As seen in , the wall of cylinder  normally blocks openings or holes , when cylinder  is in the  position, so no fluid therein can exit out of holes .The lower end of cylinder  has spaced peripheral holes  fluidly communicating with holes  when cylinder  is in the  position. Just above and below openings  are provided resilient o-rings ,, respectively, in grooves , , respectively, for providing a seal between cylinder  and the inner wall of chamber  of handle .In operation, cap  can be removed and chamber  filled with a suitable cleaning fluid. The cap  is then replaced. As seen in , holes  normally communicate with the interior of chamber  but, as seen, are blocked by cylinder  in the  position.As seen in , when lever  is activated by pulling portion  outwardly, portion  engages wall  to lift cylinder  aligning holes  and . Fluid  exits out of holes  flowing down the lower part of handle , over the plunger portion , and into the fluid into the toilet bowl  shown in . This disinfects the lower portion of handle  and plunger portion  and also injects the cleaning fluid, which may be any suitable sanitizing fluid, into the toilet bowl . Bowl  may now be flushed and the plunger  placed inside of a disposable plastic bag  in pail or bucket  as seen in . A removable sponge  may be disposed in the bottom of bucket  for absorbing water from the plunger .It can be seen that there is disclosed a plunger cleaning system where the hollow interior of the handle of the plunger can be filled with a cleaning fluid and a lever activated to open holes in the handle to disperse the fluid. Any suitable operating system may be used to release the fluid. Thus, the toilet plunger cleaning system disclosed herein keeps the toilet bowl plunger clean without having to carry it across the floor to the sink or tub. The plunger has a hollow handle that has refillable antiseptic cleaning solution in it such as a bleaching fluid. Once the toilet is plunged, it is flushed and rinsed in the clean water. One pushes on the lever which will release the cleaning solution into the bowl, around the bottom half of the handle and around the plunger. The holes through which the solution may be about 5 inches or so above the bottom of the plunger portion so that the toilet water does not have a chance to go back in where the liquid comes out and the bottom of the handle is cleaned. A bucket or the like may be provided to put the plunger when finished. Such a bucket may be lined with a disposable plastic liner or have a sponge at bottom to allow the plunger head to dry.Any suitable plunger head may be used. The handle  herein may be about 17″ long, 1″ in diameter and adapted to thread into a conventional plunger head. Such heads are generally about 4″ in height and 6″ in diameter, open at bottom and have a threaded socket at top.Gravity would be sufficient to allow flow of water out of the aligned holes. However, if desired, any suitable means may be provided for ejecting fluid under pressure out of the aligned holes.While the system has been described in a particular embodiment, various thereof may occur to an artisan and the scope of the invention should only be limited by the scope of the appended claims."

Both buildings ,  are equipped with substantially horizontal pipes disposed within the floors and or ceilings and are in fluid communication with toilets , tubs, washing machines , dishwashers, sinks and other facilities that expel waste into the sewer system. An auger  in the horizontal pipes  moves sewage in a generally horizontal fashion within the floor from one end of the pipe to another end, where it is dumped into shared pipes  located is a utility space  between the buildings which direct the sewage to an anaerobic digester . The anaerobic digester  uses micro-organisms to break down the sewage and turn it into CO2, methane, and soil nutrients. Preferably the products of the anaerobic digester are re-used in the vicinity of the buildings such as in gardens or powering machines and vehicles. The auger  allows a horizontal pipe to be used in the sewer system which allows for thinner floors since traditionally the sewer system incorporate a sloped pipe or drain to transport the sewage. The thinner floors give more freedom to building designers and save on material costs.is a cross-sectional diagram of an embodiment of a building . The building  may comprise at least one floor  and at least one generally vertical vent pipe . The at least one generally vertical vent pipe  may be disposed within a wall  of the building .

The auger  may be driven by an electric motor  which may be disposed outside of the toilet. In some embodiments, a digestion chemical may be injected when the auger  is activated. This allows the waste or sewage to begin to be broken up almost immediately after the waste is removed from the bowl of the toilet . The auger  may be driven by an electric motor, which may be disposed outside of the toilet  although in some embodiments the motor  may be incorporated into the toilet .The auger described in  may also be adapted to suck the waste out of the bowl of the toilet. Such a system has several advantages. Since the removal of the waste depends on the sucking motion of the auger, the amount of water traditionally used in flushing toilets is now no longer required. This saves water and reduces the noise of flushing. Also with this system, since the amount of water required is greatly reduced the sewage will be more concentrated allowing for easier digestion. In some embodiments, the sewage is brought directly into a digestion processor such as an anaerobic digestion system. The auger may also provide the benefit of breaking down the sewage while it is being transported to the processor which will speed up the digestion process. In some embodiments a digestion chemical will be injected into the sewage system, the fluid pathway or the bowl as the auger is activated to start the digestion process as early as possible.In some aspects of the invention, a method for disposing of human waste comprises the step of sucking the waste out of a bowl of a toilet by activating an electrically controlled auger disposed in a fluid pathway connecting the bowl to a sewer system. The method may also include the step of injecting a digestion chemical into the bowl or sewer system when the auger is activated. The method may also include the step of activating the auger by pressing a button, pushing a handle or activating a motion sensor.Whereas the present invention has been described in particular relation to the drawings attached hereto, it should be understood that other and further modifications apart from those shown or suggested herein, may be made within the scope and spirit of the present invention."

                "This application claims the benefit of Chinese Patent Application No. 201010226815.3 filed Jun. 30, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.The embodiments described herein relate to the field of medical imaging equipment, especially to a magnetic resonance (MR) system, and particularly to a mechanical structure for driving and supporting cradle.As shown in , a MR system usually includes a table (), a magnet () and a rear pedestal (). The table () is movable in forward and reverse and can move up and down. A cradle () on the table can move relative to the table so as to carry a patient into the magnet bore. When a front part of the cradle passes through the magnet bore and moves out of the magnet bore, a bridge () supports the front part of the cradle. The rear pedestal includes a cradle supporting element () and a drive motor (). The drive motor drives the cradle supporting element to provide support to the protruding cradle when the cradle passes though and protrudes from the magnet bore.Such known structure has the following problems. Because the table must be movable and can move up and down, the whole cradle (front part and rear part) tightly fits within the magnet bore, and thus it is difficult to realize a longer scanning range. Besides, in an emergency (e.g. when the system is out of power), the cradle inserted into the magnet bore cannot be withdraw immediately. Instead, the cradle can only be pulled out of the magnet bore by an operator manually. Moreover, the rear pedestal requires a rather large room, and thus the MR system is required to be housed in a large scanning room. As such, a facility to perform operations, such as surgical procedure, while performing MR scanning may be difficult to obtain.The rear pedestal mainly has two functions. First, the rear pedestal forms a support for the cradle moving into the magnet bore so as to reduce cradle sag. The read pedestal further drives the movement of the cradle. Therefore, a new structural for driving and supporting cradle is described below to remove the rear pedestal. The embodiments described herein are further configured to realize a longer scanning range and to ensure timely release of the cradle in case of emergencies.U.S. Pat. No. 7,430,772 discloses a single-cradle driving and supporting mechanism realized with three toothed racks. However, the single-cradle limits the scanning range, the cost of the structure of three toothed racks is high, and the control precision thereof is low. Further, U.S. Pub. No. 2007/0143921 discloses a double-cradle driving and supporting structure realized with a double belt pulley. However, the table cannot move freely to ensure safety since the drive motor is located on the table base.In one aspect, an apparatus for driving and supporting mechanism includes a table base and a cradle movable on the table base. The cradle includes two layers, and the table base is connected to an intermediate cradle through a rack and gear structure. The intermediate cradle is movable relative to the table base and connected to an upper cradle through a rack and gear structure.

The motor drives the pulleys and the belt, which drives the cradle supporting layer to move on the bridge.A hook is provided on the outer side of the intermediate cradle in the same direction as the moving direction thereof A hook is provided on the outer side of the side of the cradle supporting layer close to the cradle. When the cradle supporting layer moves to the side of the intermediate cradle, the hook on the outer side of the cradle supporting layer hooks on to the hook on the outer side of the intermediate cradle.In another aspect, a magnetic resonance system includes a table and a magnet part. The table includes a table base and a cradle movable on the table. The cradle has two layers. The table base is connected to the intermediate cradle through a rack and gear structure, and the intermediate cradle can move relative to the table base. The intermediate cradle is connected to the upper cradle through a rack and gear structure, and the upper cradle can move relative to the intermediate cradle.A rack is fixed on the upper cradle, and a first gear is fixed on the intermediate cradle. The rack on the upper cradle is engaged with the first gear on the intermediate cradle. When the intermediate cradle moves, the first gear rotates and drives the upper cradle to move by the rack. A second gear is fixed on the intermediate cradle, and a rack is fixed on the table base. The rack on the table is engaged with the second gear on the intermediate cradle, and the movement of the intermediate cradle drives the second gear to rotate and moves relative to the table base through the gear and rack connection.The first and second gears on the intermediate cradle are located at the two sides of the intermediate cradle, respectively. The first and second gears each have a coaxial pulley, and the two pulleys are connected through a belt. The belt links the two pulleys, and the pulleys drive the two gears. The two racks-two gears structure drives the upper cradle and the intermediate cradle to move in the same direction.The first and second gears have the same radius, and the two pulleys have the same number of teeth.A handle is provided on the outer side of the intermediate cradle opposite to the moving direction thereofA cradle supporting part separate from the table is further included. When a part of the cradle moves out of the table, the cradle supporting part supports the part of cradle.The cradle supporting part includes a bridge and a cradle supporting layer, wherein the cradle supporting layer can move on the bridge and provides support below the moving cradle.A motor is provided at a side of the bridge beyond the influence range of the magnet bore. A gearing is further included, and the motor is connected to the gearing, which is in turn connected to the cradle supporting layer.The gearing includes pulleys and a belt. The motor drives the pulleys and the belt, which drives the cradle supporting layer to move on the bridge.A hook is provided on the outer side of the intermediate cradle in the same direction as the moving direction thereof A hook is provided on the outer side of the side of the cradle supporting layer close to the cradle. When the cradle supporting layer moves to the side of the intermediate cradle, the hook on the outer side of the cradle supporting layer hooks on to the hook on the outer side of the intermediate cradle.The embodiments described herein realize a longer scanning range by using double cradles, lowers the requirement on the space of a scan room, and facilitates a doctor to perform surgical procedures at the position usually occupied by the rear pedestal and thereby simplifies the system. The apparatus for driving and supporting cradle can ensure free movement of the table and reduce cradle sag during movement and ensure the safety in emergencies in the meanwhile.The present invention is further explained in detail below by embodiments of the present invention, but the present invention is not limited thereto.The embodiments described herein provide a double-cradle structure. More specifically, a cradle supporting layer is added on the bridge for supporting an upper cradle extending into the magnet bore. A drive motor is located at a side of the bridge and a rear pedestal is omitted. The drive motor drives the cradle supporting layer to move using belt pulleys. The cradle supporting layer hooks onto the intermediate cradle by using a hook and drives the intermediate cradle to move. The intermediate cradle drives the upper cradle to be inserted into the magnet bore through the connection and driving between the intermediate cradle and the upper cradle.Embodiments in accordance with the present invention are described in detail below in connection with the drawings, but the embodiments are not intended to limit the present invention, wherein the same component parts in different drawings are indicated with the same reference number.shows the structural diagram of a MR system according to the present invention. As shown in , a MR system includes a table () and a magnet bore (). The table contacts a connection part () when moving to a side of the magnet bore. Two layers of cradles are provided on the table base, namely, an intermediate cradle () and an upper cradle (). A bridge () is provided in the magnet bore, and a cradle supporting layer () is positioned on the bridge. The rear pedestal is omitted from a first side of the magnet bore where a rear pedestal is positioned in a known MR system. A drive motor () is positioned immediately next to the bridge in the lower part of the first side and beyond the influence of the magnet bore. The motor drives the cradle supporting layer () to move using a gearing (). The gearing includes pulleys and a belt. The cradle supporting layer couples to the hook () on the intermediate cradle () near the cradle supporting layer using a hook () near the side of the cradle. The coupling drives the intermediate cradle to move. Further, a handle () is included on the intermediate cradle. In emergencies, for example, a power-down of the system, the hooks between the intermediate cradle and the cradle supporting layer can be disconnected by simply manually pulling to release the cradle. With this structure, the drive motor is located at the side of the magnet bore immediately next to the bridge and beyond the influence of the magnet bore. As such, the table is movable freely without causing any safety problems due to the drive motor.show the structural diagram of the cradle part of the MR system.  is a side view and  is a top view. The two cradles are connected and driven through a two racks-two gears structure. The gears structure includes a gear () coupled to the intermediate cradle. When the cradle supporting layer drives the intermediate cradle to move into the magnet bore, the gear () rotates clockwise. Because the belt pulley () and the gear () are coaxial, the belt pulley () also rotates clockwise. Further, because the belt pulley () and the belt pulley () are connected through a belt, the belt pulley () also rotates clockwise. Moreover, because the gear () and the belt pulley () are coaxial, the gear () thus rotates clockwise. The gear () drives the rack () on the upper cradle, to move the upper cradle into the magnet bore.Due to the two racks-two gears structure, the speed of the relative movement between the intermediate cradle and the upper cradle can be changed flexibly through adjusting the basic circle radius of gears () and () and the number of teeth of the pulleys () and (). For example, if the radius of the gears () and () are the same and the numbers of teeth of the pulleys () and () are the same, then the moving speed of the upper cradle relative to the intermediate cradle is the same as the moving speed of the intermediate cradle relative to the table. Or, if the number of teeth of pulley ()/the number of teeth of pulley () =n and the radius of gear ()/the radius of gear ()=1/n, the moving speed of the upper cradle relative to the intermediate cradle is the same as the moving speed of the intermediate cradle relative to the table base.,  and  show the working mechanism diagrams of the apparatus for driving and supporting the cradle.  shows an initial position in which the left side cradle is not positioned within the magnet bore and the cradle supporting layer () is positioned at an end of the magnet bore () opposing the cradle.  shows when the cradle is to be moved into the magnet bore. To move the cradle into the magnet bore, the motor () at the first side of the magnet bore drives the cradle supporting layer toward the cradle, and the cradle supporting layer couples to the intermediate cradle () using the hooks () and ().  shows when the cradle supporting layer has driven the intermediate cradle to move into the magnet bore, and the intermediate cradle drives the upper cradle () to extends into the magnet bore. As such, the rack and gear connection and the movement between the intermediate cradle and the upper cradle achieves a longer scanning range.The apparatus for driving and supporting cradle described herein can be applied to other imaging diagnostic apparatus in addition to a MR system, such as X-ray computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) and X-ray imaging system, etc.The above-described embodiments relate to an apparatus for driving and supporting cradle and a magnetic resonance system using the apparatus. More specifically, a double-cradle structure is used in the apparatus. Two cradles are coupled to each other and driven by a rack and gear structure. The apparatus further includes a cradle supporting part separate from a table, and a cradle supporting layer is coupled on the supporting bridge for supporting the protruding upper cradle. A drive motor is located at the side of the bridge and beyond the influence range of the magnet bore. A rear pedestal is omitted. The drive motor can drive the cradle supporting layer to move, and the cradle supporting layer can hook on to the intermediate cradle through a hook and drive the intermediate cradle to move. The intermediate cradle drives the upper cradle to reach into the inside of the magnet bore through its connection and driving with the upper cradle. A longer scanning range is realized by using a double-cradle structure and lowers requirement for room by removing the rear pedestal. The apparatus can ensure the free movement of the table and reduce the cradle sag during movement and ensure safety in emergencies.The above embodiments are only used for describing the present invention in an illustrative manner, but are not intended to limit the present invention. It shall be pointed out that those skilled in the art can make improvement, modification and variation to the present invention, but these improvements, modification and variation to the present invention without departing from the spirit of the present invention should be deemed to fall within the scope of protection of the present application."

                "This application claims benefit of and priority to Chinese Patent Application for Invention No. 201010216170.5, filed on 30 Jun. 2010, and Chinese Patent Application for Utility Model No. 201020250389.2, filed on 30 Jun. 2010, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.1) Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to an air mattress. More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved air mattress that is more comfortable and has a less weight.2) Description of Related ArtAir mattresses are used outdoors, at home, in the field of medical care, and so on, owing to their portability and easy storage. A conventional air mattress, as shown in , comprises a top sheet , a bottom sheet , annular connecting bands , and a side sheet . The top sheet , the bottom sheet , and the side sheet  are made of a flexible airtight material, for example, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and these sheets are welded together to form an inflatable compartment. The annular connecting band  is disposed within the inflatable compartment, with its top and bottom welded to the top sheet  and the bottom sheet  respectively. When the air mattress is inflated, the annular connecting bands  restrain the top and bottom sheets  and  to such an extent that the inflatable compartment looks and feels like a bed. As shown in , the annular connecting band  is formed by connecting a flat connecting band end to end to form a ring containing a hole in its center. Therefore, the resulting connecting band is named an annular connecting band. As shown in , the annular connecting band  is welded to the top and bottom sheets  and  to form a welded joint . The welded joint  may be circular, elliptic, oval, hexagonal, octagonal, and so on. Alternatively, the annular connecting band may be substituted by an I-shaped connecting band. As shown in , I-shaped connecting bands ′ are welded to the top and bottom sheets  and  to form linear welded joints ′.However, the known air mattress is made of three sheets of material, i.e. the top sheet, the bottom sheet, and the side sheet. Therefore, there are more welded joints between these three sheets, which requires more welding steps and takes more time. Further, when the inflated compartment is filled with air, under the action of the connecting bands, obvious projections and depressions are created on the surface of the air mattress, the depressions being positioned at the welded joints of the top sheet and the annular connecting bands, and the curved projections being positioned in the areas between the welded joints. As a result, the contact area between the surface of the air mattress and the human body is relatively small. With the I-shaped connecting bands, there also exist rectangular projections on the surface. This leads to poor flatness of the surface, and in use, the air mattress feels uncomfortable. In addition, if more connecting bands are provided, the surface will become more rigid and less flexible.Furthermore, 90 percent of the present commercially available air mattresses are made of pure PVC, flocked PVC, PVC laminated polyester or nylon fabric, and so on. These air mattresses are provided with annular connecting bands, I-shaped connecting bands, or slightly modified variations thereof. The air mattress made of PVC mainly has the following disadvantages: (1) the air mattress of this type is heavy and thus has poor portability; (2) PVC material is easy to be pierced and worn out; (3) PVC material is brittle at a low temperature and thus is not cold resistant; (3) the air mattress is not environmentally friendly; (5) the air mattress has a poor flatness; (6) the material must have a sufficient thickness since high frequency moulding is used in the manufacture process to perform a large-area welding operation; (7) since the air mattress is provided with narrow welding joints and has small areas for receiving pulling forces, the welding joints are often disengaged under the action of pulling forces, thereby leaking gas from the air mattress; and (8) the manufacture process is complex, resulting in high manufacturing cost.According to an embodiment of the invention, an air mattress may comprise: a top sheet and a bottom sheet, the top and bottom sheets being made of a flexible airtight material and being hermetically connected to form an airtight inflatable compartment; and at least one vertical connecting unit, being disposed within the compartment, wherein the at least one vertical connecting unit is attached to respective inner surfaces of the top and bottom sheets to form connecting areas.Each vertical connecting unit comprises: a top connecting member and a bottom connecting member, each of said top and bottom connecting members having a first portion which is attached to the corresponding inner surface and a second portion which is not attached to the inner surface; and an intermediate connecting member, which is connected to the second portions of the top and bottom connecting members.According to another embodiment of the invention, the air mattress may also comprise: a side sheet hermetically connected to the top and bottom sheets to form the compartment; and at least one horizontal connecting unit disposed within the compartment, said at least one horizontal connecting unit connected to opposite portions of the side sheet so as to restrain the side sheet in the length and width directions of the compartment, wherein each horizontal connecting unit comprises horizontal strips which are attached to the side sheet, and a flexible connecting member, the horizontal strips each having a third portion which is attached to the side sheet and a fourth portion which is not attached to the side sheet, the flexible connecting member connected to the opposite horizontal strips between the corresponding fourth portions thereof.It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only, and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.The air mattress of the present invention will be described below by way of example with reference to the drawings. However, it is to be understood that the following embodiments and drawings are illustrative, but not limiting to the scope of the invention. Further, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale for purpose of clarity.show an air mattress  of an exemplary embodiment according to the invention.  is a top view of the air mattress .  is a longitudinal sectional view of the air mattress of .  is a transverse sectional view of the air mattress of . As shown in , the air mattress  may include a top sheet  and a bottom sheet , which are circumferentially connected to form a connecting joint , thereby creating an airtight inflatable compartment . However, it should be noted that the disclosed air mattress may include a side sheet connected intermediate the top sheet and the bottom sheet. Within the inflatable compartment  there is provided a vertical connecting unit , which is connected to inner surfaces of the top and bottom sheets  and , so that connecting areas  are formed on outer surfaces of the air mattress, as shown clearly in . The air mattress  may also include means for feeding and discharging air (not shown). When the air mattress is being inflated, its vertical connecting unit  restricts the top and bottom sheets  and  in such a manner that the inflatable compartment  looks a bed that can support the load in an even manner when a user lies on the air mattress.The top and bottom sheets  and  may be made of flexible airtight material, such as PVC, which is used in the prior art. Preferably, the flexible airtight material may comprise TPU (Thermoplastic Urethane) laminated polyester, TPU laminated nylon, TPU laminated with other fabrics, or other macromolecular material laminated fabrics. A TPU film of TPU laminated fabrics may have a thickness of from 0.04 to 0.25 mm. Techniques for connecting the top and bottom sheets are not limited, provided that the inflated compartment is airtight. For example, a high frequency welding process or a thermal welding process may be used.In one embodiment, the vertical connecting unit  comprises several parts. For example, the vertical connecting unit  may include a top connecting member , a bottom connecting member  and an intermediate connecting member , as shown in . The top connecting member  may include at a first portion which is secured to an inner surface of the top sheet , and an adjacent second portion which is not secured to the inner surface of the top sheet . Similarly, the bottom connecting member  may include a first portion which is secured to an inner surface of the bottom sheet , and an adjacent second portion which is not secured to the inner surface of the bottom sheet . The intermediate connecting member  may be connected to the top and bottom connecting members at the corresponding second portions thereof.In an example shown in , the top connecting members  may comprise a top strip, and the bottom connecting member  may comprise a bottom strip. In this example, the top and bottom strips each comprise an elongated band. The air mattress  may include a plurality of the top and bottom strips disposed parallel to each other in the longitudinal directions of the air mattress, for example, 5 top strips and 5 bottom strips, as shown in . In other embodiments, each of the top and bottom members may comprise one or more identical or different strips (in terms of size and shape). The top and bottom strips may be made of flexible material which is used in the prior art. Preferably, the top and bottom strips may be made of TPU laminated nylon. The connecting area  formed by the first portion of the top strip and the top sheet is generally rectangular, as shown in . The connecting areas  may also be rhombic, elliptic, oval, hexagonal, octagonal, and so on. The second portion of the strip may be a narrowed portion of the strip, and extends between the adjacent first portions with a smooth transition. Techniques for connecting the top and bottom strips to the inner surfaces of the top and bottom sheets are not limited. For example, a high frequency welding process or a thermal welding process may be used. The arrangement of the strips is not limited to be in the longitudinal direction as shown, and may be in the traverse direction, in the diagonal direction, or in any other direction.The intermediate connecting member  is flexible, preferably a rope. As shown in , two corresponding second portions of the top and bottom connecting members may be connected to each other by a single rope. The rope is wound around the second portions to form a loop, and is knotted. Alternatively, the rope may be not wound to form a loop, but rather be knotted at the two ends thereof. Alternatively, a single rope may be used to connect all the section portions. In other embodiments, several ropes may be used to connect sets of the second portions, wherein the number of each group of the second portions may be the same or different. Preferably, a single rope may be used to connect two corresponding second portions. Such connecting process is simple and easy to be performed manually, and the distance between the top sheet and the bottom sheet may be controlled flexibly, so that the height of various portions of the air mattress can be changed. For example, a portion of the air mattress corresponding to the user's head can be raised to act as a pillow. In another embodiment, the upper half of the air mattress may be raised, so that the air mattress acts as a tilt bed.Now the first and second portions of the top and bottom connecting members  and  will be described in terms of relative positions thereof, with the air mattress in the substantially horizontal position. It should be noted that in this position, the second portions of the top and bottom connecting members  and  should not be construed as being offset from the corresponding first portions in the substantially horizontal direction. The second portions may be offset from the corresponding first portions in the vertical direction. For example, the strip may have a certain thickness, and include in the vertical direction the first portion secured to the inner surface and the second portion not secured to the inner surface formed, thereby allowing the connection of the intermediate connecting member  to the second portions. For example, the top and bottom members may be configured as a T-shaped structure, in which a horizontal part thereof comprises the first portion connected to the top and bottom sheets, and a vertical part thereof comprises the second portion.

                "This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/248,607 entitled “Pressure Dispersion Support System”, filed on Oct. 9, 2008, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.The present invention is in the filed of reflexive support systems, springs and spring systems, including support systems for humans such as seating and bedding.Different types of springs and spring systems are commonly used as the reflexive core of seating and support products such as chairs and mattresses. A common spring system which is used in mattresses and some upholstered furniture is the so-called “innerspring” which can be in one form a plurality of similarly or identically formed springs which are interconnected in an array or matrix. An innerspring provides a distributed generally homogeneous reflexive support system to give underlying support to an expanse such as the sleep surface of a mattress. The uniform spring rate across the expanse results from the common configuration of each of the interconnected springs. Attempts to alter the spring rate and feel of an entire innerspring or support area of an innerspring involve use of different types and amounts of materials such as foam, textiles and natural fibers as overlays on the innerspring. While the use of such materials does alter the feel and performance of the support system, it does not of course alter the spring rate of the underlying or internal innerspring.Innersprings which are made of formed steel wire and are manufactured by wire forming machinery which forms the individual springs or coils, and then connects them together by smaller lacing wires or other fasteners. Once the machines are set up to make a particular spring or coil design and interconnection, large runs are made and it is difficult to change the form of the springs and innerspring. Therefore, with current innerspring production technology, it is not practical to produce a single innerspring which has variable or non-homogenous spring rates and support characteristics in different areas of the innerspring.In one embodiment, a posture channel innerspring is described as an innerspring formed by a plurality of springs connected together in an array wherein the springs are arranged in rows and columns, each spring having a body with a first end and a second end, the body of each spring being generally cylindrical and having a longitudinal axis and an outer diameter, the springs being spaced apart in the rows and columns and connected together in a spaced apart arrangement with each spring being spaced from each adjacent spring in the array. At least one posture channel insert is located in the innerspring in spaces between springs of the innerspring, the posture channel having an upper lateral member, a lower lateral member parallel and spaced apart from the upper lateral member and a transverse member which extends between and bisects the upper and lower lateral members, wherein the upper lateral member contains an arched upper surface and the lower lateral member contains an arched lower surface and wherein the upper and lower lateral members extend between and into the coils of two adjacent springs of the innerspring.A second embodiment of the posture channel innerspring is described having a plurality of helical form coils interconnected in an array in which the coils are generally aligned in rows and columns, each of the coils having a generally cylindrical coil body formed by helical turns of wire with openings between each of the helical turns of wire, and first and second ends to the coil body also formed by the wire, each of the coil bodies being spaced apart in the array. At least one posture channel insert is located between and engaged with two or more of the coils of the innerspring, the at least one posture channel insert having a lower lateral member, a vertical member which is perpendicular to and bisects the lower lateral member and a lateral extension which extends outward from one side of the vertical member. The lower lateral member extends between and into the body of two adjacent coils of the innerspring, the lateral extension extends into the body of one of the two adjacent coils and the vertical member is in contact with the two adjacent coils.As shown in the drawings, an innerspring generally referenced at , has a plurality of springs or coils (herein referred to alternatively as “coils” or “springs”), although the disclosure and invention is not limited to any one particular type or form of spring or coil or other reflexive device. The coils are arranged in an array, such as an orthogonal array of columns and rows and interconnected by lacing wires which in one form are helical wires which are laced about turns of adjacent coils and typically run transverse across a width of the innerspring, but which can be run in other directions. The lacing wires can be located at either or both ends of the coils. Coil ends are formed at opposite axial ends of the coil body and aligned in the opposing (upper and lower) planes of the innerspring as described. The coil ends are aligned in planes which define support surfaces of the innerspring. In many innersprings of this type, there is open space between the adjacent coil bodies, necessary to allow flexure, compression and deflection of the coils and relative movement without inter-coil contact.In a first embodiment of the present invention, the coils of the mattress innerspring shown are rotated coil head coils (herein after referred to as “RCH coils”) , which have a generally cylindrical body  formed by a plurality of helical turns, as shown in . The coil ends ,  each have an offset and the opposing coil ends are inverted relative to each other so that they terminate on the same side of the coil body . The rotated coil head prevents the coil from leaning in a lateral direction when a downwardly directed load is applied to the innerspring. The generally cylindrical coil body  has a longitudinal axis which runs the length of the coil at the radial center of each of the helical turns of the coil . The coil body  is contiguous with the first coil end, generally indicated at  and a second coil end, generally indicated at . The designations “first coil end” and “second coil end’ are for identification and reference only and do not otherwise define the locations or orientations of the coil ends. Accordingly, either the first coil end  or the second coil end  may alternatively be referred to herein as “coil end”. Either of the coil ends ,  may serve as the support end of the coil  in an innerspring in a one or two-sided mattress. Each of the coil ends ,  lie generally in respective planes generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the coil body . The coil ends ,  are identical in form and have a larger diameter than the coil body . The coil ends ,  are each formed in an open end offset configuration comprised of three offset portions and an open end. The overall shape of the coil ends ,  is rectangular. Offset portions  and  have generally straight segments which are roughly parallel to each other. The third offset portion  extends between ends of the first  and second  offset portions and has a stepped segment of multiple contiguous segments -. Coil ends which have one or more linear segments, such as in coil ends  and , are advantageous for allowing the coils to be more closely spaced in an innerspring array than coils with circular ends, and by providing a linear path for lacing wires that run between coils. The coils are positioned such that the offset portions of the adjacent coils in a row overlap. The overlapped offset pairs are then secured together by spirally rotating a first set of helical coil springs across the rows so as to interlace the overlapped offset portions. Since the coils are generally helical in form, the turns of each coil are laterally aligned and together form a wave-form or serpentine spaces or openings between each coil and between the rows and columns of coils in the innerspring. The spaces or openings  extend into the respective coil bodies. For example, as shown in , the openings have different zones or areas or regions indicated at , , , , and (also referred to herein as “opening regions” or “spaces”) defined by the helical turns of the opposing coils. The opening regions -extend into the respective coil bodies. The number of openings will vary according to the number of helical turns of the coil body.An H-shaped posture channel  is used in combination with an RCH coil innerspring as described above and as shown in . The posture channel  contains upper  and lower  parallel lateral members and a transverse member  that extends between and bisects the upper  and lower  lateral members. The upper and lower parallel lateral members ,  each include two segments , , , which fit between the coils of an innerspring, in the gaps or openings  formed between spaced apart coils. The posture channels  are configured to fit within at least two or more openings  in order to engage with and maintain alignment with the coils. Each posture channel  contains two upper segments , which extend from the lateral member  in opposing first and second directions and two lower segments , which extend from the lateral member  in opposing first and second directions. Each posture channel  has a unique slanted or angled configuration that enables the lateral segments to extend into and fit securely within the opening region between two adjacent coils or rows of adjacent coils without the use of an attachment mechanism. In a preferred embodiment, each of the transverse parallel members is approximately between 90.5 and 94.2 mm wide. The transverse member  that extends between and bisects the two transverse parallel members ,  is approximately between 15.5 and 18.5 mm wide. The height of the entire pasture channel  is approximately between 57 and 60 mm.One representative cross-sectional form of an H-shaped posture channel insert  of the disclosure is shown in . Here, the posture channel insert is positioned within the space between adjacent coils in a lengthwise direction. Section of the posture channel support fits within opening of a first coil while section is positioned within opening of a second coil. Also, section is located within opening of the first coil while section is located within opening of the second coil. Another example of a cross-sectional form of the H-shaped posture channel insert  is shown in . In this example, the posture channel insert is positioned within the space between adjacent coils in a widthwise direction. Section of the posture channel insert is positioned within opening of a first coil and section is positioned within opening of a second coil. Section is positioned within opening lie of the first coil and section is positioned within opening of the second coil.As shown in , different lengths of posture support channels  are arranged in a generally U-shaped configuration proximate to the right and left side edges and the bottom edge of the innerspring. This arrangement provides increased stability in the border region of the mattress. Two H-shaped posture channel supports are positioned in a longitudinal direction parallel to one another, with one H-shaped posture channel positioned in a transverse direction extending between and perpendicular to the two longitudinally placed posture channels. Each section of piece of the posture channels can be closely abutted with an intersection section or piece, or a space left therebetween. The number, size and location of the posture channel inserts can also create or define zones or regions of the innerspring which have different support characteristics from other zones or regions. These can accordingly be placed or designed for particular mattress application, such as creating increased support and/or pressure-reducing areas or zones in cooperation with overlying layers of material such as foam padding layers, woven and non-woven material layers and upholstery including padded upholstery. The length of the posture channels used for the edge supporting U-shaped configuration shown in  is dependent upon the size of the mattress. The approximate length of each posture channel is shown in the following table with respect to the various standard mattress sizes:In a second embodiment of the present invention, the coils of the mattress innerspring shown in , are two-tiered RCH coils . The only difference between the RCH coil  as described above, and the two-tiered RCH coil  is that the two-tiered coil is asymmetrical about both a horizontal and vertical plane. The term asymmetric, as used herein, refers to the configuration of the coil on one side of a reference plane, such as a vertical reference plane passing through a vertical axis A of the coil body , or a horizontal reference plane passing perpendicularly through the axis A is different on one side of the plane than on the other. The coils  have a generally helical form coil body  which extends between a base or bottom end  and a top or support end . The base  and top  of the coil may also be referred to as the terminal convolutions. The portion of the coil body  on the side of the reference plane HP proximate to the top or support end is also referred to as the upper region of the coil body. The portion of the coil body  on the side of the reference plane HP proximate to the base or bottom end is also referred to as the lower region. As is known in the art, the primary factors which determine the spring rate and resultant feel of a spring are wire gauge, the size (diameter) and the pitch (or pitch angle) of the helical turns of the coil. In generally, the more turns to the coil the lower the spring rate, with a resultant softer feel and support. Larger diameter turns in a coil also contribute to a lower spring rate and consequent softer feel. The greater or steeper the pitch, the stiffer the spring is, due to increased vertical orientation of the wire. As can be seen in , the pitch angle between the turns or convolutions in the lower region of the coil is much smaller than the pitch angle between the turns or convolutions in the upper region of the coil, providing a relatively stiff lower region. The pitch gradually increases toward the top of the coil, which lessens the spring rate toward and upper region of the coil body, treating a softer feel or support to the spring, at least upon initial compression. The diameter of each of the turns is identical except for the second turn from the base of the coil, which happens to have the largest diameter of the coil body. An increasing diameter generally increases the spring rate to a stiffer feel, which again, combined with the lower pitch angles, give the lower region of the coil body a stiffer, more supportive feel than the upper region of the coil.A generally T-shaped posture channel , shown in  is used in combination with a two-tiered RCH coil innerspring, as described above. The generally T-shaped posture channel  contains a lower lateral member  and a vertical member  which is perpendicular to and bisects the lower lateral member . The vertical member  additionally contains a lateral extension  which extends outward from one side of the vertical member . The lower lateral member  contains a right portion and a left portion . These posture channels  are uniquely designed to fit between the spaces or openings between two two-tired RCH coils  located in adjacent rows of the innerspring. A first portion of the lower lateral member and the lateral extension  of the vertical member  fit between two adjacent coils of the same spring. A second portion of the lower lateral member extends into the turns of a coil located in an adjacent row of the innerspring. In a preferred embodiment, the generally T-shaped posture channel  is between approximately 72.5 and 77.5 mm wide and approximately between 44.5 and 49.5 mm high. The width of the vertical member, at its largest point, is approximately between 18.5 and 21.5 mm and the height from the lower lateral member to the top of the lateral extension is approximately between 26.5 and 29.5 mm.A representative cress-sectional form of the T-shaped posture channel insert  of the disclosure is shown in . The spaces or openings between two adjacent two-tier RCH coils, referred to as openings -, accommodate the various sections of the T-shaped posture channels. For example, the right portion of the lower lateral member  is positioned within opening of a first coil and the left portion ) is positioned within opening of a second coil. The lateral extension  is positioned within opening of the first coil. Vertical member  is in contact with both the first and second coils.As shown in , a plurality of generally T-Shaped posture channels  are positioned along two rows proximate to and running along the length of the right side of the innerspring, along two rows proximate to and running along the length of the left side of the innerspring, and along one horizontal row proximate to the foot of a mattress and extending substantially between the two right side and two left side rows of posture channels. The following chart shows the various sized T-shaped channels used for different mattress sizes:In a preferred embodiment, both the H-shaped and T-shaped posture channels described above are made of 100% low density polyethylene with a density of approximately 1.25 lb/ft, although other materials and densities are considered to be within the scope of the invention.It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive. Other features and aspects of this invention will be appreciated by those skilled in the art upon reading and comprehending this disclosure. Such features, aspects, and expected variations and modifications of the reported results and examples are clearly within the scope of the invention where the invention is limited solely by the scope of the following claims."

Therefore, the jaws can be used to grip a fastener, wire, or any suitable material, and the pliers is rotated via the handle to rotate the fastener, wire, or material.Traditionally, pliers have had their handles dipped in a bath of rubber. With this traditional process, the rubber can easily rip, tear, crack or slide off of the frame. In other traditional processes, the grips are premolded separate from the tool and then glued and pressed onto the frame. With this traditional process, the glue can breakdown, especially if the tool becomes hot, and the grips pull off of the tool.In one embodiment, the invention provides a pliers including a first member having a head portion and a handle portion and a second member pivotally coupled to the first member. The second member includes a head portion and a handle portion, and the head portions of the first and the second members define a head of the pliers and the handle portions of the first and the second members define a handle of the pliers. The pliers further includes a first end that defines a nose of the head portion, a second end, opposite the first end, defined by the handle of the pliers, and a first plurality of ridges disposed on the first member adjacent the nose. A second plurality of ridges is disposed on the second member adjacent the nose, and the first and the second plurality of ridges together define a grip of the pliers. A first sharp edge is disposed on the first member adjacent the first plurality of ridges and between the first plurality of ridges and the second end of the pliers. A second sharp edge is disposed on the second member adjacent the second plurality of ridges and between the second plurality of ridges and the second end of the pliers. Together the first and second sharp edges define a cutter of the pliers. A pivot pivotally couples the first member and the second member adjacent the cutter and between the cutter and the second end of the pliers, and an aperture extends through the first member adjacent the pivot and between the pivot and the second end of the pliers. The aperture and the second member define a fastener cutter of the pliers.In another embodiment, the invention provides a pliers including a first member having a head portion and a handle portion and a second member pivotally coupled to the first member. The second member includes a head portion and a handle portion, and the head portions of the first and the second members define a head of the pliers and the handle portions of the first and the second members define a handle of the pliers. A first resilient grip member is located on the handle portion of the first member, and the first resilient grip member abuts the head portion of the first member such that an outer surface of the first resilient grip member is flush with the head portion of the first member to define a smooth transition between the first resilient grip member and the head portion of the first member. A second resilient grip member is located on the handle portion of the second member, the second resilient grip member abuts the head portion of the second member such that an outer surface of the second resilient grip member is flush with the head portion of the second member to define a smooth transition between the first resilient grip member and the head portion of the second member.In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of manufacturing a pliers including providing a frame that defines a head and a handle of the pliers, molding a resilient grip member directly onto the handle of the pliers, and where molding the resilient grip member onto the handle includes extending a portion of the resilient grip member into a recess of the handle to fixably couple the resilient grip member to the handle.Other aspects of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the detailed description and accompanying drawings.Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways.illustrates a pliers , which in the illustrated embodiment is referred to as a lineman's pliers. The pliers  includes a first member  and a second member  that is pivotally connected to the first member  such that the members ,  pivot with respect to each other about a pivot point . A pin  is used to pivotally couple the members ,  and defines the pivot point . The members ,  both include a head portion  and a handle portion . Together the head portions  define a head  of the pliers  and together the handle portions  define a handle  of the pliers . In one embodiment, the members ,  are formed from corrosion resistant metal and the head portions  are cryogenically treated to increase the gripping life of the pliers . A chemically bonded coating may be placed over all of the cast and machined surfaces to increase the corrosion resistance of the tool and to provide an attractive gray or black finish to the tool. Hand tools are often exposed to wet environments and experience corrosion and the chemically bonded coating increases the resistance to such corrosion.The handle portions  are both covered with a rubber (or other suitable grip material) over mold  to form a resilient grip member of the handle portions  while the metal of the head portions  remains exposed. The rubber over molds  provide extra durability, increase user comfort, and reduce slippage of the user's hand on the pliers . The over molds  both abut the adjacent head portion  at a transition area . The rubber over molds , head portions , and handle portions  are formed such that there is a smooth transition between the over mold  and the adjacent head portion  at the transition area . Alternatively stated, an outer surface  of the over mold  is flush with the adjacent head portion . This smooth transition between the exposed metal of the head portion  and the rubber over mold  helps to reduce the likelihood of the over molds  getting caught on a tool pouch, tool bucket, etc. and ripping the over molds  or grip of the pliers . The method of over molding the pliers  will be discussed in more detail below with respect to .Referring to , each of the head portions  includes ribs or ridges  that create a first grip  at a nose  of the pliers . The nose  defines a first end  of the pliers  whereas the handle portions  define a second end  of the pliers  opposite the first end . The nose  generally tapers toward the first end  from the second end . Behind the grip  (between the grip  and the pivot point ) the members ,  both include a sharp edge  (). Together the sharp edges  define a cutter  of the pliers . The pliers  is opened and closed by pivoting the members ,  about pivot point  and the cutter  can be used to cut wire, wire insulation (i.e., a wire stripper), or other suitable material.With continued reference to , the pliers  further includes a plurality of ridges  that extend parallel to each other along the head portion  of the first member  and generally face a first direction. Ridges  also extend parallel to each other along the head portion  of the second member  and generally face a second direction that is directly opposed to the first direction. The ridges  and edge allow the user to use the pliers  to ream a pipe to remove burrs or otherwise smooth the inside of a pipe wall along a cut of the pipe. To use the pliers  as a reamer, the user inserts the nose  of the pliers  into a pipe or the like, until the pipe wall contacts the ridges  and the user rotates the pipe or pliers  so that the ridges  remove burrs and smooth the pipe wall along the cut.Referring to , the pliers  further includes a first threaded aperture  and a second threaded aperture  that are used as a threaded fastener cutter. The apertures ,  extend through the head portion  of the first member  between the pivot  and the second end  of the pliers . In the illustrated embodiment, the first aperture  has a first diameter and is sized to receive a #6 Unified National size bolt and the second aperture  has a second diameter, larger than the first diameter, and sized to receive a #8 Unified National size bolt. In other embodiments, the apertures ,  can have any suitable size. In operation, the user opens the handle  and the head  and then threads a fastener into one of the apertures  or  and then closes the handle  to close the head , which cuts the fastener. In an alternative operation, the second member  includes a first unthreaded aperture  and a second unthreaded aperture . The first unthreaded aperture  is aligned with the first threaded aperture  to receive the threaded fastener when the handle  is closed (position illustrated in ) and the second unthreaded aperture  is aligned with the second threaded aperture  to receive the threaded fastener when the handle  is closed. Therefore, the user can insert the threaded fastener into one of the threaded apertures  or  until the fastener enters the corresponding aperture  or . Then, the user can open the handle  or separate handle portions  about the pivot  to shear and cut the fastener. The threads of apertures ,  protect the threads of the fastener from damage during cutting.Referring to , the pliers  further includes a second grip  located behind the threaded apertures  and  and between the aperture  and  and the second end  of the pliers . Ridges  are formed on the head portions  of both of the members ,  to form the second grip . The second grip  provides the user with an additional area to grip material, crimp wire, and the like.Accordingly, the pliers  includes several accessory features, such as a wire strippers, a wire cutter, a pipe reamer, a threaded fastener cutter, and a first grip and a second grip. This particular arrangement of accessory features on the pliers  has been found particularly convenient and advantageous for use as a lineman's pliers.Referring to , the pliers  is formed from a frame  and the handle over molds  () are molded directly onto the frame . As discussed above, the illustrated frame  is formed from metal by casting, and/or forging machining and a coating may be chemically bonded to the finished surfaces. The chemically bonded coating provides an attractive gray or black finish to the pliers  and protects the pliers  from corrosion. As illustrated in , the frame  is formed with apertures  that extend laterally through the handle portions  of the members , . Also, the frame  is formed with a recess  that extends circumferentially around both the handle portions  adjacent the second end  of the pliers . Although the illustrated embodiment includes both the apertures  and the recesses , in other embodiments, the frame  may include only either the apertures  or the recesses  or some combination thereof.The over molds  include a first over mold  and a second over mold  (). The first and the second over molds  and  are molded directly onto the handles  by placing the frame  into a mold used to form the over molds , . Alternatively stated, the over molds ,  are not formed separate or unattached from the frame  and then later slid onto or attached to the frame by using an adhesive or friction fit. During the molding process, the over molds ,  extend through the apertures  and into the recesses  to fixably attached the over molds ,  to the frame . The over molds ,  are fixably attached such that the over molds ,  generally cannot be removed without permanently damaging the over molds ,  (e.g., cutting the over molds , ). While the illustrated frame  includes the apertures  and recesses , in other embodiments, other features, such as a deep groove, ribs or other non-smooth features, could be used to interlock the over molds ,  to the frame .As discussed above, traditionally, pliers have had their handles dipped in a bath of rubber and not directly molded to the frame as previously discussed. With this traditional dipping process, the rubber can easily rip, tear, crack or slide off of the frame. In other traditional processes, the grips are premolded separate from the tool and then glued and pressed onto the frame using an adhesive. With this traditional process, the glue can breakdown, especially if the tool becomes hot, and the grips pull off of the tool.Accordingly, the present invention provides a pliers that includes an improved handle structure that is especially resistant to damage and an arrangement of features that has been found to be particularly useful in a lineman's pliers. Various features are set forth in the following claims."

                "This application claims the benefits under 35 U.S.C. §119(a)-(d) of Great Britain Application No. 1011275.3, filed on Jul. 5, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.This invention relates to support platforms, particularly but not exclusively to bridges and methods of construction thereof.Bridges for roads and walkways have traditionally been constructed from heavy materials such as stone, steel or reinforced concrete. Conventional bridges comprise a contact surface over which a load, for example road vehicles, may pass. The contact surface must meet design criteria including wear performance, longevity, slip resistance and the ability to drain water from the contact surface. The contact surface of a bridge is not usually capable of carrying its own weight and requires to be supported by a decking. The decking provides structural support to the contact surface and transfers the load to the main bridge structure. Secondary features such as footpaths, barriers or railings can be considered as part of the decking. The main bridge structure or superstructure carries all of the elements of a bridge across the distance that the bridge must span. The design of the superstructure is complex and must take account of criteria such as seismic design, expansion considerations, substructure design and wind loadings.The transient load of the majority of modern bridge designs will typically be in the form of vehicular traffic and the details are specified in recognised standards. An example is; AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, Customary U.S. Units, 4Edition with 2008 and 2009 U.S. Edition Interims. Standard-Item Code: 15-LRFDUS-4-M. Applying these standards to bridge design allows one to determine the transient loads that must be applied to a bridge design. The transient load offers no opportunity for weight reduction as it is fixed by national and international standards and the bridge must be designed to carry the required loadings.It is an object of the present invention to provide a decking and contact surface system for construction of bridges or other support platforms, for example for railway passenger platforms. The support platforms in accordance with this invention are referred to in this specification for simplicity as “bridges”.It is a further object to provide a deck system for road bridges. It is another object to provide a decking and contact surface for a bridge. It is a further object to provide a method of construction of a bridge, especially a road bridge.According to a first aspect of the present invention, a bridge structure includes a contact surface supported by a decking mounted on a superstructure. The superstructure includes a mounting for the decking. The decking includes a panel composed of a fibre reinforced polymer composite. The panel includes a plate having an upperside and an underside and a plurality of first and second beams. Each beam includes an upper face and a base face and side faces. The upper face of each beam is integral with the underside of the plate. A first beam includes an aperture extending between the side faces. A second beam extends through the aperture. The panel further includes means for attachment to the superstructure. A layer of wear-resistant material is provided on the upper side of the plate.According to a second aspect of the present invention, a method of construction of a bridge structure includes the steps of assembling a superstructure having a mounting. A panel composed of a fibre reinforced polymer composite is provided. The panel includes a plate having an upperside and an underside and a plurality of first and second beams. Each beam includes an upper face and a base face and side faces. The upper face of each beam is integral with the underside of the plate. A first beam includes an aperture extending between the side faces. A second beam extends through the aperture. The mounting is dimensioned to receive the panel. The panel is attached to the superstructure. A layer of wear-resistant material is provided on the upper side of the plate.The bridge of the present invention may comprise a road bridge, railway bridge, footbridge or other support platform, for example a railway platform. The bridge or platform may be a permanent structure. Alternatively, a temporary or emergency bridge or platform may be provided.The bridge structure and method of construction confer considerable advantages. The panels may be made in a factory for assembly on site, reducing the difficulty in working in adverse weather conditions. The speed of assembly is much greater than for conventional bridge constructions, resulting in particular applications in emergency or military situations or where disruption to traffic is undesirable.Bridge structures in accordance with this invention preferably are capable of supporting the high loadings generated by high volume vehicular traffic for 25 years. The structures may have a high wear resistant surface which may maintain a minimum wet coefficient of friction value of 0.5.The surface preferably includes a configuration adapted to facilitate removal of water. The layer of wear resistant material may include a tread pattern arranged to provide a drainage channel on the upper side of the plate. Preferably a network of drainage channels for example a groove pattern is provided to facilitate drainage of rainwater from the bridge surface.Attachment of the panels described to the bridge superstructure requires an attachment system that can withstand the high number of loadings the panel is expected to encounter in use. The system is preferably capable of being deployed rapidly at the time of initial assembly and also if a panel needs to be replaced. The kinematics of the design should ensure movements due to temperature changes are accommodated and that vibration from constant traffic has no detrimental effect on the attachment system.A fully constrained attachment system is preferred. Suitable attachment systems are adapted to accommodate minor movements in the superstructure, for example caused by thermal expansion, load variations, wind forces and variations in traffic densities.In preferred embodiments, the superstructure includes a mounting dimensioned to receive a panel, the attachment means comprising a projection extending upwardly from the mounting, and a socket in the panel adapted to receive and engage the projection to secure the panel to the mounting.Each panel may include two or more sockets. One socket and projection may be configured to form a secure engagement to prevent movement of the panel, a second socket and projection being configured to engage the panel to the mounting but permitting relative movement to accommodate thermal expansion.The socket and projection may form a friction engagement to locate the panel in the desired location; both or other fasteners may not be required, particularly for temporary bridges for example for military use. Quick release fasteners may be employed, for example the type produced by Dzus.In a particularly preferred embodiment, the socket is located between adjacent first and second beams of the panel. In this embodiment the configuration of intersecting beams provides an economical and efficient means of robustly locating the means of attachment within the decking. Preferably the first and second beams are arranged in parallel, for example rectangular, arrays wherein a pair of first beams and a pair of second beams are configured to form a four sided cavity to accommodate the socket.The panel may advantageously have closed edges. The upper and base portions and sides may form an integral solid flange extending peripherally of the panel. This arrangement allows the load to be transmitted in use through the peripheral flanges so that the attachments are not load supporting.The panels may be manufactured according to the process disclosed in EP 3655579, the disclosure of which is incorporated into this specification by reference for all purposes.Preferred materials comprise a composite of glass fibre for example E-glass fibres. The glass fibres may be in the form of woven or stitch bonded fabrics. Polyester, epoxy or polyurethane resins may be used. The preferred resin is a urethane-acrylate resin, for example a methacrylate resin. The composite may be manufactured in accordance with the disclosure of EP 6766094, the disclosure of which is incorporated into this specification by reference for all purposes.A typical glass fibre composite panel produced as detailed above may measure 1374 mm×600 mm and may weigh 50 kg. The panel may span 1274 mm and when loaded centrally via a plate 230 mm×230 mm provide a failure load of 400 kN.The contact surface may comprise a layer of aggregate particles embedded in the surface of the glass fibre composite.Suitable aggregates include silicon carbide, silica, sand or crushed granite.A preferred aggregate is calcined bauxite. A particularly preferred material has a particle size of 14/30 mesh. Use of calcined bauxite is preferred because it has a hardness value of 9 on the Mohr scale and does not polish because the particles retain their sharp edges in use.When incorporated into a tread pattern the aggregate preferably increases the coefficient of friction of the tread to a value greater than 0.5. This provides excellent grip properties. These properties are preferably retained throughout the life of the tread. Wear tests have shown that the treads in accordance with this invention can have a life of 100,000,000 foot placement events when leather soled shoes are used by a pedestrian. Rolling contact of rubber tyres is less aggressive and the life is therefore greater.Attachment of the panels described to the bridge superstructure requires an attachment system that can withstand the high number of loadings the panel is expected to encounter in use. The system is preferably capable of being deployed rapidly at the time of initial assembly and also if a panel needs to be replaced. The kinematics of the design should ensure movements due to temperature changes are accommodated and that vibration from constant traffic has no detrimental effect on the attachment system.The composite panel, for example a square or rectangular panel, may be provided with a cavity at two locations of the lower face. The locations are preferably disposed in spaced locations on the lower face, for example on opposite sides thereof. The cavity accommodates an attachment means that is adapted to be attached to the bridge superstructure. Preferably, the attachment means includes a shock absorber arrangement and includes means to permit a panel to be attached to the mounting. The panel at each of the two cavities may have moulded within the composite structure means for securing the panel to the mounting, for example a member having a threaded bore for receiving and locking in place a retaining bolt.In one embodiment, the two cavities in the panel have the same dimensions and two different sizes of projection. The first size matches the dimensions of the cavity and when the panel is placed onto the mounting the panel it is fully constrained in the X and Y axes and also preventing rotation in the Z direction. The second size of mounting may have the same dimensions as the first mounting in the Y axis and is smaller in the X axis. The second mounting serves to restrain the panel in the Y axis but permits limited movement in the X axis. With this arrangement the panel is fully constrained in both the X and Y axes and also preventing Z rotation whilst allowing for small expansion movements between panel and superstructure due to temperature changes or other effects.The panel may be secured in the Z axis by placing a retaining bolt or other fixture through the attachment means in the panel and screwing it into the mounting. A bolt head locking spring may be fitted to the attachment means to prevent movement of the bolt. The attachment means may be sealed using a sealant composition or an elastomeric plug.The mountings may be attached to the main body of the superstructure by four bolts. The method of securing these bolts may depend on the material used for the structural element of the superstructure. For example if steel is used then it may be drilled and tapped to provide threaded holes or it may be drilled and locking washers and locking nuts could be used. The objective is to provide the optimum system for the material being used and ensure a secure system is deployed that will not corrode.In situ the panels may be sealed by the inclusion of a sealing member or application of appropriate mastic. The edges of the panels may include a ledge arrangement to support a sealing member.Panels in accordance with this invention may incorporate sensors to generate signals indicative of movement of the panel, deformation of the panel or to allow identification of each panel for maintenance purposes. The sensor may be embedded within the composition during moulding. This way the sensor may be protected from corrosion or tampering by the surrounding composite.The superstructure may comprise any conventional bridge or platform structure to include steel, aluminium, reinforced composite, reinforced concrete, stone or wooden superstructures mounted on appropriate foundations.This invention provides the following advantages when compared to conventional bridge construction systems: (1) a significant reduction in the weight of the three main elements of a bridge, the wear surface, decking and superstructure; (2) all components can be manufactured in a factory environment; (3) on site work consists only of assembly; (4) on site assembly of panels that create the decking and wear surface can be performed rapidly without heavy lifting equipment; and (5) long life components that can be replaced within a very short time period. Panels that provide the decking and wear surface when attached to the bridge superstructure can immediately accept transient loads such as vehicular traffic.The function of a bridge is to carry a transient load () from one location to a second location. In  the transient load () travels on a wear surface () which can be replaced when worn out and provides selected properties such as a high coefficient of friction to provide good grip, drainage properties to assist dispersal of water and good wear resistance. The wear surface is structurally supported by a decking (). The decking () is designed to carry the weight of the transient load (), the weight of the wear surface () and the weight of the decking () and to transfer these loads to the superstructure ().The superstructure () can be made from engineering materials such as steel, aluminium, reinforced concrete or glass reinforced composite. The superstructure () is often made from wide-flange beams or I-beams that are designed to support the transient load (), which may have very high dynamic and static loading conditions associated with vehicles travelling over or stopped on the superstructure (). Bridge superstructures can be designed in a number of configurations and these are to a certain extent dictated by the span of the bridge and weight to be carried over the span. A principal object of this invention is to reduce the weight of the total structure in order to offer a designer a greater selection of materials and structural configurations.Referring to , the wear surface () and the decking () are combined into a panel () which may be made from an advanced composite material preferably composed of glass fibre reinforcing fibres and a urethane-acrylate matrix resin. The top surface () which is in contact in use with transient load () provides the same function as a conventional wear surface (). In order to create a wear surface () the top surface () is provided with a tread pattern (). The tread pattern () functions to disperse surface water and provide grip. The tread pattern () on the top surface () may have a variety of different designs and constructions that increase the frictional resistance between the transient load (), which could be foot traffic or vehicles, and the top surface ().Referring to , each of the tread elements () contains grains of aggregate preferably 14/30 mesh calcined bauxite () which are packed at maximum packing density throughout the entire depth of the each tread element (). During manufacture of the panel () the urethane-acrylate matrix resin is infused through the calcined bauxite () bonding the calcined bauxite () together and to the composite laminate (). A preferred tread pattern () provides a wear surface with a coefficient of friction better than 0.5 and exceptional wear properties. The tread depth may be typically 6 mm (¼″) and may have a lower specific gravity than a typical wear surface (). A conventional wear surface () would be typically 50 mm (2″) thick and if there was no difference in specific gravity, the tread pattern () would only represent 12.5% of the weight of a conventional wear surface (). This provides a saving in weight of 87.5%.The composite panel () is preferably made using the composite structure described in WO 2007/020618. This can provide the structural strength of a bridge decking whilst offering a significant weight saving in the region of 80% when compared to typical reinforced concrete decking.The manufacturing process involves building a preform of glass fibre laminates which take the same form as the finished product. The preform together with embedded components such as metal items and the wear surface aggregate, preferably calcined bauxite are loaded into a mould. The mould is closed and sealed. Low level vacuum is applied to the mould and then catalysed urethane-acrylate resin is injected into the mould and infused through the fibre structure and calcined bauxite. Once the mould is filled it is sealed and the resin given time to cure.The mould is then opened and the completed component removed. Flash is removed and the product is then complete. The process of moulding may take about 20 minutes.The process of injection is carried using a commercially available machine. A typical example is the injection machine supplied by Autisan International of Sarasota, USA.Building of the preforms can involve a number of techniques and depends on the shape and complexity of the product. Typically different fabrics of glass fibre are cut to precise shapes and assembled into the preform. Polyurethane cores can be used to attach the laminates. The laminates can be thermally heat bonded or stitch bonded. A combination of methods may be used.In  the lower face of panel () is shown. The beam structure () that provides the structural strength is illustrated and at both ends of panel () a socket () is provided that is formed within the beam structure (). The function of the sockets is to provide part of an attachment system () to connect panel () to the bridge superstructure (). Locating the sockets () within the beam structure () places them structurally within a very strong part of the panel ensuring that panel () and superstructure () will be capable of withstanding the loads imposed by vehicle traffic.In  two ‘I’ beams () of a bridge superstructure () are shown. Attached to the ‘I’ beams are mounting units () and (). During assembly the panel () is lowered onto the ‘I’ beams () so that the mounting units () and () locate in the sockets () provided in the lower face of the panel (). The result is that the panel () is fully constrained in axis X and Y and Z rotation. Fitting the two retaining bolts () constrains the panel () in the X, Y and Z axes. Panel () is fully constrained by this attachment system (). Mounting unit  includes a substantially circular receiving aperture while mounting unit  includes an elongate receiving aperture that provides increased tolerance to the attachment system (), thereby ensuring connectability of the panel () to the ‘I’ beams ().In  the mounting unit () of attachment system () is shown. Mounting unit () has a housing () typically made as a die casting from high grade aluminium such as LM 25-TF (BS 1490). A central hole () in the top face of the housing () is provided to receive a retaining bolt (). Each corner of housing () is provided with a hole () and recess () to receive a socket head cap screw () whose function is to clamp the housing () to the superstructure (). On each of the four side faces of housing () is a shock absorber (), for example made of a nitrile rubber. When panel () is assembled the four faces of cavity () each contact a corresponding shock absorber (). Tightening the retaining bolt () causes the shock absorbers () to be compressed to a predetermined amount.Referring to  it can be seen that retaining lip () locates and retains the shock absorber () within housing (). Voids () and () are provided for shock absorber () to be compressed into when panel () is positioned onto attachment system () and retaining bolt () fitted and fully tightened. In the centre of the lower surface of housing () a nut () is located and retained by walls (). When panel () is assembled on to attachment system () retaining bolt () can be screwed into nut ().Mounting unit () constrains panel () in the X and Y axes and prevents Z rotation. Restraining bolt () constrains the panel () in the vertical Z axis. Shock absorbers () restrict minor movement, such as vibratory movement, of panel (), resulting from dynamic loading conditions, which could lead to wear occurring between panel () and the superstructure (). This restriction also helps to damp noise.In  the mounting unit () of attachment system () are described in detail. Mounting unit () has a housing () typically made as a die casting from a high grade aluminium such as LM 25-TF. A centrally positioned slot () is provided to receive a retaining bolt (). Each of the four corners of housing () are provided with a hole () and recess () to receive a socket head cap screw () whose function is to clamp housing () to the superstructure (). On two sides of housing () a shock absorber (), typically made of nitrile rubber, is provided. When panel () is assembled on attachment system () the shock absorbers () contact the two faces of cavity () which are parallel with the long side of panel (). Tightening retaining bolt () causes the shock absorbers to be compressed a predetermined amount.In  it can be seen that retaining lip () locates and retains the shock absorber () within housing (). Voids () and () are provided for shock absorber () to be compressed into when panel () is positioned onto attachment system () and retaining bolt () fitted and fully tightened. In the centre of the lower surface of housing () a plate () with a threaded hole () is located and prevented from rotating by walls (). The plate () receives retaining bolt () and together with plate () they have limited movement in the longitudinal direction of panel () in the region of ±5 mm ( 3/16″). This arrangement accommodates any small movement of the superstructure () which can be caused for example by temperature changes.Mounting unit () constrains panel () in the Y axis and prevents Z axis rotation. Restraining bolt () constrains panel () in the vertical Z axis. Mounting unit () permits limited movement of panel (), in relation to mounting unit (), in the X axis and compensates for small movements within superstructure (). Shock absorbers () restrict minor movement in the Y axis and would permit movement in the X axis.Referring to  each panel () is attached to mounting system () and hence the bridge superstructure () by two retaining bolts (). In order to accommodate bolts () panel () has two stainless steel housings () which serve as attachment points moulded into the composite structure.In  attachment bolt () forms part of an assembly comprising of a washer (), a high rate compression spring (), a bolt head lock spring () and a sealing plug () which are typically made of nitrile rubber.Referring to  housing () provides multiple functions. To ensure housing () can transfer the loads imposed by bolt () into the composite structure of panel () the housing has flanges () and () which transfer load into composite laminates () and () which are an integral part of panel (). Housing () has a recess () which accommodates a washer (), a high rate compression spring (), the head of retaining bolt (), a bolt head lock spring () and sealing plug (). Attaching panel () to mounting system (), retaining bolt () is placed through compression spring () washer () into housing () and then through either mounting unit () or (). Retaining bolt () is then screwed into nut () and plate () respectively. Retaining bolts () are tightened to a specified torque value which preloads compression spring (). The hexagon head () of retaining bolt () is then locked in position by the insertion of the bolt head locking spring () into recess (). A sealing plug () is then inserted into recess ().In  the adjoining edges () of adjacent panels () are shaped to accommodate a seal (). The seal can take the form of either mastic, such as a polyurethane material injected into the gap or an elastomer seal bonded to the edge () of panel (). A suitable material would be an EPDM or nitrile rubber.The attachment system () has been shown to attach and fully constrain a panel () to a bridge superstructure () and also accommodate small movements within the superstructure () relative to panel (). Providing cavities () within the main beam structure which accommodate the attachment system () provides an additional safety feature in that if retaining bolt () was to fail it is unlikely that panel () would be dislodged as it is not reliant on bolt () because traffic automatically restrains movement of panel () in the vertical direction of the Z axis.The method of construction and assembly of this invention is as follows:Panels () are manufactured as individual units preferably in a very limited size range and typically would measure 600 mm×1200 mm×150 mm deep.Each panel () are complete with an integral wear surface () and housings ().The superstructure () may be fabricated within a factory. Attachment system () may be precision fitted to the appropriate members of superstructure (). On site the superstructure () may be assembled and when complete the panels () may be laid and sealed so as to create the decking and wear surface simultaneously. In this way a vehicle delivering panels () may advance along the bridge as the panels are laid in front of it.illustrates the assembly of a bridge in accordance with this invention. An array of superstructure beams () are provided with upwardly extending mounting units (, ) arranged in pairs to be received into sockets on the underside of panels () so that the panels abut to form a continuous surface.During the stages of assembly the panels may be laid on the superstructure to provide a working surface from which further panels may be laid. In this way a bridge may be assembled quickly without need for scaffolding. Application of a surface layer of bitumen is unnecessary. Panels may be removed individually for replacement as necessary without impeding use of adjacent panels.illustrate successive steps in the manufacture of a composite panel for use in accordance with this invention. A method as disclosed in WO2007/020618, the disclosure of which is incorporated into the present specification by reference for all purposes, is preferably employed.Laminate profiles () are precision cut from glass fibre fabric to specific design requirements of fibre quantities and orientations. Foam cores (), preferably made from polyurethane foam are moulded to the precise internal dimensions of the element of which they form a part. The cut laminate profiles which can range in number from 1 to more than 15 are assembled onto the foam core to make a beam () and held in place by stapling onto the foam core ().The beams () are then built into an assembly () as shown in .A laminate sheet () which serves to form the top face () of panel (), can consist of a number of fibre profiles, typically 10 or more, is placed into a jig. The beam assembly () is then precisely located onto laminate () which is then attached to the beam assembly by staples or by methods such as stitching and/or adhesive bonding, to create a completed perform () as shown in .is a cross section of ‘B″B’ through the panel shown in . The cores () are enclosed in laminate sheets (, ). The top layer () is integral with the bottom and side layers ().is a view of an eye bolt suitable to attach to panel.is a view of a modified eye bolt suitable to dislodge and remove panel.In the majority of applications when panels are installed there is no access to the lower face of the panel that would allow the panel to be lifted and removed. If the panel had become stuck to some degree over time to its mounting then the task of removing the panel would become even more difficult.To provide solutions to this problem the hole in flange () through which bolt () passes was provided with a thread () of sufficient size that would allow bolt () to pass through. Typically flange () would have a thread size of M20 and bolt () would be an M16.Providing a thread in flange () permits either an eye bolt () or modified eye bolt () to be attached. To remove a panel the procedure is to remove bolts () from the panel and replace them with eye bolts (). Lifting gear can then be used to dislodge and lift the panel. An alternative method is to use a modified eye bolt () having an elongate shank. When the bolt is screwed in to flange () the extended front end () passes through mounting (/) and contacts the superstructure (). Continuing to turn eye bolt () generates a separation force lifting panel () off mounting (/). Once the panel is separated the eye bolt () may be used to provide lifting means to fully remove the panel."

                "The present invention refers to a surface-cleaning machine with on-board operator, such as a floor washing-drying machine, a floor washing machine, a sweeper, a high-pressure cleaner, a vacuum cleaner, or similar machines, and, in particular, to a footboard of an operator's compartment on the surface-cleaning machine.A surface-cleaning machine with on-board operator is used to carry out basic cleaning and maintenance operations for every type of surface in an environment, such as for example a work space, an industrial space, a commercial space, a railway station, an airport terminal, a hospital, a nursing home, a health-care centre, etc.The surface-cleaning machine with on-board operator is built on a frame, in which a compartment is provided designed to accommodate an operator for using the machine.Such compartment for the operator comprises a seat and a footboard. The seat is arranged at a distance from the footboard in accordance with a predetermined anthropometric standard, to allow the operator to work in a sitting position, with the feet resting on the footboard. Control pedals operated controlled through the pressure from the operator's feet are arranged adjacent to the footboard.However, some operator could feel this predefined positioning of the seat with respect to the footboard as uncomfortable, especially when using a frequently used control pedal, such as a drive pedal, to control the forward speed and/or the direction of the surface-cleaning machine.In fact, as shown in , the operator on the conventional surface-cleaning machine usually actuates the frequently used control pedal while having a heel resting on the footboard. Consequently, the posture of the operator when operating the machine is conditioned by the predefined position of the seat with respect to the footboard, and this could be sensed by the operator as being an unsuitable posture if it does not closely correspond to the anthropometric measurements or the driving preferences of the particular operator.Therefore, one disadvantage in the conventional surface-cleaning machine with the on-board operator is that the postural ergonomics and comfort of the operator are not guaranteed, irrespective of the anthropometric measurements or the particular driving preferences of the operator.An objective of the subject matter of the present invention is to provide a surface-cleaning machine with on-board operator capable of overcoming the drawbacks of the prior art.Within the abovementioned objective, one purpose of the subject matter of the present invention is to achieve a surface-cleaning machine with on-board operator provided with an improved footboard in the operator's compartment in which the postural ergonomics and comfort the operator are guaranteed, irrespective of his/her anthropometric measurements and particular driving preferences.One no lesser objective is to provide a surface-cleaning machine with on-board operator that can be achieved with the usual well-known production means.The objective and the characteristics, as well as the above-mentioned purposes and advantages and others that will be better indicated hereunder are achieved by a surface-cleaning machine with on-board operator as defined in the independent claim and in the dependent claims of the present patent.With reference to the enclosed , a surface-cleaning machine with on-board operator according to the present invention is provided with a compartment  for the operator including a seat  and an improved footboard .The operator compartment  is used to accommodate an operator , who may operate the surface-cleaning machine through control pedals adjacent to the footboard  while sitting on the seat .According to the present invention, the footboard  defines a first fixed reference surface  for the operator's feet and includes at least one resting member  that defines a second foot-resting surface , in which the second resting surface  is adjustable relative to the first fixed reference surface .The footboard  is provided with a receptacle  that is shaped in such a manner as to at least partially accommodate the resting member . A peripheral surface of the receptacle  is threaded to form a nut screw .The receptacle  is housed in the footboard , preferably near a control pedal , so that the resting member  is in a position facing the control pedal  at a distance comparable to the size of an operator's foot .The control pedal  can be chosen from among pedals of types frequently used, such as a drive pedal to control a forward speed and/or the direction of the surface-cleaning machine, without thereby setting a limit for the present invention.According to one embodiment of the present invention, the resting member  consists of a bearing head , preferably of disk-like shape, whose perimeter includes the second resting surface  and a peripheral surface  opposite the second resting surface . From the peripheral surface , the bearing head  extends downward with a threaded stem  preferably of cylindrical shape and provided with a threaded side surface. The threaded stem  is surrounded by a spring , so that a first end portion  of the spring  is placed in contact with the peripheral surface  of the bearing head .The bearing head  may include a slot  arranged in the second resting surface  to enable a screw tightening/loosening tool to engage the slot .In addition, the bearing head  may include a plurality of bores  arranged in the second resting surface  to enable a manual engagement of the bearing head .The resting member  is at least partially inserted into the receptacle , with the threaded stem  screwed into the nut screw , so that a second end portion  of the spring  is placed into contact with a peripheral portion  of the receptacle , located in a position close to an end portion of the threaded stem .The insertion of the threaded stem  into the nut screw  can be adjusted by turning the bearing head  clockwise or counterclockwise by engaging the slot  with the screw tightening/loosening tool, or by operating manually on the plurality of bores , with adjustment intervals ranging from a minimum insertion to a maximum insertion of the threaded stem  with respect to the nut screw .The minimum insertion is, for example, one in which the second resting surface  protrudes from the first fixed reference surface  by an extent determined in the design phase, while the maximum insertion is, for example, one in which the second resting surface  is flush with the first fixed reference surface .However, this is not a binding condition in the present invention. In fact, the maximum insertion could be one in which the second resting surface  is retruded with respect to the first fixed reference surface  by an extent determined in the design phase.The adjustment of the depth of insertion of the threaded stem  into the nut screw  thus makes it possible to shift the second resting surface  with respect to the first fixed reference surface  by a desired level and this adjustment is maintained by friction on the threaded stem  thanks to a force applied by the spring , which urges with its first end portion  against the peripheral surface  of the bearing head  and with its second end portion  against the peripheral surface  of the receptacle .The operator  can therefore operate the control pedal  by resting a heel  on the second resting surface , that has been brought to a desired distance from the seat  held fixed with respect to the footboard .From the above it is therefore evident how the surface-cleaning machine with on-board operator according to the present invention achieves the initially set objective and purposes. In fact, a surface-cleaning machine with on-board operator is provided having an improved footboard  in the operator's compartment , wherein the sitting postural ergonomics and comfort of the operator  are guaranteed, independently of the anthropometric measurements or the particular driving preferences of the operator.In fact, the footboard  is equipped with a resting member  that makes it possible to adjust the distance between the second resting surface  supporting the heel  and the seat , which is maintained fixed with respect to the footboard .Naturally, the present invention is open to the possibility of numerous applications, changes, further embodiments or variants, without thereby departing from the scope of protection of the present patent application. In addition, all the applications, changes or further embodiments or variants contained in the present document, including those deducible therefrom, may be combined with each other."

                "The present invention relates to a brush for use in pre-surgery ophthalmic treatment. The soft-brush is designed to gently remove the soft cellular epithelium from the hard fibrous cornea prior to ophthalmic processes, such as vision corrective procedures.Laser-based surgical techniques have become increasingly more common for vision correction, and the removal of the cellular epithelium layer of the relatively hard fibrous cornea from the surface of the eyes is necessary in the preparation of such corrective surgeries.U.S. Pat. No. 5,649,943 (“Amoils”) discloses a device and method for removing the cellular epithelium layer. The present invention is a refinement and improvement of the brush used in the device and of the methods disclosed in Amoils, and accordingly applicant incorporates herewith the disclosure shown in the Amoils patent.Prior devices, such as Amoils, disclose a brush-head attaching directly to the rotating motor device, however the present invention allows for a two-piece brush system where a collar is attached directly to the rotating motor device, and a brush-head is securely inserted within the collar. This brush device allows for more versatility and efficiency by allowing a variety of brush-heads to be interchanged within a given collar, without removal of said collar.The present invention is a brush using a two-piece construction, a collar and a brush-head. The brush of the present invention is designed to overcome the problem of slipping when using a two-piece brush, so that the collar does not simply spin, while the brush-head remains in place.The collar of the present invention has a polygonal opening at the base designed to be compatible with the rotating polygonal shaft of a rotating motor device, such as that disclosed by Amoils. Said polygonal opening fits securely over the polygonal shaft attached to the rotating motor, such that when the motor is activated, the collar is caused to rotate. The other end (the top) of the collar, is an open cylindrical cavity of a diameter designed to precisely fit a line of specific sized brush-heads, and with a depth that is less than the length of the corresponding brush-heads, in order to allow a portion of the brush-head to protrude above the collar. It should be understood that a variety of brush-head and collar sizes can be accommodated according to their respective diameters.The brush-head of the present invention is comprised of a plurality of fine bristles bunched together in a cylindrical arrangement, and fused at one end, defining a diameter precisely designed to fit securely within the respectively sized collar. When in use, the fused end is inserted into the cylindrical cavity of the collar, where it is held securely in place. Accordingly, the diameter of the brush-head is nearly identical to that of the cavity in the collar, however it is ever-so-slightly smaller so that the brush-head will fit inside the cavity but it will be held snugly in place.The use of the fused end and the precise mating design of the brush-head and collar avoid any slippage when the collar is rotating, such that when the rotating motor device is activated, the collar and in-turn the brush-head will rotate accordingly.Different brushes are required for Myopic and Hyperotic corrective surgeries. And one can also imagine a need for variations in the convex curvature of the loose-end of the bristles in order to allow the brush to match the possible variations in the curvature of the patients' corneas. Accordingly, easy interchangeability of the brush-heads is advantageous in the field, and the present invention allows for easy substitution of one brush-head or another, while the collar remains fixed in place to the rotating motor device.According to the present invention, as detailed in , a brush () for use in ophthalmic treatment is comprised of a brush-head () and a separate color (). The brush is adapted for use with a rotating motor device (), as shown in . The rotating motor device () generally comprises a stem (), with a bent neck (), secured to a base (). Neck () terminates in a rotating shaft () that is adapted to hold and secure a brush, such as the brush () of the present invention.The brush-head () is comprised of a cylindrical bundle of bristles () fused together at one end () and loose on the other end (). Said cylindrical bundle defined by a diameter (Y) and a height (B). The fused end () of the brush forms a uniform end, and the loose end () of the brush is comprised of numerous individual bristles (). The bristles () on the loose end () form a generally convex surface, designed to form to the contour of the corneal surface of the eye, whereas the bristles () on the fused end () are fused together to form a uniform, generally flat surface designed to be inserted into the open end () of collar ().The collar () is a rigid molded piece having a generally cylindrical shape with a first end () and second end (). The second end () including a means for attaching () the collar to the rotating shaft () of a rotating motor device (), such as the device disclosed in Amoils, or as shown in . Said means is a polygonal opening () designed specifically to mate with the securing end of a rotating shaft (). In the preferred embodiment of collar (), the second end () has a hexagonal opening (), which is designed to conform with a corresponding hexagonal rotating shaft (), at the end of the a rotating motor device (). It should be understood that the opening () and the rotating shaft () can be any corresponding non-circular polygonal shape, such as a triangle, rectangle, or star-shape.The first end () of the collar () includes a recessed cylindrical cavity designed to receive and securely hold the fused end () of the brush-head () in place. Said cylindrical cavity defined by a diameter (X) and a depth (A). The cavity at the first end () and the brush-head () are designed cylindrically with matching diameters (X and Y respectively), such that any brush-head () of the appropriate diameter (Y) is easily interchangeable with said collar ()."

                "This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/012,068, filed Jan. 31, 2008, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/899,280 filed on Feb. 2, 2007, which is incorporated here by reference. This patent relates to electric toothbrushes and in particular to a brush section for an electric toothbrush.An electric toothbrush may incorporate a brush section that couples to a handle section. A drive shaft may extend from the handle section with the drive shaft being coupled to an electric drive disposed within an interior of the handle section. The electric drive may impart a rotary, oscillating or combined rotary oscillating motion to the drive shaft so that the drive shaft is movable in a rotary or oscillating manner. The brush section can couple and secure to the handle section with the drive shaft coupling to a coupling element of the brush section, e.g., a shaft or drive pin. The motion of the drive shaft can be imparted upon the coupling element to provide a desired cleaning action to a brush head portion of the brush section.A common arrangement for a brush section includes a substantially circular brush head portion. The brush head is caused, by action of the electric drive, to have a rotary or rotary-oscillating motion, i.e., cleaning motion during cleaning use. The circular brush head design combined with the cleaning motion is very effective for cleaning teeth and is optimal when a tooth-by-tooth cleaning pattern is used. Still, many consumers enjoy taking a proactive role in their oral hygiene activity. At times, the user will use the electric toothbrush with a manual brushing action, e.g., using vertical or circular strokes. For the electric toothbrush having a circular brush head design and employing a rotary or rotary-oscillating cleaning motion, using this electric toothbrush with a manual brushing action can be counter productive and may reduce the effectiveness of the brush head design and cleaning action. Ironically, the electric toothbrush is rendered less effective while the consumer erroneously believes the added action makes for a more effective and/or expedited cleaning process. Furthermore, years of training and conditioning have taught the consumer to use a circular or vertical cleaning motion, and habits may be difficult to change.A brush section for use with an electric toothbrush includes a brush head portion which may have a generally rectangular shape, although oblong, elliptical, or any suitable shape may be employed. Generally, the brush head portion may have a length-to-width aspect ratio greater than 1, although such an arrangement is not required. The brush head portion is secured to a tube member of the brush section that may be configured to couple to a handle section. The handle section may include an electric drive including a drive shaft, and the drive shaft may couple to the brush head via a coupling or drive pin member positioned within the tube member. In some embodiments, the electric drive may impart a rotary, oscillating, rotary-oscillating or other suitable drive motion to the drive shaft that is, in turn, imparted upon the brush head and bristle members thereof by virtue of the coupling member.The brush head may incorporate a first plurality of cleaning bristles that are static, i.e., fixed relative to the brush head and a second plurality of cleaning bristles that are moveable in a cleaning motion relative to the first plurality of bristles. For example, the second plurality of cleaning bristles may include a bristle support structure or bristle holder that is supported within the brush head to have at least one direction of freedom to move relative to the brush head and the first plurality of bristles. In one embodiment, the bristle support structure may be free to pivot about a first axis relative to the brush head. The coupling member couples the bristle support structure to the electric drive for driving the bristle support structure causing the second plurality of bristles to have the desired cleaning motion. The bristle support structure may comprise a plurality of separate bristle support structures such that each structure may move independently with respect to each other separate bristle support structure. Furthermore, the cleaning motion may include an eccentric motion or translational motion in combination with a rotary, oscillating or other suitable cleaning motion.It will be understood and appreciated that while various aspects, features and advantages of the invention are described in connection with particular embodiments, the herein described aspects, features and advantages may be implemented in any of the embodiments, and as such, the features and structures of the various embodiments may be mixed and matched yielding a virtually limitless number of combinations. One of skill in the art will furthermore appreciate that the herein described aspects, features and advantages of the invention may be combined with structures and devices known to or later discovered by the skilled artisan.The herein described embodiments of brush sections are suited to operate in conjunction with an electric toothbrush, such for example, as an electric toothbrush of the type having a handle section including an electric drive and a drive shaft having a longitudinal axis. The electric drive imparts a motion to the drive shaft. It may, for example, impart a rotary, oscillating, or rotary and oscillating motion to the drive shaft. The motion of the drive shaft is coupled to the brush section to impart a desired motion to a brush head portion of the brush section such that the brush head portion, or any component thereof, is caused to have a desired cleaning motion. Many different kinds of cleaning motions, including rotary, oscillating, vertical and/or horizontal sweeping and the like, may be used. Generally, as used herein, cleaning motion describes any desired or effective movement of the bristles relative to the brush head to affect cleaning. Handle sections, as described above, are well known to the skilled artisan. In addition, the brush sections may be configured for use with such existing handle sections or may be configured with new handle sections types, as the case may be.illustrate a brush section  which may be push-fitted onto a toothbrush handle section and coupled to the drive shaft of the handle section, such for example, as a handle section described above. The brush section includes a mounting tube  extending along an axis . The axis  is a longitudinal axis of the cleaning section and may coincide with a longitudinal section of the drive shaft  (). At a first end  (), the mounting tube  may include a profile ring  having an inside contour complementary with an outside contour of the handle section. In this manner, the brush section  can be push-fitted onto the handle section in a manner preventing relative rotation of the brush section with respect to the handle section. A tab/slot, key/spline or other similar structure may be included in the corresponding contour surfaces to facilitate alignment of the brush section with the handle section and to further prevent relative rotation between the two.At a second end  the brush section  includes a brush head portion . In some embodiments, the brush head portion  supports a first plurality of contact elements  that are mounted to the head portion  so as to be fixed, i.e., they are static relative to the head portion . Any suitable method of mounting the first plurality of contact elements  to the head portion  may be used. For example, where the contact elements  comprise a plurality of bristles, methods, such as hot tufting, gluing, stapling, and the like, may be utilized. As another example, where the contact elements  comprise a plurality of elastomeric elements, methods such as gluing, snap-fitting, welding, molding, etc. may be utilized.Supported within the head portion  is a movable contact element support or moveable contact element holder  supporting a second plurality of contact elements . The second plurality of contact elements  may be mounted to the movable contact element holder  using any suitable method, as described above with regard to the first plurality of contact elements . The movable contact element holder  may be supported within the head portion  such that it is able to rotate about the longitudinal axis  responsive to a suitable driving input from the handle section.The first plurality of contact elements  may have a first height and the second plurality of contact elements  may have a second height, different than the first height. Additionally, the ends of the first and second pluralities of contact elements  and  may have contoured, rounded or otherwise shaped ends. Among the first plurality of contact elements  and the second plurality of contact elements , contact elements or tufts of bristles (in embodiments where the contact elements comprise a plurality of bristles) at different locations of the head portion , e.g. front to back and/or center to edge, may also have different heights and different bristle end contours.The first plurality of contact elements  may be arranged in rows transverse relative to the axis . Similarly, the second plurality of contact elements  may be arranged in rows transverse relative to the axis . In some embodiments, the transverse rows may alternate between rows of first plurality of contact elements  and rows of second plurality of contact elements . In some embodiments, multiple rows of the first plurality of contact elements may be separated by a row or multiple rows of the second plurality of contact elements  and vice versa or the rows may be interleaved or arranged in virtually any manner.As shown in , in some embodiments, the head portion  may include a first bearing surface  that engages a recess, notch, slot or other suitable formation  formed in the movable contact element holder . As shown, in some embodiments, the recess, notch, slot, or other suitable formation  may be disposed between the second plurality of contact elements  and a third plurality of contact elements .A drive shaft  may engage the movable contact element holder  such that movement of the drive shaft  can be transferred to the movable contact element holder . The drive shaft  may be supported within the mounting tube  at a rearward end  of the head portion . The drive shaft  may be joined to the contact element holder  via any suitable means. For example, as shown, the drive shaft  may be joined to the movable contact element holder  via a drive pin . As yet another example, the drive shaft  may be joined to the movable contact element holder  adhesively, chemically, mechanically, electrically, e.g. magnetic clutch, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the drive pin  may be inserted into the movable contact element holder  and/or the drive shaft  via corresponding apertures in the movable contact holder  and/or drive shaft .As shown in , the movable contact element holder  (shown in ) may be snap-fitted into the head portion  via an opening . The opening  may then be closed with a snap-in-place housing member (not depicted).In the embodiment shown in , the movable contact element holder  may include an extension portion  supporting the third plurality of contact elements . The extension portion  may be supported to permit at least one freedom of motion relative to the head portion . For example, the extension portion  may be supported to rotate relative to the head portion . In this manner, the third plurality of contact elements  may move in a cleaning motion relative to the first plurality of contact elements  and/or the second plurality of contact elements . For example, the extension portion  may couple to the movable bristle holder  such that the third plurality of contact elements  moves in a similar manner as the second plurality of contact elements .In other embodiments, the brush head portion  comprises the extension portion  and the third plurality of contact elements . In such embodiments, the third plurality of contact elements  may be stationary with respect to the brush head portion .Referring back to , in some embodiments, the coupling between the extension portion  and the movable contact element holder  may be direct such that the extension portion  moves with the movable contact element holder . However, in some embodiments, the extension portion  may couple to the drive pin , directly, via a cam arrangement, a linkage or otherwise, and/or to the movable contact element holder  or otherwise such that the extension portion  has a cleaning motion that is separate from a cleaning motion of the movable contact element holder  and the second plurality of contact elements .In the embodiment shown if , the movable contact element holder  may oscillate about the axis  thereby causing the second plurality of contact elements  and/or the third plurality of contact elements  to similarly oscillate about the axis . The movement of the movable contact element holder  may cause the second plurality of contact elements  and/or the third plurality of contact elements  to oscillate back and forth angularly to provide a cleaning action substantially similar to an up-down manual brushing action.The amount of angular movement as well as the speed exhibited by the movable contact element holder  and the second plurality of contact elements  and/or the third plurality of contact elements  can impact the efficacy of the cleaning action. Generally, oscillation angle within the range of 40-60 degrees is considered beneficial. For example, the movable contact element holder  may move through an angle of about 44 degrees, i.e., +/−22 degrees relative to the head portion , in some embodiments. Another example includes 55 degrees angle. However, any suitable angle may be utilized. For example, other angles greater than 55 degrees or less than 44 degrees may be used.In some embodiments, the movable contact element holder  can move through an angle of from about 10 degrees to about 90 degrees, or any individual number within the range. In some embodiments, the movable contact element holder  can move through an angle greater than about 10 degrees, greater than about 12 degrees, greater than about 15 degrees, greater than about 18 degrees, greater than about 20 degrees, greater than about 22.5 degrees, greater than about 25 degrees, greater than about 30 degrees, greater than about 35 degrees, greater than about 40 degrees, greater than about 45 degrees, greater than about 50 degrees, greater than about 55, greater than about 60 degrees, greater than about 65 degrees, greater than about 70 degrees, greater than about 75 degrees, greater than about 80 degrees, greater than about 85 degrees, and/or less than about 90 degrees, less than about 85 degrees, less than about 80 degrees, less than about 75 degrees, less than about 70 degrees, less than about 65 degrees, less than about 60 degrees, less than about 55 degrees, less than about 50 degrees, less than about 45 degrees, less than about 40 degrees, less than about 35 degrees, less than about 30 degrees, less than about 25 degrees, less than about 22.45 degrees, less than about 20 degrees, less than about 18 degrees, less than about 15 degrees, less than about 12 degrees, or less than about 10 degrees.As stated above, the speed at which the movable contact element holder  and the second plurality of contact elements  and/or the third plurality of contact elements  move through their angular movement may also impact the efficacy of the cleaning action. For example, a speed of about 75 Hz may provide adequate cleaning where the movable contact element holder  moves through an angle of about 44 degrees. In general, where the movable contact element holder  moves through a smaller angle, the speed at which the movable contact element holder  moves through the angle may increase in order to maintain cleaning efficacy.The movable contact element holder  may move through its respective angle at a speed ranging from between about 30 Hz to about 130 Hz, or any individual number within the range. In some embodiments, the movable contact element holder  may move through its respective angle at a speed of greater than about 30 Hz, greater than about 40 Hz, greater than about 50 Hz, greater than about 60 Hz, greater than about 70 Hz, greater than about 80 Hz, greater than about 90 Hz, greater than about 100 Hz, greater than about 110 Hz, greater than about 120 Hz, and/or less than about 130 Hz, less than about 120 Hz, less than about 110 Hz, less than about 100 Hz, less than about 90 Hz, less than about 80 Hz, less than about 70 Hz, less than about 60 Hz, less than about 50 Hz, or less than about 40 Hz.Advantageously, with the movement of the second plurality of contact elements  and/or the movement of the third plurality of contact elements , and a manually imparted cleaning movement of the overall head portion , the user may experience an enhanced and effective cleaning action. Furthermore, instead of the user's manual manipulation of the toothbrush incorporating the brush section  drawing away from, and degrading, the driven cleaning action, the two actions may combine to provide an enhanced cleaning affect. Also, in the event that the handle section becomes discharged and thus the electric drive becomes disabled, the brush section  may be easily used in the same manner as a manual toothbrush to affect cleaning.In some embodiments, the brush section  may comprise a transponder, and the handle section may comprise a detector or a reading device as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2004/0255409 and 2003/0101526. The transponder can be configured to communicate information about the brush section  to the detector or reading device. The reading device or detector can be in signal communication with a controller which may be configured to control the speed of a motor and/or the angular motion of a shaft of the motor. The basic architecture of a controller, reading device, detector, and/or transponder is generally known.The speed of the motor as well as the angle which of oscillatory shaft displacement can be controlled in any suitable manner. For example, one means of modifying the speed of the motor is to increase or decrease the voltage to the motor. Typically, an increase in voltage will increase the speed of the motor while a decrease in voltage will decrease the speed of the motor. Such mechanisms for modifying the voltage delivered to motors are well known. As another example, the speed of the motor may be modified via a transmission system.illustrate one embodiment of a transmission system. A transmission system  may comprise a drive system . The drive system  may comprise a motor  having a shaft . The shaft  may be operatively connected to a first driver  and/or a second driver . In a first configuration, the teeth of the first driver  may be intermeshed with teeth from a plurality of planetary gears , , and/or . In a second configuration, the teeth of the second driver  may be intermeshed with teeth from a plurality of planetary gears , , and/or .As shown, the first driver  and/or the second driver  as well as their respective planetary gears may be disposed on a gear carrier . The planetary gears may be rotatably connected to the gear carrier .A ring gear  may comprise complementary teeth to those of the planetary gears. As such, the teeth of the ring gear  may intermesh with the teeth of the planetary gears. In some embodiments, an output shaft  may be operatively connected to the ring gear . In such embodiments, the ring gear  may be driven at various speeds depending on the size of the driver gear and its respective planetary gears. For example, as shown, the first driver  may have a smaller diameter than the second driver . As such, the corresponding planetary gears, e.g. , , and/or  may have larger diameters than the first driver . So, in the first configuration, for a predetermined rotational speed of the motor shaft , the ring gear  may have a rotational speed which is less than the rotational speed of the motor shaft . In contrast, in the second configuration, for a predetermined rotational speed of the motor shaft , the ring gear  may have a rotational speed which is greater than the rotational speed of the motor shaft . In the second configuration, the second driver  may have a diameter which is greater than the diameter of its respective planetary gears, e.g. , , and/or . The selection of the first driver  and/or the second driver  may be created via a clutch system or any other suitable means.In some embodiments, the first driver  and/or the second driver  may be operatively connected to the output shaft . In such embodiments, the ring gear  may be driven by the shaft  while the gear carrier  remains stationary. Alternatively, the gear carrier  may be driven by the shaft  while the ring gear  remains stationary.Additionally, as stated previously, the angle may be modified in any suitable manner. For example, as shown in , the transmission system  may further comprise an output system . Embodiments are contemplated where devices of the present invention include the drive system  and/or the output system .As shown in , the output system  may comprise a shaft , a first driver linkage , a first driven linkage , a second driver linkage , a second driven linkage , and an output shaft . The shaft  may be operatively connected to a motor such that the shaft  is driven by the motor. The first driver linkage  and the second driver linkage  may be connected to the shaft  such that the first driver linkage  and the second driver linkage  are capable of rotating with respect to the shaft .The first driver linkage  may be pivotally connected to the first driven linkage  via pin , in some embodiments. Similarly, the second driver linkage  may be pivotally connected to the second driven linkage  via a pin, in some embodiments.The first driven linkage  comprises at least one engagement element  which is capable of intermeshing with a first receiving element . As shown, the engagement element  may comprise a tooth, and the receiving element  may comprise a recessed area for receiving the tooth of the engagement element . The receiving element  may be fixed to the output shaft  such that rotational motion imparted to the receiving element  may thereby be transferred to the output shaft .Similarly, the second driven linkage  may comprise at least one engagement element  which is capable of intermeshing with a second receiving element . The at least one engagement element  of the second driven linkage  and the second receiving element  may be configured as described above with regard to the engagement element  and receiving element . The second receiving element  may be fixed to the output shaft  such that rotational motion imparted to the second receiving element  may be transferred to the output shaft .The first driver linkage  and the first driven linkage  may have different lengths in order to impart a particular angular displacement to the output shaft . In some embodiments, the first driver linkage  and the first driven linkage  may have equal lengths. The second driver linkage  and the second driven linkage  may be similarly configured. The analysis of the relative lengths of the linkages to achieve a particular displacement is founded on principles which are generally well known, e.g. four bar linkage analysis.As shown in , when the first engagement element  is engaged with the first receiving element , the output shaft  may have a first angular displacement. The first angular displacement may be similar to the angular displacement described heretofore. In this configuration, the second engagement element  may be disengaged with the second receiving element .As shown in , when the second engagement element  is engaged with the second receiving element , the output shaft  may have a second angular displacement. The second angular displacement may be similar to the angular displacement described heretofore. However, the first angular displacement may be different from the second angular displacement. For example, the first angular displacement may be greater than the second angular displacement. As another example, the first angular displacement may be less than the second angular displacement.Referring to  another embodiment of a brush section  is shown. Like elements of the brush section  to those of the brush section  are indicated using a reference numeral incremented by 100. The brush section  includes a mounting tube  extending along an axis . At a first end (not depicted), the mounting tube  is adapted to be push-fitted onto a handle section in a manner preventing relative rotation, as discussed previously with regard to the mounting tube .At a second end  the brush section  includes a brush head portion . The brush head portion  supports a first plurality of contact elements  that are mounted to the head portion  so as to be fixed, i.e., static relative to the head portion . Any suitable method of mounting the first plurality of contact elements  to the head portion  may be used, such as those methods discussed heretofore with regard to the first plurality of contact elements . Supported within the head portion  is a movable contact element support or moveable contact element holder  supporting a second plurality of contact elements . The second plurality of contact elements  may be mounted to the movable contact element holder  using any suitable method, such as those discussed heretofore with regard to the second plurality of contact elements . The movable contact element holder  may be supported within the head portion  such that the movable contact element holder  is able to rotate about the axis  responsive to a suitable driving input from a handle section.The first plurality of contact elements  may have a first height and the second plurality of contact elements  may have a second height, different than the first height. Additionally, the ends of the first and second pluralities of contact elements  and  may have contoured, rounded or otherwise shaped ends. Among the first plurality of contact elements  and the second plurality of contact elements , contact elements at different locations of the head portion  front to back and center to edge may also have different heights and different end contours. The first plurality of contact elements  may be arranged in rows transverse relative to the axis . Similarly, the second plurality of contact elements  may be arranged in rows transverse relative to the axis .As shown in , the movable contact elements holder  may include a plurality of separately moveable contact element holder portions , each supporting a portion of the second plurality of contact elements . For example, each contact element holder portion  may support a separate transverse row of the second plurality of contact elements . The drive shaft  may extend through the head portion  and may be rotatably supported in an end member . The drive shaft  can be adapted to engage a drive member of a handle portion to which the brush section  is configured to operatively couple. Each movable contact element holder portion  may couple to the drive shaft  such that oscillation of the drive shaft  causes a like oscillation of the respective contact element portion . Each contact element holder portion  may be snap-fitted into the head portion  via an aperture  (shown in ) and engaged with the drive shaft . A housing member (not depicted) may be provided to enclose the aperture . Additionally, the contact element holder portions  may be snap-fitted from a front side of the head portion .As noted, each contact element holder portion  may be linked directly to the drive shaft  and thus to have an oscillating angular cleaning motion. Alternatively, at least some of the contact element holder portions  may be coupled by a linkage, cam structure or the like such that the contact element holder portion  has a cleaning motion separate from a rotating motion of the drive shaft  and/or a separate cleaning motion from other contact element holder portions .In the embodiment shown if , each of the second plurality of contact elements  may be driven to oscillate back and forth angularly about the axis  to provide a cleaning action simulating an up-down manual brushing action. The second plurality of contact elements  may move through an angle of about 44 degrees, +/−22 degrees relative to the head portion . However, other angles greater than 44 degrees or less than 44 degrees may be used. In the embodiments described in , any suitable angle may be utilized similar to those disclosed heretofore with regard to .In a similarly advantageous manner, the cleaning movement of the second plurality of contact elements  and a manually imparted cleaning movement of the head portion  by the user may provide an enhanced and effective cleaning action without drawing away from or degrading the driven cleaning action. The brush section  is also easily used in the same manner as a manual toothbrush to affect cleaning.It is noted with respect to the brush section  that at least some of the contact element holder portions  may be separately coupled to the drive shaft  via a linkage, cam or similar structure to have a cleaning motion separate from a oscillating motion of the drive shaft . For example, as shown in , the drive shaft  may comprise a plurality of cams  offset from or eccentric relative to the axis . In some embodiments, each bristle holder portion  may be rotatably supported by engagement of a circular aperture  with a pin  formed on a static bristle support , a plurality of which, potentially corresponding to the number of rows of the first plurality of bristles , may be formed on the head section . Each cam  may engage a slot  formed in the bristle support portion  such that rotation of the drive shaft  causes a back and forth angular rotation of the bristle support portion  and the associated second plurality of bristles . Arrangement of the cams  on the drive shaft  permits each bristle holder portion  to have a separate rotating motion, which may enhance the cleaning action of the head section .Advantageously, a complex drive motion of the drive shaft  may be avoided, as it may be driven in rotation with the action of the cam  engaging the bristle support portion  to provide the desired cleaning motion for the second plurality of bristles . For example, some embodiments may utilize a drive shaft which oscillates back and forth about the axis  to achieve the oscillatory motion of the first plurality of contact elements, the second plurality of contact elements, and/or the third plurality of contact elements. As yet another example, some embodiments, may utilize a drive shaft which rotates about the axis  to achieve the oscillatory motion of the first plurality of contact elements, the second plurality of contact elements, and/or the third plurality of contact elements.As shown in , an alternate arrangement of the bristle holder portions , designated as bristle holder portions ′ is contemplated. As shown, each bristle holder portion ′ may be rotatably supported on the pin . However, instead of being formed with a circular aperture  (shown in ), the bristle holder portion ′ may be formed with a slot ′ which engages the pin . Additionally, the slot  (shown in ) may be formed as a circular opening ′ within which the cam  rotates with rotation of the drive shaft . Rotation of the drive shaft  causes a back and forth angular rotation of the bristle support portion ′ and the associated second plurality of bristles . Additionally, the bristle support portions ′ may be driven linearly along the slot ′ relative to the axis . This arrangement of bristle support portions ′ permits each bristle holder portion ′ to have a rotating and translating motion, which may enhance the cleaning action of the head section . Also, arrangement of the cams  on the drive shaft  may allow each individual bristle holder portion ′ to have a motion separate and distinct from each other bristle holder portion ′. The resulting relatively complex cleaning motion may be imparted to the second plurality of bristles  without a complex drive motion of the drive shaft , which may be driven in rotation.illustrates yet another alternate arrangement of the bristle holder portions , designated as bristle holder portions ″. Each bristle holder portion ″ may be formed with an arcuate slot ″ that engages a corresponding pin  formed on a static bristle support. The drive shaft  may include eccentric cams such that rotation of the drive shaft  may provide rotating and translating motion of the bristle holder portions ″ via engagement of the drive shaft  with the respective bristle holder portions ″. Additionally, this arrangement may provide separate and distinct rotational and translation motion for each bristle holder portion ″ without a complex drive motion of the drive shaft .As described, the various arrangements of a bristle holder portion, e.g., , ′ and ′, etc., permit relatively complex rotational and translational cleaning motions to be imparted to the second plurality of bristles . This may be accomplished with a simple rotating motion of the drive shaft  making brush sections  incorporating these configurations easily adaptable to existing handle section designs that may provide only for a rotating drive shaft output.The first plurality of contact elements , the second plurality of contact elements , and/or the third plurality of contact elements  of the present invention may comprise a wide variety of materials and may have a number of different configurations. Any suitable material and/or any suitable configuration may be utilized.For example, in some embodiments, the first plurality of contact elements , the second plurality of contact elements , and/or the third plurality of contact elements , may comprise tufts. The tufts may comprise a plurality of individual filaments which are securely attached to a cleaning element carrier. Such filaments may be polymeric and may include polyamide or polyester. The longitudinal and cross sectional dimensions of the filaments of the invention and the profile of the filament ends can vary. Additionally, the stiffness, resiliency and shape of the filament end can vary. Some examples of suitable dimensions include a length between about 3 cm to about 6 cm, or any individual number within the range. Additionally, the filaments may include a substantially uniform cross-sectional dimension of between about 100 to about 350 microns, or any individual number within the range. The tips of the filaments may be any suitable shape, examples of which include a smooth tip, a rounded tip, a pointed tip. In some embodiments, the filaments may include a dye which indicates wear of the filaments as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,802,255. Other suitable examples of filaments are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,018,840. In some embodiments, the cleaning element fields may comprise fins as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,553,604; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0177462; 2005/0235439; and 2005/0060822. In some embodiments, the cleaning element fields may comprise a combination of fins and tufts.Additionally, at least a portion of some of the first plurality of contact elements , the second plurality of contact elements , and/or the third plurality of contact elements  may be attached to a cleaning element carrier at an angle. Such orientations are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,308,367. Also, any suitable method may be utilized to attach the first plurality of contact elements , the second plurality of contact elements , and/or the third plurality of contact elements  to their respective structures.Embodiments are contemplated where the mounting tube ,  (shown in  and -, respectively, is angled with respect to the handle section. In such embodiments, the drive shaft of the present invention may be provided in discrete portions thereby accommodating the angle of the mounting tube , . For example, the drive shaft may include one or more universal joints. As yet another example, the drive shaft may be constructed from a compliant material. Some examples of suitable materials for construction of the drive shaft include aluminum, spring steel, plastics, e.g. delrin, nylon, polypropylene, and/or combinations thereof.The dimensions and values disclosed herein are not to be understood as being strictly limited to the exact numerical values recited. Instead, unless otherwise specified, each such dimension is intended to mean both the recited value and a functionally equivalent range surrounding that value. For example, a dimension disclosed as “40 mm” is intended to mean “about 40 mm”.All documents cited in the Detailed Description of the Invention are, in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference; the citation of any document is not to be construed as an admission that it is prior art with respect to the present invention. To the extent that any meaning or definition of a term in this document conflicts with any meaning or definition of the term in a document incorporated by reference, the meaning or definition assigned to the term in this written document shall govern.While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of this invention.The following text sets forth a broad description of numerous different embodiments of the present invention.

                "The following disclosure relates generally to autonomous camera systems and, more particularly, to embodiments of an automated camera cleaning system well-suited for deployment onboard a remotely-operated robot or vehicle.Video cameras and other optical imaging devices are often deployed onboard remotely-controlled vehicles, robots, and the like to provide streaming video feeds to one or more remotely-stationed operators. For example, commercial passenger vehicles utilized during military targeting maneuvers (commonly referred to as “high speed moving targets”) are commonly retrofitted with at least one video camera, a wireless transceiver, and other specialized equipment, which enable remotely-stationed personnel to operate the vehicle in a desired manner High speed moving targets are often operated in flat, dry areas (e.g., dried lake beds or desert terrains), which tend to release large amounts of dust and other debris into the air as the ground is disturbed by movement of the moving targets and by detonation of munitions. The airborne debris may accumulate over the camera lens, obstruct the camera's forward-looking field-of-view, and thereby interfere with remote-operation of the high speed moving target. Operation of the high speed moving targets may consequently be halted, and manual cleaning of the camera lens may be required before targeting maneuvers can be resumed. Manual cleaning of a camera deployed onboard a high speed moving target can be a cumbersome and time-consuming process, which may require that a technician or other personnel member depart from a safe zone, travel several miles to the location at which the high speed vehicles are being operated, manually clean the camera lens, and then again travel several miles to return to the safe zone. Similar inconveniences are also entailed in the manual cleaning of cameras deployed onboard other remotely-operated vehicles and robots including, for example, Unmanned Airborne Vehicles included within Unmanned Aircraft Systems.One widely-known automated camera cleaning system, commonly utilized in conjunction with traffic photo-enforcement cameras, includes a housing containing a camera; a transparent panel, which provides a line-of-sight through the housing; a wiper blade, which is pivotally mounted to the exterior of the housing adjacent the transparent panel; and a motor, which intermittently moves the wiper blade across the outer surface of the transparent panel to clear away dust, water, and other substances that accumulate thereon. While generally satisfactory for usage in conjunction with stationary photo-enforcement cameras, such externally-mounted wiper systems are generally unsuitable for deployment onboard remotely-controlled vehicles and robots of the type described above. As the wiper blade clears debris from the outer surface of the transparent pane, the wiper blade temporarily obstructs the camera's field-of-view. When the camera is utilized to provide a remotely-located operator with a nearly instantaneous or “real-time” video feed, temporary obstruction of the camera's field-of-view can be distracting to the remote operator and may be unacceptable in certain mission scenarios. Furthermore, externally-mounted wiper systems of the type described above only intermittently clear away debris deposited over the camera lens. As a result, conventional wiper systems may not clear away debris with sufficient efficiency in scenarios wherein a large amount of debris is suddenly deposited over the camera lens due to, for example, a neighboring detonation. While the frequency with which the wiper blade sweeps across the transparent panel can be increased, this results in a corresponding increase in the frequency with the wiper blade obstructs the camera's field-of-view.It is thus desirable to provide embodiments of an automated camera cleaning system that continually removes debris deposited over a camera lens without obstructing the camera's field-of-view. It would also be desirable if, in certain embodiments, the automated camera cleaning system deterred or prevented the accumulation of ice and/or water over the camera lens. Lastly, it would be desirable for such an automated camera cleaning system to be relatively rugged and to operate reliably in relatively harsh operating conditions characterized by, for example, prolonged sun exposure or freezing temperatures. Other desirable features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent Detailed Description and the appended Claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying Drawings and this Background.Embodiments of an automated camera cleaning system are provided. In one embodiment, the automated camera cleaning system includes an optical path, an optically-transmissive lens shield through which the optical path extends, a housing in which the optically-transmissive lens shield is at least partially disposed, and a motor coupled to the lens shield. When energized, the motor moves the optically-transmissive lens shield relative to the housing to vary the region of the optically-transmissive lens shield positioned in the optical path.The following Detailed Description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding Background or the following Detailed Description. As appearing herein, the term “camera” is utilized in a broad sense to denote any optical sensor that detects radiation within the visible, infra-red, or other band of the electromagnetic spectrum including, but not limited to, daytime and nighttime video cameras, synthetic aperture radar sensors, and infrared (e.g., thermographic) cameras.are isometric and side views, respectively, of an automated camera cleaning system  in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. As will be explained more fully below, automated camera cleaning system  continually removes dust and other debris that accumulates over the lens of a camera without obstructing the camera's field-of-view. Embodiments of automated camera cleaning system  also prevent the build-up of ice and remove condensation from over the camera lens or, more specifically, from a protective lens shield positioned over the camera lens. As a still further advantage, automated camera cleaning system  is relatively rugged and can operate reliably in harsh operating conditions characterized by, for example, prolonged sun exposure or freezing temperatures. Considering these attributes, automated camera cleaning system  is well-suited for deployment onboard a remotely-operated robot or vehicle, such as an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle or a high speed moving target of the type described. In addition, embodiments of automated camera cleaning system  may be useful for deployment within operating environments wherein large amounts of dust or other particulate matter is airborne and tends to accumulate over the lens of a camera. For example, embodiments of cleaning system  may be especially useful for deployment onboard military convoys to provide streaming video feeds to increase situational awareness of a surrounding area; for deployment in stationary camera assemblies exposed to rain, snow, sunlight, and other weather conditions; and for deployment in stationary camera assemblies utilized to monitor machining or other manufacturing operations that tend to release large amounts of sawdust, metal particles, or other debris into the surrounding air. This notwithstanding, embodiments of automated camera cleaning system  are scalable and can be utilized within a wide variety of different platforms and operating environments.Automated camera cleaning system  includes, or is configured to be utilized in conjunction with, at least one camera. For example, as indicated in , automated camera cleaning system  may include a single camera , such as a daytime or nighttime video camera, which may be mounted to a lens shield housing  included within automated camera cleaning system . In embodiments wherein automated camera cleaning system  includes at least one dedicated camera, such as video camera , the housing of the camera or cameras can be integrally formed with lens shield housing  to yield a single, relatively lightweight, and relatively rugged unit. Conversely, in embodiments wherein cleaning system  is not packaged with at least one dedicated camera, automated camera cleaning system  may be configured to enable any one of a number of different commercially-available cameras to be mounted to lens shield housing  utilizing, for example, a universal mounting bracket or similar mounting means. In this manner, a user can first purchase automated camera cleaning system , select a desired “off-the-shelf” camera, and then mount the selected camera to cleaning system  for subsequent usage.are front and rear exploded views, respectively, of automated camera cleaning system . In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in , lens shield housing  includes two primary components, namely, a main housing member  and a cover piece . Main housing member  assumes the form of a relatively shallow cylindrical body having a generally circular back wall  (shown in ); an annular sidewall , which extends around an outer circumference of circular back wall ; and a generally cylindrical cavity  (shown in ). Cover piece  has a generically circular geometry and is joined to annular sidewall  of main housing member  to enclose cavity . As indicated in , cover piece  can be attached to annular sidewall  of main housing member  utilizing a plurality of bolts  or other such fasteners. Main housing member  and cover piece  are each conveniently formed from a relatively lightweight metal or alloy, such as aluminum. The foregoing notwithstanding, the number of components included within lens shield housing , the shape and dimensions of the components included within housing , the material or materials from which the components of housing  are produced, and the manner in which the components of housing  are joined will inevitably vary amongst different embodiments.A front aperture  (shown in , , and ) is provided through cover piece , and a rear aperture  (shown in ) is provided through back wall  of main housing member . When automated camera cleaning system  is assembled, front aperture  and rear aperture  align, as taken along the longitudinal axis of lens shield housing , to partially define an optical path  through lens shield housing . When camera  is mounted to back wall  of main housing member  in the above-described manner, optical path  provides camera  with a line-of-sight through lens shield housing . As shown most clearly in , automated camera cleaning system  further includes an optically-transmissive lens shield  through which optical path  extends. Optically-transmissive lens shield  is disposed within cavity  of lens shield housing  and is configured to rotate within housing  about a rotational axis (represented in  by dashed line ). In the illustrated example, optically-transmissive lens shield  assumes the form of a disc or sheet of a non-opaque material, such as glass or plastic (e.g., Plexiglas®). However, the geometric shape of optically-transmissive lens shield , the dimensions of lens shield , and the material or material from which lens shield  is formed may vary amongst different embodiments.Automated camera cleaning system  is further equipped with a drive motor  having a motor casing  and a rotatable shaft . Motor casing  is conveniently mounted to lens shield housing  adjacent and, perhaps, substantially parallel to camera ; e.g., as indicated in , motor casing  may be mounted to a plurality of mounting pins , which project from a central portion of back wall  of main housing member . In alternative embodiments, motor casing  may be integrally formed with main housing member . When automated camera cleaning system  is assembled, shaft  of motor  connects to a spindle , which extends through a central opening  provided in back wall  of main housing member  to engage a central portion of optically-transmissive lens shield . As a result of this structural arrangement, motor , when energized, will rotate optically-transmissive lens shield  about its rotational axis (again, represented in  by dashed line ) to continually vary the region of lens shield  positioned in optical path . In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, and with reference to the orientation shown in , motor  is configured to rotate optically-transmissive lens shield  in a clockwise direction. Although the speed at which motor  rotates lens shield  during operation of cleaning system  will undoubtedly vary, motor  will typically rotate lens shield  at a relatively slow rotational speed, such as one revolution per minute.At least one wiper blade  is mounted to optically-transmissive lens shield housing  and positioned to sweep across a face of lens shield  as lens shield  rotates relative to lens shield housing . In the illustrated example, specifically, a single wiper blade  is mounted to an inner edge of cover piece  partially defining front aperture  utilizing, for example, a mounting bracket . Wiper blade  is thus positioned within front aperture  to sweep across the front face of optically-transmissive lens shield  (specifically, across an outer annular band of the lens shield) as lens shield  rotates. It will be noted that wiper blade  is positioned outside of optical path  and, therefore, outside of the field-of-view of camera . Thus, as lens shield  is rotated by motor , dust and other debris that has accumulated on the region of lens shield  exposed through front aperture  is moved into contact with and collects against wiper blade . As it collects against wiper blade , the debris moves downward due to gravitational forces and is ultimately ejected from automated camera cleaning system  through a debris chute  provided in main housing member ; e.g., a notch-shaped cut-out formed in annular sidewall , as shown in . As may be most easily appreciated in , wiper blade  may also be angled to move the debris toward debris chute  as the debris aggregates against blade . Movement of aggregated debris toward debris chute  may also be promoted by ram airflow in embodiments wherein automated camera system  is deployed aboard a forward moving vehicle or robot, such as a high speed moving target. Wiper blade , motor , and lens shield  thus cooperate to continually remove debris from optical path  and thereby prevent the accumulation of debris over the lens of camera  without obstructing the field-of-view of camera . Due to the disposition of wiper blade  within front aperture , and the manner in which wiper blade  is partially drawn into cavity  of lens shield housing  during clockwise rotation of lens shield , wiper blade  is largely shielded from direct sun exposure and is consequently less sensitive to drying and cracking than is, for example, the wiper blade of a conventional externally-mounted camera wiper system.Although automated camera cleaning system  is shown in  and is primarily described herein as including a single wiper blade  positioned to remove debris from an outer surface of a given region of optically-transmissive lens shield  immediately after the region rotates through optical path , cleaning system  may include any number of wiper blades assuming other dispositions in further embodiments. For example, in another embodiment, an additional wiper blade can be positioned to sweep across the inner surface of optically-transmissive lens shield  to remove debris or condensation therefrom. Additionally or alternatively, one or more wiper blades can be positioned to sweep across a given region of optically-transmissive lens shield  immediately prior to rotation of the given region into optical path .It is preferred, although by no means necessary, that automated camera cleaning system  further includes at least one cleaning member. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, and with specific reference to , automated camera cleaning system  further includes a front cleaning pad  and a rear cleaning pad . Front cleaning pad  and rear cleaning pad  include a first optical path opening  and a second optical path opening , respectively, which align with front aperture  and rear aperture  when automated camera cleaning system  is assembled to define optical path  and thereby provide camera  with a line-of-sight through housing . Rear cleaning pad  also includes a central opening  through which spindle  extends. As indicated in , cleaning pads  and  may each have a circular geometry and an outer diameter substantially equivalent to the outer diameter of optically-transmissive lens shield ; however, the shape and dimensions of the cleaning pads included within automated camera cleaning system , if any, will vary amongst different embodiments. When automated camera cleaning system  is assembled, optically-transmissive lens shield  resides between front cleaning pad  and rear cleaning pad , which contact the front and rear faces of lens shield , respectively. As lens shield  is rotated about longitudinal axis  () by motor , cleaning pads  and  sweep across the opposing faces of optically-transmissive lens shield  to remove any dust or other debris that was not removed by wiper blade  and/or to polish lens shield . In addition, in embodiments wherein cleaning pads  and  are formed from an absorbent material, such as a felt, wool, or micro-fiber, cleaning pads  and  may remove moisture (e.g., rain, snow, condensation, etc.) from the major faces of lens shield .In embodiments wherein cleaning system  is exposed to freezing temperatures, and considering wind chill in cases wherein cleaning system  is deployed onboard a high speed moving target or other rapidly moving object, automated camera cleaning system  is preferably further equipped with at least one heating element that, when energized, heats optically-transmissive lens shield  to minimize or prevent the formation of ice thereon. For example, as indicated in , automated camera cleaning system  may include a waffle-shaped heating element  disposed adjacent cleaning pad  substantially opposite the leading face of optically-transmissive lens shield . When energized, heating element  heats lens shield  through front cleaning pad  to prevent icing of the leading face of lens shield  exposed to ambient airflow through front aperture . In further embodiments, heating element  or a similar heating element may be embedded within cleaning pad  and/or cleaning pad .The foregoing has thus provided at least one exemplary embodiment of an automated camera cleaning system that continually removes debris deposited over a camera lens, or more specifically over a protective lens shield, without obstructing the camera's field-of-view. The above-described exemplary automated camera cleaning system also minimizes or prevents ice build-up over the camera lens and/or removes water (e.g., rain, snow, condensation, etc.) from over the camera lens. Due to its ruggedized construction and ability operate reliably in relatively harsh operating conditions, the above-described exemplary cleaning system is well-suited for deployment onboard remotely-operated robots and vehicles, such as high speed moving targets. As a still further advantage, the above-described exemplary automated camera cleaning system is highly manufacturable and relatively inexpensive to produce due, at least in part, to its lack of control circuitry and ability to incorporate commercially-available cameras.Although, in the above-described exemplary embodiment, the optically-transmissive lens shield assumed the form of a non-opaque disc configured to rotate in a plane substantially orthogonal to the optical path and the longitudinal axis of a camera, the optically-transmissive lens shield may assume other forms and may be moved in various other manners in further embodiments of the automated camera cleaning system. For example, the optically-transmissive lens shield can assume the form of a ring that circumscribes a camera and that is rotated by a motor about an axis substantially orthogonal to the longitudinal axis of the camera. In further embodiments, the optically-transmissive lens shield may have a spherical, hemispherical, or relatively flat polygonal geometry and may undergo rotational or oscillatory movement during operation of the automated camera cleaning system.While described above in conjunction with a single camera (i.e., camera  shown in ), embodiments of the automated camera cleaning system can easily be adapted for use in conjunction with multiple camera systems (e.g., two or more optical paths can be provided through lens shield housing  shown in ) including stereoscopic camera assemblies. Similarly, alternative embodiments of automated camera cleaning system may include additional structural components other than those explicitly set-forth above. Other components that may usefully be included within alternative embodiments of the automated camera cleaning system include, but are not limited to, environmental seals (e.g., one or more gaskets or O-rings), integrated power supplies (e.g., one or more batteries), and wireless transmitters suitable for transmitting the video data or other optical data provided by the camera associated with the automated camera cleaning system.While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the foregoing Detailed Description, it should be appreciated that a vast number of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention in any way. Rather, the foregoing Detailed Description will provide those skilled in the art with a convenient road map for implementing an exemplary embodiment of the invention. It being understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements described in an exemplary embodiment without departing from the scope of the invention as set-forth in the appended Claims."

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.The invention relates to a toothbrush, having a head and a handle, wherein the head is provided with bristles.Conventional toothbrushes (RU 2032366) have several disadvantages. For one, their hygienic properties are insufficient. In particular, bacteria can multiply unimpedingly in unused toothbrushes. Furthermore, they only perform one function, namely, for dental hygiene.It is the object of the invention to further develop this known toothbrush in such a way that the materials from a toothpaste tube employed for dental hygiene are optimally utilized, while at the same time, contributing to the protection of the environment.The stated object is attained by means of the characteristics of claim .The basic idea of the invention is not only to design the conventional toothbrush to be more hygienic, but to develop it further, so that it also performs additional functions. In accordance with the invention it is designed to remove unused toothpaste from a tube in a better and simpler manner. Improved hygienic properties are achieved because, for example, the bristles are provided with antiseptic materials. In addition to conventional antiseptic materials, silver and other materials are used. A permanent hygienic effect of the silver is assured if the bristles are provided with a thin layer of silver. On its exterior circumference, the head of the toothbrush is provided with elastic massage elements for the gums, which are preferably arranged in parallel. A slit is cut into and through the handle of the toothbrush, wherein its length is equal to the width of a tube of toothpaste whose contents have been mostly squeezed out, and its width is equal to the thickness of a tube of toothpaste whose contents have been mostly squeezed out.The initially emptied portion of the toothpaste tube can be inserted into the slit, and adjusted in such a way that more toothpaste can be squeezed out of the tube of toothpaste. Therefore, the toothpaste contained in the toothpaste tube can, for all practical purposes, be completely squeezed out of the toothpaste tube, so that the empty toothpaste tube can be disposed of without harming the environment.Further advantageous embodiments of the toothbrush are apparent in the dependent claims.It is thus possible to provide for a toothbrush that is further provided with a slit to be cut parallel to the width of the handle, or cut perpendicularly in respect to the width of the handle.The ends of the slit terminate, convexly arched, in the handle, so that no sharp broken edges can be created at these locations when the toothpaste tube is pulled through the slit for squeezing out toothpaste.The areas of the handle which have been weakened because of the slit can be substantially reinforced in that, in the one case, elastic metal elements are embedded in the handle underneath and above the slit or, in the other case, elastic metal elements are embedded next to the slit on both sides of the handle. Here, the elastic metal elements can extend past the length of the slit into the handle, and can preferably be injection-molded into the handle.The head with the bristles can be an exchangeable part connected with the handle containing the slit. Differently designed heads can be connected in this way with the handle, so that only standardized heads with different bristles can be employed. In this way, careful cleaning of the teeth can be performed, good care can be given to the tongue and mouth, and the gums can be massaged.The invention will be explained in greater detail by means of an exemplary embodiment represented in the drawings.The invention relates to a toothbrush, having a head and a handle, wherein the head is provided with bristles. So that the toothbrush can be used for squeezing toothpaste out of a squeezed- together toothpaste tube, the invention provides that a slit is cut into the handle, and is matched in its length to the width of a squeezed-out toothpaste tube, and in its width to the thickness of a squeezed-out toothpaste tube.So that no sharp broken edges are created at the ends of the slit, there is a concavely arched transition into the handle at the ends of the slit. Furthermore, elastic metal elements are embedded in the handle underneath and above the slit, and extend past the ends of the slit into the handle, and are embedded into the handle. Also, elastic metal elements reinforce the handle in the area of the slit, so that the weakened parts of the handle in the area of the slit can provide a considerably stronger pressure force to a toothpaste tube introduced into the slit.. Toothbrush headThe toothbrush has a head  with bristles  inserted into it. The head  is connected in one piece with a handle , having a slit  cut into it. The head  with the bristles  and the handle  with the slit  can also be embodied as separate pieces and can be connected with each other, for example, by means of a screw connection. This separation makes it possible to selectively connect differently designed heads  with bristles  to the same handle  having a slit , in order to expand the range of application and use of the toothbrush.As represented in the exemplary embodiment in accordance with , the slit  in the handle  can be cut in parallel in respect to the broad sides of the handle . In this case, the slit  is of a length that corresponds to the width of a squeezed-out toothpaste tube, and a width that corresponds to the thickness of a squeezed-out toothpaste tube. The slit  can also be cut into the handle  perpendicularly in respect to the broad sides of the handle .So that no sharp broken edges are created at the ends of the slit , there is a concavely arched transition into the handle  at the ends of the slit . As  further shows, elastic metal elements ,  are embedded in the handle  underneath and above the slit , and extend past the ends of the slit  into the handle  and are embedded into the handle . Embedding into the handle  preferably takes place by means of an injection-molding process into the plastic of which the handle  and the head  are made.Elastic metal elements  and  reinforce the handle  in the area of the slit , so that the weakened parts of the handle  in the area of the slit  can provide a considerably stronger pressure force to a toothpaste tube introduced into the slit .In the view of the above, on the broad side of the handle  in accordance with , the slit can also be cut perpendicularly in respect to the broad sides of the handle . Elastic metal elements ,  are then embedded, or respectively injection-molded, in the handle  at both sides of the slit ."

                "This invention relates to the cleaning of stainless steel and other metals subsequent to welding operations. For the sake of convenience, the invention will be described in relation to welded stainless steel surfaces but it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto as it may be applied to other welded surfaces.In the course of welding stainless steel surfaces, chromium is depleted and thereby exposing iron causing localised discolouration which must be removed to restore the polished appearance to the stainless steel. Metallic oxides in the form of scale can also form on the surface during the welding process and these need to be cleaned away or otherwise removed.Surface staining and weld scale on stainless steel parts can be removed using a pickling gel of toxic acids including hydrofluoric and nitric acids. This prior art method requires a significant amount of time and occupational health and safety risks result.It is also known to use electrically activated stainless steel weld cleaning devices which utilise a non-conductive fabric sock that covers a solid or wire electrode. The sock acts as a separator between the electrode and the work piece as well as a reservoir for the acidic electrolyte cleaning solution.The sock is saturated with the cleaning solution which provides a short electrically conductive path between the electrode and the work piece. The cleaning solution is heated by the passage of electrical current through it and becomes more chemically active thereby cleaning the metal surface.One disadvantage with these prior art devices is that the fabric socks tend to dry out and then burn through with the heat of the process. Another disadvantage is that the electrode is essentially a rigid shape which cannot conform to the many odd shapes encountered in stainless steel fabricated constructions.Another approach is to use a conductive brush which consists of a conductive receptacle from which extends a bundle of conductive filaments or fibres. However, such conductive brushes perform poorly as a brush bristle because the fibres tend to flop on their sides—particularly when wet with electrolyte—rather than presenting erect fibre ends as the working contact point.Electricity travels along the shortest path so that the electric current will flow through the side of a fibre part way along its length where the fibre comes in contact with the metal surface being cleaned. This causes two problems—one is that the heat caused by the flow of electrical current through the side wall of the fibre tends to cut the fibre at the contact point. The second problem is that whereas this flow of electric current performs the desired effect of heating the immersion electrolyte thereby cleaning the metal surface, accurate control of the cleaning process is reduced due to the broad spread of the fibres. When working in corners, the electric current passes to the nearest contact point and thus the current reaching the full depth of the corner is significantly reduced. It is therefore difficult to clean properly two faced corners with three faced corners being even more difficult.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a conductive weld brush comprising a conductive receptacle having a first end and a second end, a bundle of conductive fibres anchored by one end to the first end of the receptacle with the remainder of the bundle extending from the receptacle and a slidable support sleeve having an inner end slidable along the receptacle, the sleeve having a shaped outer end portion movable along the bundle of fibres.The conductive weld brush  shown in the drawings includes a conductive receptacle  and a bundle of conductive fibres  which are anchored by their inner end within the conductive receptacle . As can be seen in , the conductive receptacle  is of flattened configuration and has a connection  at the non-fibre end which is connected to conductor  within a wand . A tip insulator  surrounds the connection , the end portion  of the brush  and the socket  of the wand . An insulator  surrounds the wand  and its inner end is located within the tip insulator .The conductive brush  also includes a slidable support sleeve  which has a first end portion  which receives the conductive receptacle  and a shaped second end portion  which surrounds and shapes the fibre bundle . The support sleeve  has acid entry holes  so that the brush  may be dipped to apply the acid and the end of the fibre containing portion  may be profiled to suit any particular application.As will be apparent from the foregoing description, the fibre bundle can be held in the desired shape whilst cleaning is being performed. This is made possible by the slidable support sleeve which can be variously shaped at its outer end and whose cross section fits neatly over the fibre bundle in a manner that allows it to be adjusted along the fibre length as the fibres deteriorate in use.The conductive brush of the invention has improved performance which is achieved through the concentration of the energy transfer and by presenting the fibre ends to the metal surface and improved electric arc process between the fibre ends and the metal surface serve to help break up tough metal oxides that can form on some welds.The preferred shape of the receptacle  is a round-ended rectangle which gives a flat brush of uniform sectional thickness.The slidable support sleeve can be formed from any one of the variety of materials such as teflon, ceramic, or metal. The support sleeve  is shaped at one end to slidingly fit over the fibre brush bundle  and the receptacle  with some clearance for a portion of the sleeve's length. The rest of the sleeve is formed to be a sliding fit over the brush insulator for whatever cross sectional shape the brush insulator takes for a particular design.In a modification of the invention, the cleaning liquid could be introduced through the wand stem  into the interior of the receptacle .The conductive weld brush of the invention has application to the cleaning of welded stainless steel and other metal surfaces."

                "This is a continuation of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/461,357, filed Apr. 8, 2003.The present invention is directed to a new and improved tool or implement holder, such as for a razor, employing a semi-rigid or flexible tube containing a composition, such as shaving cream, that works in association with the tool or implement, such as a razor blade attachment at the end of the tube which can receive and detachably secure a razor blade. The body of the tube serves as a handle for the tool or implement.There are many implements or tools used today that are used in association with a composition; and there are many compositions in use today that require or are preferably used with a tool or implement. For example, depilatories are normally used in conjunction with a scraper. Depilatory composition is applied to the area of interest, the depilatory composition is allowed to set for a set period of time, and then the composition, together with the depilated hair, is removed employing a scraper. Similarly, compositions used to clean spots off of clothes or off fabrics or from rugs are applied to the soiled area, allowed to work in the soiled area to perform their action, and frequently the composition is worked into or rubbed in, or rubbed with a brush before removal to enhance cleaning. Grouting compositions that are used to grout cracks or holes in surfaces, such as walls or ceilings, are applied to fill the crack or hole and then a blade is applied to smooth the grout so that it is even with the surface surrounding the hole or crack. Massage lotions are applied to the skin and then the massaging implement is worked over the skin with the lotion acting as a lubricant as well as performing other functions depending upon the composition of the lotion. Compositions are available for removing paint from surfaces, such as mirrors and windows. Compositions are available to soften materials to remove labels, and the like. The softening composition is applied to the surface of the material or to the label to act upon it, the composition is allowed to work on the material for a period of time, and then it is scraped off employing a planar scraper blade which can have a knife-edge or blunt edge with sharp 90-degree corners.Paint, ink, coatings, waxes, and protective coatings are applied to an area frequently using a sponge. Some paint removers and polishers are applied to a surface and then after they have acted upon the surface, they are rubbed with sandpaper or a very fine polishing surface to either remove the paint or coating or to polish the surface.Razors have traditionally comprised a frame with a fixed razor blade or a razor blade holder which is used to removably secure razor blades. Razors have been in use for over a century. The handle is normally elongated and shaped somewhat like a toothbrush handle. The head of the razors for replaceable razor blades is adapted to receive the particular type of razor blade that it is designed for. Although there are razor blades that can be received on a universal head, many razor blades can only be received on a proprietary head.Shaving lotions come in cans, flexible tubes, semi-rigid tubes and in soap cakes. Shaving lather is normally applied to the skin when the skin is wetted. Preferably the skin has been prewashed to remove facial oils and bacteria. Earliest shaving lathers were lathered up from soft caked soap placed in the bottom of a mug, wetted with water and then lathered up with a brush. The brush applied the lather to the face. Shaving lather caked soap is still available. In the 1930's, prepared lather creams started to appear. These lather creams were sold in flexible tubes, tubes similar to toothpaste tubes. The tubes were originally made from tin or lead or alloys thereof. Later tubes were made of aluminum. Today the tubes are made from plastic. Some lather creams were meant to be applied to a wet face directly with the hands or fingers. Other lather creams were made to be applied with a brush. These types of shaving lather creams are still available. In the 1960's, shaving foams became available in pressurized cans wherein the lather foam was released from the can by pressing the relief valve. The lather foam was released as a foaming mass which was applied to the face typically with the fingers and hands. This is the most common form of shaving lather used today.With regard to volume and size, the cake soap shaving lather requires less room, but it also requires a container, such as a mug, and a brush to utilize. Volumetrically, the shaving lathers that are available in aerosol cans require the most space and can be applied with the hands and fingers making them easy to use. Shaving lather creams available in tubes are easy to apply with the hands and fingers and require less than half the space of shaving lathers supplied in aerosol cans and work equally as well. They do not require a mug or brush.Many women prefer to shave body hair in the bathtub or in the shower, and many men prefer to shave their beards in the shower. The bath and shower are not convenient for the use of the cake soap shaving lather with mug and brush. If the mug is dropped, it can break since they are normally made of ceramic material showering sharp particles. In addition, the mug can chip the bathtub or shower tile The aerosol can has a disadvantage that if it is kept in the shower or around the tub, it gets wet and the metal of the aerosol rust causing rust stains in tile grout and the like. In addition, if the can is dropped, it can chip the bathtub or shower tile. Thus, when shaving in the bathtub or in the shower, shaving lather cream that is contained within a flexible tube is preferred because a flexible tube is normally nonmetallic and can be dropped without breakage or chipping and can be left in or around the tub or shower without causing rust stains. The flexible tube of shaving cream is more convenient for travel because it requires less space than aerosol cans and does not require the use of a mug or brush for application.One of the problems that is encountered by people when traveling is the amount of space required for their shaving gear including the razor blade with its frame and the shaving lather source, whether it is soap cake shaving lather applied with a brush or shaving lather applied from a flexible tube or shaving lather applied from an aerosol can. Another problem is that when people shave around the bathtub or shower, the separate components, the razor blade with handle and the source of the shaving cream, take up space which is normally in a premium around a bathtub or in a shower stall.Thus, there is a need and there has been a need for a single unit shaving device which contains the shaving lather as well as functioning as a frame, support and handle for the razor blade.Many compositions, such as shaving cream, cleaning preparations, and the like, are thick or gelatinous materials that cannot easily be removed from a rigid bottle. These compositions are more easily applied from a flexible container having flexible or semi-rigid walls, such as a toothpaste tube.Many compositions are supplied in flexible tubes with a separate tool or implement for use. The tube and tool or implement frequently get separated, and thus when the user wants to use the composition, they cannot find the implement or tool or vice versa. In addition, because of the relatively low cost for many compositions, tools are made cheaply and skimpily and do not have an adequate handle. It is an object of the present invention to provide a flexible tube having flexible or semi-rigid walls for dispensing a composition for use and the implement or tools being secured to the flexible tube so that the implement or tool cannot be separated from the composition and the flexible tube can function as a large handle so that the implement or tool can be comfortably held and worked.The present invention is directed to an improved razor for supporting and holding a razor blade and containing the shaving lather. The present invention comprises a semi-rigid flexible tube, such as the tubes disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,871,020 and 6,053,184, which has secured to the end thereof a razor blade attachment unit. The razor blade attachment unit can have a razor blade attachment plate of the universal type which can receive and detachably secure many of the razor blades produced by a number of companies or it can be an attachment unit that has been designed specifically for a particular razor blade. There are several proprietary razor blades that are produced which can only be received by a particular type or proprietary razor blade attachment assembly.The present invention is also directed to a tool holder for a flexible tube comprising a frame adapted to be secured to the sealed end of the flexible tube, the frame having an attachment portion and a tool portion, the attachment portion having a first surface adapted to generally mate with the portion of the sealed end of the flexible tube, the tool portion having a tool holder adapted to receive a tool. The first surface can be adapted to be affixed to the sealed end of the tube by sonic or heating welding, or by adhesion, or by a friction fit. The tube holder can have at least one bore extending through the frame of the tool holder which is in registration with a bore through the sealed end. In one embodiment, a fastener, such as a rivet, is passed and secured through one or more bores of the frame and through bores in registration of the sealed end to secure the tool holder to the sealed end of the tube. In one embodiment of the invention, a tool holder is adapted to permanently receive a tool. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, a tool holder is adapted to removably receive a tool so the tool can be attached for use and removed. A tool can be a razor blade cartridge which is received on the tool holder. A tool can be a brush which is affixed to the tool holder. A tool holder can be a cosmetic scraper which is roughly right angles to the main plane of the tool holder and the longitudinal axis of the flexible tube. The tool holder can be a stiff planar blade scraper extending roughly out in the main plane of the tool holder and parallel to or intersecting the longitudinal axis of the flexible tube. The scraper has a knife-edge or blunt edge with sharp corners. The tool holder can be a flexible planar blade extending roughly out in the main plane of the tool holder and parallel to or intersecting the longitudinal axis of the flexible tube and adapted to apply and smooth grouting. The tool can be a massager head affixed to the tool holder having a surface with protrusion extending therefrom for massaging tissue. The tool can be a brush or sponge affixed to the tool to spread, or smooth, or coat a surface with paint, ink, coatings, waxes, polishes, protective coatings, and the like to a surface. The tool can be a curved or planar support plate adapted to receive sandpaper which can be secured by an adhesive, or to a polishing pad comprising a soft fabric-like material which can be secured by an adhesive.When the tool is a sponge, massager head, sandpaper device or polishing device with a polishing pad, the working surface of the brush, sponge, massager head, sandpaper and polishing pad are angled from the main plane of the tool holder and the longitudinal axis of the flexible tube normally about 45 degrees plus/minus 15 degrees. However, the working surface can be angled up to 90 degrees from the main plane of the tool holder and the longitudinal axis of the flexible tube. The longitudinal axis of the flexible tube is parallel to or lies in the main plane of the tool holder.The alternative embodiment of the present invention comprises an implement holder and a flexible tube handle, the flexible handle comprising a flexible tube having semi-rigid or flexible walls. The tube holder comprises a frame adapted to be secured to the sealed end of the flexible tube, the frame having an attachment portion and a tool portion, the attachment portion having a first surface adapted to generally mate with a portion of the sealed end of the flexible tube, the tool portion having a tube holder adapted to receive a tool or having a tool affixed thereto. In one embodiment, the first surface is affixed to the sealed end of the flexible tube. In another embodiment, the frame of the tool holder is secured to the flexible tube by a fastener[s], such as a rivet[s]. The tool portion can be a razor blade cartridge, it can be a brush, it can be a stiff planar blade scraper, it can be a cosmetic scraper, it can be a flexible planar blade grouter, it can be massager head, it can be a support plate with a planar or curved surface adapted to hold sandpaper, emery cloth, or a polishing pad, and the like. The flexible tube is adapted to receive a composition to be used in association with the tool and is dispensed from the flexible tube from the applicator end opposite the sealed end.In one embodiment of the present invention, the invention is a shaver comprising a tool holder for a flexible tube adapted to contain shaving cream used in connection with the shaver. In another embodiment of the present invention, the invention is a cleaning device comprising a tool holder for a cleaning implement, such as a brush, and a flexible tube adapted to receive cleaning compositions which are used in connection with the cleaning implement. In another embodiment of the present invention, the invention is a scraping device comprising a tool holder for a scraper, and a flexible tube adapted to contain compositions for removal or softening of materials from surfaces used in conjunction with the scraper device. The compositions for removal of materials from surfaces can be paint removers, softening compositions for removing adhesive materials, hydrocarbon or halogenated compositions for removal of tar, oil and greases from surfaces, and the like.In another embodiment of the present invention, the invention is directed to a caulking device comprising a tool holder for a caulking blade, and a flexible tube adapted to contain caulking composition used in connection with the caulking blade. The caulking blade is normally a flexible planar blade used for applying caulking to cracks and holes and for smoothing the caulking so that the surface of the caulking material is contiguous with the surface surrounding the crack or hole.In another embodiment of the invention, the invention is directed to a cosmetic scraper comprising a tool holder for a cosmetic scraper, and a flexible tube adapted to contain depilatory compositions for the removal of hair from skin, which is used in connection with the cosmetic scraper.In another embodiment of the invention, the invention is directed to a massager comprising a tool holder for a flexible tube adapted to contain massage lotions used in connection with the massager.In another embodiment of the invention, the invention is directed to a device comprising a tool holder for a flexible tube adapted to contain paint, ink, coatings, waxes, polishes, protective coatings and other coatings used in connection with a sponge secured to the tool. The sponge can be secured to the tool holder with an adhesive backing so that the sponge can be replaced with fresh sponges as the need arises.In still another embodiment of the present invention, the invention is directed to a device comprising a tool holder for a flexible tube and adapted to contain paint remover or polish used in conjunction with sandpaper or a polisher pad secured to the tool holder. Preferably, the sandpaper or polishing pad is secured to the tool holder with self-adhesive backing so that the sandpaper or polishing pad can be removed and replaced as the need arises.Referring to , the razor blade attachment unit  comprises a frame  having an arm  extending upwardly and outwardly therefrom and a razor blade attachment plate  secured to the end of the arm . Alternatively, a proprietary razor blade attachment assembly can be used (not shown). The razor blade attachment plate  can be a universal attachment plate which will receive most razor blades manufactured today. However, some razor blades cannot be secured by the universal attachment plate and the proprietary attachment assembly must be used for the attachment of such blades if they are to be used.The frame  has a ribbed front side  and a planar back side . A hole  extends through the frame from the ribbed front side to the planar back side adapted to receive a hanger to support the razor or a fastener, such as a rivet, to secure the frame to the sealed end or flexible tube. The ribbed front side  has a pair of U-shaped ribs R and L on the right side and left side, respectively, of the frame that extend downwardly from the outer ends of the arm to the bottom of the frame where they curve in a U-shaped manner and extend upwardly again where they join to form a platform  which is connected to the arm . The frame  has a planar wall  which is recessed with respect to the front of the U-shaped ribs. The back side of the planar wall  defines the planar back side . On the planar back side  at the base  of the frame , the surface of the back side is cut inwardly to form an arcuate scalloped wall portion . This portion is scalloped to receive the bulging wall of the shaving cream semi-rigid tube. The use of the ribs in conjunction with the planar wall provides a frame that is strong and light weight and minimizes the use of materials and is yet rigid enough to perform the desired function.To both reinforce the razor blade attachment unit  and to add a decorative feature to the unit, portions of the U-shaped ribs are stiffened and reinforced with respect to each other by the platform  and with a series of arcuate ribs A through D. At the base of the frame , a base rib  extends from the base of the U-shaped ribs to further stiffen and reinforce the unit. The frame  is relatively rigid or stiff because of the planar wall , the U-shaped ribs R and L, and arcuate ribs A through D, and the base rib . The arm , being a curved sheet-like structure has a limited degree of flexibility to assist the attached razor blade (see ) to follow the contour of the skin during shaving.Referring to , the razor blade of the present invention comprises the razor blade attachment unit  and the semi-rigid tube . The flexible or semi-rigid tube  conveniently contains shaving cream which can be forced out of the flexible tube through the applicator head . The shaving cream can be applied to the face employing the applicator head. This eliminates the need to use the hands or fingers for application of the shaving cream. The applicator heads are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,871,020 and 6,053,184, the disclosures for which are incorporated herein by reference. The invention is not limited to flexible tubes having applicator heads. Flexible tubes with conventional heads, such as seen on toothpaste tubes, shaving cream tubes, etc., can be used. The end of the flexible or semi-rigid tube  is sealed to form an end seal . The end seal can be arcuate as seen in  and adapted to mate with arcuate scallop wall portion  of razor blade attachment unit . However, the end seal can also be nonarcuate, that is straight, as seen in . This is adapted to mate with a nonarcuate or straight scallop wall portion A seen in , , , , , , , , , , , and . The end seal is conveniently sealed by sonic welding although heat welding, plasma welding or suitable adhesives can also be used. The planar back side  of the razor attachment unit  is secured to the end seal  of the semi-rigid tube  in the attachment area  (shown in cross hatching in ) by sonic welding, heat welding, plasma welding an adhesive, or by a rivet passing through the hole  and a hole  in registration with hole . Sonic welding has been found to be quite satisfactory. The bulge of the flexible tube adjacent to the seal end  is accommodated in the scallop wall portion  (A in ) of the razor blade attachment unit  which permits the planar back side  of the razor blade attachment unit  to be somewhat in plane or somewhat parallel with the longitudinal axis of the semi-rigid tube . This positions the razor blade attachment plate  and the razor blade received therein correctly with respect to the semi-rigid tube handle . The angle A is preferably about 25°±5°. Although the scallop wall portion can be secured to the outer wall of the flexible tube, it has not been found necessary by the applicant and such attachment is optional. The hole  extends through the razor blade attachment unit  as described above and through the hole  in the head portion  and the end seal . This hole can be utilized for hanging the razor  on hooks in retail establishments for display and presentation for purchase, or it can receive a rivet or other securing attachment to secure the unit  to the flexible tube .Although it is anticipated that the unit will be sold with a razor blade attached, the razor can be sold and transported or stored without a razor blade secured to the razor blade attachment plate . When the razor is to be utilized, a razor blade  can be slide on to the plate  in the conventional manner. The plate can be designed to detachably lock and secure the razor blade  on to the plate. When an operator wishes to replace the razor blade, take the razor blade out for any reason, the razor blade  can be slid off the plate . The attachment plate  can also be designed to permanently receive a razor blade which would prevent removal of the razor blade from the plate . In the razor blade illustrated in , the razor blade has three blades . Some razor blades have a single blade, others have two or more blades, and they can also be utilized on the present razor .Referring to , another embodiment of the razor of the present invention is illustrated. The elements of this embodiment, which are identical to the elements of the razor shown in , have the same drawing numbering. The razor attachment E has a front wall  extending from the frame B and a slot  is formed between the back wall  and the front wall . The slot  is adapted to securely receive the sealed end  of the flexible tube  in a friction fit or pinch fit. The walls of the slot  can have protrusions or teeth (not shown) to firmly grip the sealed end  to prevent the razor attachment unit  from being removed from the flexible tube . Additionally, the razor attachment unit can be secured to the sealed end by sonic welding, heat welding, plasma welding, or adhesive between the walls of the slot and the sealed end, or by a rivet passing through the hole  and a hole  in the sealed end which is in registration with hole .Referring to , another alternative embodiment of the razor attachment unit A is illustrated. The elements of the razor attachment unit A which are identical to the elements of razor attachment unit  are shown with the same drawing numbers. The principal difference between the razor attachment unit A from that of razor attachment unit  is the addition of the extended braces or supports  which extend down from the front of the frame A to provide further support of the razor attachment unit with respect to the flexible tube  (see ). When force is applied to the razor attachment , such as during shaving, the attachment between unit  and the sealed end  acts as a pivot point and the arm between the point of attachment and the razor attachment head  acts as a fulcrum or lever arm which forces the bottom portion of the frame  against the side of the flexible or semi-rigid tube  which could collapse the side of the tube which could render the tube's effectiveness as a tool handle. The braces or support  of the razor attachment unit   increases the surface area of the bottom portion of the frame A and braces the frame and resists pivoting of the frame at the point of attachment of the frame and the sealed end, and forcing the bottom of the frame into the side of the tube.The flexible tubes  are made of plastic such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The flexible tubes can be co-extruded tubes which are multilayered tubes made of plastic and/or meal. These tubes can be made in a variety of flexibilities from being very flexible to being semi-rigid. In fact, they can be made quite rigid. But rigid wall tubes are undesirable because they can make it difficult, if not impossible, to dispense the contents therein, especially for thick compositions. Thus, it is anticipated that the attachment will be used on either flexible or semi-rigid tubes. For flexible wall tubes, the movement or pivoting of the razor attachment unit with respect to the sealed end is a minor problem when the tube is filled with content. However, when a third or more of the contents have been evacuated from the tube, the razor attachment unit with sufficient force can partially or fully collapse the side of the tube as the unit pivots at the point of attachment as the razor is used. The razor attachment unit A has less of a tendency to pivot and collapse the side of the tube than the razor attachment unit  when used on a partially filled flexible tube.Referring to , the attachment unit can be designed for a variety of purposes. The unit shown in  is a cosmetic scraper attachment unit used for scraping surfaces. The scraper head A will be integral with the scraper attachment unit B. The scraper head A can have a blunt edge or a knife-edge edge or an edge in between. The components or elements of scraper attachment unit B, which are identical to the same elements in razor attachment unit , are identified with the same drawing numbers. The scraper head A can be utilized for a number of applications. It is contemplated using the scraper attachment unit B with a tube  containing a depilatory agent for removal of hair from the body. The depilatory agent will be applied to the surface of the skin which bears the unwanted hair, allowed to work depilate the hair and then the composition and the depilated hair will be removed by employing the scraper to scrape off the composition and the depilated hair. After the operation is complete, hair and composition adhering to the scraper head A can be easily removed with water to leave a clean scraper attachment unit. The resiliency of the neck A can be adjusted either in thickness and/or in the composition used to manufacture the scraper attachment unit so that the semi-rigid neck that has sufficient resiliency so that the scraper head rides over imperfections on the surface of the skin.Referring to , a planar blade attachment unit C is illustrated. The elements of the blade attachment unit C and the razor attachment unit , which are identical, have been identified by the same drawing numbers. With proper design and manufacture, the blade attachment unit C can be utilized as a scraper or a grouting blade . When the blade C is to be utilized as a grouting blade, the blade  will be relatively pliable or flexible and normally will have a blunt squared-off edge . When blade C is a grouting blade, it can be utilized to apply grout or filler from the flexible tube to cracks, holes and the like. When the blade C is to be utilized as a scraper, such as a scraper to remove paint or other materials, blade  will be relatively rigid and the edge  will be a sharp edge, like a knife-edge, or a squared-off edge  with sharp edges and corners. When blade attachment unit C is a grouting blade, the grout will be stored within the flexible tube. In use, the grouting material will be dispensed from the tube into the crack or hole and the grouting material will be forced into the crack or hole and smoothed with respect to the surface surrounding the crack or hole employing the grouting blade . When the blade attachment unit C is a scraper, the flexible tube will contain composition used to soften, lift or remove material, such as paint, label adhesive, tar, and the like. The composition will be dispensed from the tube onto the material that is to be softened or removed. The composition is given sufficient time to work on the material, then the material is scraped off employing the scraper blade . The scrapers are illustrated with working ends perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the blade. The working edge can be angled A (in phantom ) to the longitudinal axis of the blade.Referring to , a brush attachment unit B is illustrated. The elements of the brush attachment unit B, which are common with the razor attachment unit , are identified by the same figure numbers. The brush attachment unit B has a bristle support plate  on which bristles  are supported. The bristles support plate  is connected to the frame C by the rigid neck C. The bristles can be molded into or with the bristle support plate at the same time the brush attachment unit frame is molded, or they can be added later. The bristles can be plastic, fiber, metal, or the like. In one embodiment, the bristles and bristles support plate  are manufactured separately and secured to the neck C by sonic welding, heat welding, adhesive, or the like. The bristles can be stiff or they can be flexible, depending upon the intended use of the brush attachment unit. One use is for cleaning wherein the tube  contains a cleaning composition which is dispensed onto the area to be cleaned and the cleaning composition is worked into the area that is to be cleaned, such as a spot on a fabric or rug, to remove a spot. A brush attachment unit can also be employed to coat a surface with composition contained in the tube, such as a protective coating, paint, ink, and the like.Referring to , a sandpaper/polishing pad attachment unit G is illustrated. The elements of the sandpaper/polishing attachment unit G which are common with the razor attachment unit , are identified by the same drawing or figure numbers. The sandpaper/polishing pad attachment unit G has a support plate A which supports the sandpaper or polishing pad. The sandpaper or polishing pad can be secured permanently to the support plate F, or they can be attached by an adhesive layer on the back of the sandpaper or pad. In that event, the sandpaper or polishing pad can be removed from the support plate and replaced with a fresh sandpaper or polishing pad when the need arises. Sandpaper comes in many grades, such as a very rough grade 10 and a very fine grade 1200. For the removal of paint or the like, a very rough grade is utilized. For a very fine finish, a very fine paper is used, such as the 1200 grade. The polishing pad can be a natural fiber pad such as a cotton or wool pad, a synthetic fiber pad such as a polyester or nylon pad, or it can be a smooth fiber-reinforced paper pad, or the like. The support plate F is connected to the frame D by the rigid neck D. The support plate can have a planar surface or a curved surface (not shown) and it can be rigid or resilient or flexible. In one embodiment, the support plate A can be manufactured separately and secured to the neck D by sonic welding, heat welding, adhesive, or the like.Referring to , a massage attachment unit H is illustrated. The elements of the massage attachment unit H, which are common with the razor attachment unit , are identified by the same figure numbers. Massage attachment unit H has a support plate F on which a massage head H is attached. Massage head H has a plurality of protrusions  for massaging tissue, especially the skin. Protrusions  come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Protrusions can be teeth-like with blunt heads and the teeth can be relatively flexible or inflexible (not shown), the protrusions can be elongated thick bristle-like structures (not shown), protrusions  can be half-round protrusions as illustrated in , and the like. The support plate F is connected to the frame D by the rigid neck D. The massage head H normally is made of an elastomeric relatively soft material. The support plate can have a rectangular footprint as shown, or a round, square, oval, and the like, footprint. The support plate can have a planar surface or a curved surface (not shown) and it can be rigid or resilient or flexible. The massaging head H can be molded at the same time the massaging attachment unit frame is molded, or it can be molded with the support plate F as a separate unit distinct from the frame D, or it can be added later to the support plate  with adhesive. In the latter case, the massage head can be permanently attached to the support plate, or it can be removably secured to the support plate with a non-hardening adhesive coating on the back of the massage head. In that case, the massage head can be removed and replaced with another massage head as the need arises, such as to change the shape of the massage head for a different type of massaging action.Referring to , a universal implement attachment unit  for flexible tubes is illustrated. The elements of the attachment unit , which are identical to the elements of the razor attachment unit , are illustrated with the same drawing numbers. The attachment unit  has a top portion  with a female receptacle  which is adapted to receive the male extension  of the implement . The female receptacle  receive the male extension  either in a permanent locked position or in a removable secured position depending upon the intent of the user. The tool can be any of the implements shown in the preceding figures, including a razor attachment, a scraper, a blade, a brush, massager, a sponge applicator, a sandpaper/polishing pad, and the like. The tool can be received by the attachment unit  by securing the male extension  of the tool implement  into the female receptacle  of the attachment unit . The working end of the implement can be a razor attachment, a blade, a cosmetic scraper, a brush, massager, sandpaper/polishing pad, and the like.As discussed above, the razor blade attachment plate is offset 25 degrees plus/minus 5 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the flexible tube (). The cosmetic scraper is offset 30-90 degrees with respect to the main plane MP of the attachment unit and/or the longitudinal axis LA of the flexible tube. The sealed end of the tube is planar and lies in or is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the flexible tube. The planar backside  of the frame  is normally parallel to or intersected by the longitudinal axis of the flexible tube since the planar backside is secured to the sealed end. The planar scraper blade and the planar grouting blade  are roughly parallel with respect to the main plane MP of the attachment unit C and/or intersects or is parallel to the longitudinal axis LA of the flexible tube. Although the planar blade tool is normally planar with respect to the longitudinal axis of the flexible tube, the blade can be offset from the longitudinal axis LA, such as angled out 45 degrees if so desired. The support plates for the attachment units D, F, G, and H are normally offset around 45 degrees plus/minus 15 degrees from the main plane MP and/or longitudinal axis LA. That is, a perpendicular axis PA passing through the support plate (see ) is 45 degrees to the longitudinal axis LA of the flexible tube and/or the main plane MP of the frame plus/minus 15 degrees. However, the support plate can be perpendicular to the longitudinal axis LA of the flexible tube or the main plane MP of the frame depending upon the tool and how it is most effectively used.As discussed above, the attachment units can be fixed to, or secured to, the sealed end of the flexible tube with welding (heat or sonic) forming a weldment boundary between the sealed end and the attachment unit, or with an adhesive or cement capable of bonding the attachment unit to the sealed end forming an adhesive or bonding film or layer between the sealed end and the attachment unit, or by a fastener[s] such as a rivet.The invention has been described with specific embodiments but the spirit and intent of the invention is not limited to such specific embodiments. The specific embodiments have been used to illustrate some examples of the present invention but are intended to be limitations of the scope of the present invention."

                "The invention relates to a connecting device for a wiper arm as well as a flat bar wiper blade.Already known from DE-A-102 30 457 is a connecting device for a wiper arm and a wiper blade, which has a first connecting part on the wiper blade side and a second connecting part on the wiper arm side, which are juxtaposed in the operational position. The second connecting part has a hinge element so that the wiper blade is connected to the wiper arm so that it can swivel around a hinge axis, wherein a securing means is provided so that the two connecting parts engage with one another.In addition, numerous devices for connecting wiper arms to wiper blades are known in which the connecting part on the wiper arm side is arranged above the connecting part on the wiper blade side.What is problematic with these types of connecting devices, however, is that they have an unfavorable flow profile and due to their structural height are subject to high wind resistance from the air stream wind of the motor vehicle. In addition, despite the flat design a pleasing outward appearance must be guaranteed.The advantage of the connecting device in accordance with the invention is that the first connecting part has a receptacle for accommodating the securing means, in which a longitudinal shaped portion, particularly a groove, is provided which is parallel to the hinge axis. Improved flow behavior is achieved in this way and a low structural height of the connecting device or of the wiper arm with the wiper blade is also achieved.In a simple and cost-effective embodiment, the securing means is comprised of a bridge with a limit. This guarantees that the wiper blade cannot detach from the wiper arm when in operation.It is especially advantageous in this case if the securing means at least partially overlaps the first connecting part and the limit is arranged such that, in the operational position, the first connecting part and the second connecting part are locked against axial displacement on the hinge axis.Simple handling is achieved in a cost-effective manner in that the first connecting part can be detached from and/or connected to the second connecting part by one rotation of one of the connecting parts around the hinge element by at least a detachment angle. In this way, it is possible to separate the wiper blade from the wiper arm or to connect it without the assistance of tools and without special knowledge thereby simplifying assembly particularly for the layman.In addition, it is advantageous if the limit has a shoulder for determining the detachment angle.Moreover, it is advantageous if the detachment angle is between 5 and 50°, particularly between 20 and 40°, preferably between 20 and 30°, ideally approx. 25°, because this guarantees a secure hold of the connecting device without impeding handling when replacing the wiper blade.In this case it is particularly advantageous if a limit stop is provided, which is formed in particular by an edge or surface of the receptacle, which prevents rotation beyond the detachment angle. In particular, this further simplifies replacing the wiper blade.Ideally, the longitudinal shaped portion is dimensioned in such a way that it is able to accommodate the shoulder when detaching and/or connecting the connecting parts.In a simple embodiment, the receptacle is advantageously embodied to be groove-shaped and is comprised of in particular two side walls and a base, which in particular is essentially embodied to be flat. This is simple to manufacture in an injection molding process and extremely cost-effective as a result.In this connection, it is particularly advantageous if the shaped portion is arranged on the base, in particular in the area of one of the side walls.Furthermore, it is advantageous if the first connecting part has a spoiler wall, which forms the entire height of the first connecting part and terminates one spoiler side. This produces an outward appearance that is especially favorable in terms of flow and also achieves an especially pleasing visual appearance.The securing means terminates essentially flush with the first connecting part in an especially simple, cost-effective and pleasing manner.A flat bar wiper blade in accordance with the invention with a first connecting part for fastening the flat bar wiper blade to a wiper arm, which is comprised of a counter-hinge element so that the flat bar wiper blade can be connected to the wiper arm so that it can be swiveled around a hinge axis, in which a groove-shaped receptacle for accommodating a securing means is provided, in which a longitudinal shaped portion, particularly a groove, is provided which is parallel to the hinge axis, features especially good flow behavior so that the wiper blade is guided securely on the window even at high wind speeds. In addition, this renders possible a connection to a wiper arm that is secure, reliable and simple to operate.In this case, it is advantageous if a spoiler is provided and the first connecting part has a spoiler wall, which essentially accommodates the spoiler in its cross section and terminates the first connecting part on the spoiler side. This further improves the flow behavior of the flat bar wiper blade thereby achieving an optimal wiping result even at high vehicle speed.It is especially advantageous in this case if the counter-hinge element is embodied as a circular opening, which is able to accommodate a hinge bolt. This type of wiper blade is quick and easy to replace and simple and cost-effective to manufacture.depicts the connecting device  in accordance with the invention with a section of a wiper blade  and of a wiper arm . The connecting device  is comprised essentially of a first connecting part  that is fastened to the wiper blade  as well as a second connecting part  that is fastened to the wiper arm . The wiper blade  is embodied as a so-called flat bar wiper blade, and is comprised essentially of a wiper blade rubber , which is held on a resilient rail . In order to improve the flow properties, a spoiler  is fastened on the side of the resilient rail  facing away from the wiper blade rubber , in particular slid onto the resilient rail , which is embodied of a rubber elastic material. The first connecting part  is firmly connected to the resilient rail  so that the wiper blade  is held securely on the first connection .The wiper arm  bears the second connecting part  on its free end; the wiper arm  in this case is embodied in the area of its free end as a single rod, which has an essentially rectangular cross section. The side of the rod that has a longer cross section runs perpendicularly to the window, which is not shown here for the sake of providing an unimpaired view. As a result, the longer side of the rectangular cross sections runs essentially parallel to the longitudinal extension of the cross section of the wiper blade . The second connecting part  is embodied here as a sheet metal bent part and grips around the free end of the wiper arm  with a first section  in a clamp-like manner. A second section  of the second connecting part  extends perpendicularly from the free end of the wiper arm  in the direction of the first connecting part  and overlaps it in a bridge-like manner. A securing means  is formed as a result, which is formed by a bridge  of the second section , which is terminated by a limit . The bridge  runs approximately perpendicularly to the longitudinal extension of the wiper arm , parallel to the surface of the window or approximately parallel to the plane which is formed by the resilient rails .The first connecting part  has a receptacle  to accommodate the bridge  and a pocket , wherein in a connected state, the bridge  is accommodated in the receptacle  and the limit  in the pocket . As a result, the first connecting part  and the second connecting part  engage with one another.In addition, provided on the second connecting part  is a bolt , which extends in the direction of the longitudinal extension of the wiper arm  at a distance from the bridge . The longitudinal extension of the bolt  runs perpendicularly to the longitudinal extension of the wiper arm  and therefore approximately parallel to the bridge . The bolt  engages in a counter-hinge element , which is embodied here as a pocket hole (), thereby forming a hinge element . The first connecting part  is thus rotatably connected to the second connecting part .The bolt  is embodied in this case in such a way that it fastens the second connecting part  to the free end of the wiper arm  on the one hand and at the same part is part of the hinge element .shows a top view of the connecting device  in accordance with the invention as well as the wiper blade  and the free end of the wiper arm . The free end of the wiper arm  is shown in its rectangular form perpendicular to the plane of the window, which in this case corresponds to the plane of the blade. Fastened to it is the second connecting part , with its first section  and its second section . The first second  clamps around the free end of the wiper arm  and is fastened to the wiper arm  by the bolt . The bolt  projects (not visible here) into the first connecting part . The second section  with the securing means  is arranged at a distance from this hinge axis, which is formed by the bolt . The securing means is comprised of the bridge , which is delimited by the limit . The bridge  in this case is inserted into the receptacle  of the first connecting part  so that an essentially smooth surface of the first connecting part  is produced. The limit  is inserted into the pocket  of the first connecting part. In the area of the pocket , the first connecting part  also has a spoiler wall , which essentially terminates the first connecting part . On the side of the receptacle  facing the hinge axis and therefore the bolt , the receptacle  is so much wider than the bridge  that a gap  is created, and namely such that the second connecting part  can be rotated around the hinge axis with respect to the first connecting part  by a detachment angle .depicts a variation of the second connecting part  of a connecting device  in accordance with the invention, which, however, is constructed to be functionally identical. The same elements were therefore identified by the same reference numbers. The bolt  that forms the hinge axis is fastened on the first section  of the second connecting part . At a distance from this is the securing means , which is essentially comprised of the bridge  and the limit . The limit  projects perpendicularly downward and is embodied to be a single piece with the bridge . As a result, both an inner wall  and an outer wall  are formed on the limit . The inner wall  and the outer wall  limit the axial movement on the hinge axis by forming limit stops in the pocket  of the first connecting part .In addition, the limit  has a shoulder  to stabilize and improve fastening and said shoulder enlarges the limit  in the direction of the bolt  and therefore in the direction of the hinge axis. For stabilization purposes, a raised portion  is also embodied on the bridge , which increases the flexural strength of the bridge . Typically, the raised portion  is bent directly out of the sheet metal of the bridge . In a variation of the invention, the raised portion  can also be embodied downward, i.e., as an indentation.shows a perspective representation of the first connecting part  of a connecting device  in accordance with the invention with the wiper blade . The wiper blade  is comprised of a spoiler , which is fastened to the resilient rail . Just like the spoiler , the first connecting part  is also fastened to the resilient rail . In a variation, the first connecting part  can also be fastened to the spoiler . The first connecting part  has an opening as a counter-hinge element , which is used to accommodate the bolt  so that a hinge element  () is formed together with the bolt . The opening  can be embodied in this case as a continuous hole or as a pocket hole.The receptacle , which is able to accommodate the bridge  in a mounted state, is at a distance from its hinge axis, which is formed by the bolt  and the counter-hinge element . The receptacle  is comprised in this case of a base  as well as a first side wall  and a second side wall , which is arranged on the side of the receptacle  facing the hinge element . The base  of the receptacle  has a longitudinal shaped portion  in the area of the second side wall , which runs parallel to the hinge axis and therefore parallel to the counter-hinge element . In this case, the longitudinal shaped portion , just like the receptacle , extends from the pocket  to the outer limit of the first connecting part  so that the shoulder  of the second connecting part is able to glide through the longitudinal shaped portion . In its inner contour, the pocket  follows the limit  with the shoulder  of the second connecting part .shows a side view of the wiper blade  with the first connecting part  of the connecting device  in accordance with the invention. The view in this case is from the side on which the wiper arm  or the second connecting part  is arranged in a mounted state. In cross section, the first connecting part  has a turtle-shaped, hump-shaped upper side , which is terminated on one side by the spoiler wall . The spoiler wall  projects in this case beyond the turtle-shaped surface . The counter-hinge element , which is used to accommodate the bolt  (), is arranged at a distance from the receptacle  in the longitudinal direction of the wiper blade . The receptacle  is comprised of the base , the first side wall  and the second side wall . The longitudinal shaped portion , which extends downward in the direction of the resilient rail , is provided in the base  in the area of the second side wall . The first side wall  runs essentially perpendicularly to the base . The second side wall  with the base  therefore encloses an angle of over 90°, in particular of over 100°. In this way, a groove-shaped longitudinal shaped portion  is produced, through which the shoulder  of the limit  of the second connecting part  can be guided during assembly. The depth of the receptacle  or the height of the first side wall  in this case is dimensioned in such a way that the bridge  of the securing means  of the second connecting part  can be completely accommodated such that the turtle-shaped curved upper side of the first connecting part  terminates just approximately flush except for the gap .The base  and the bridge  in this case have a width of between 3 mm and 15 mm, in particular between 5 mm and 10 mm, preferably between 7 mm and 9 mm, ideally 8 mm. The bridge  in this case has a length between 10 mm and 30 mm, in particular between 15 mm and 25 mm, preferably between 18 mm and 23 mm, ideally approximately 22 mm. These dimensions allow adequate stability to be achieved with an especially compact design.In the upper area of the second side wall  facing away from the longitudinal shaped portion , an edge  is formed by a planar section so that when the bridge  is rotating with respect to the first connecting part  it cannot rotate beyond a predetermined detachment angle . As a result, a limit stop is formed, which brings about simple detachment of the two connecting parts , . The second side wall  can also comprise a first section and a second section, wherein the first section projects approximately perpendicularly from the base  and the second section, which is adjacent to the first section, encloses an opening angle of greater than 180 degrees with the base . The width of the base  is then selected to be approximately as large as the width of the bridge , wherein the gap  is formed by the opening angle of the second section.The first connecting part  is clamped firmly on the spring rail  by clamping elements . The longitudinal shaped portion  in this case is dimensioned in such a way with the shoulder  of the second connecting part  () that the detachment angle  is approximately 25 degrees, i.e., that by rotating the first connecting part  by 25 degrees with respect to the second connecting part , the axial locking of the hinge element  is lifted since the limit  is situated in cross section completely within the receptacle  with the longitudinal shaped portion . As a result, through an axial displacement on the hinge axis or on the bolt , the first connecting part  can be detached from the second connecting part .shows a top view of the first connecting part  of the connecting device  in accordance with the invention with the wiper blade . The turtle-shaped surface  of the first connecting part  is interrupted by the receptacle . Said surface is limited along the longitudinal extension of the receptacle  on one end by the spoiler wall . Arranged between the spoiler wall  and the receptacle  is the pocket , which is able to accommodate the limit  with the shoulder  of the second connecting part.depicts the connecting device  in accordance with the invention as well as the free end of the wiper arm  and the wiper blade  in the detachment position, i.e., in the position in which both of the connecting parts ,  can be detached. The bridge  in this case is tilted up to the edge  by a rotation around the hinge axis or around the bolt  so that the bridge  hits the edge . The spoiler wall  in this case fits snugly over the spoiler  and projects a little bit over the spoiler . The spoiler  is integrated into the spoiler wall  in this manner.shows a connecting device  in accordance with the invention during the detachment process. The first connecting part  is fastened to the wiper blade  and the second connecting part  is fastened to the wiper arm . The second connecting part  grips around the wiper arm  with its U-shaped first section . The bolt  projects out of the base of the U-shaped section  perpendicularly to the longitudinal extension of the wiper arm  into the opening of the first connecting part  forming the counter-hinge element . The second section  of the second connecting part , which is formed by the securing means  with the bridge  and the limit , is shown here rotated around the detachment angle  so that the limit  is pulled out of the pocket  by the rotation around the hinge element . During axial displacement of the two connecting parts , , the limit  glides through the receptacle , whereby the shoulder  () moves through the longitudinal shaped portion . The first connecting part  and the second connecting part  are thus no longer engaged with one another.shows a side view of the connecting device  from  during detachment. The wiper arm , which bears the second connecting part , and the wiper blade , which bears the first connecting part , are rotated around the detachment angle  of approximately 25 degrees. In this way, the limit  with the shoulder  is pulled out of the pocket  so that the wiper blade  can be detached from the wiper arm  by an axial displacement on the hinge axis. As described in , the shoulder  then moves through the longitudinal shaped portion  and the remaining area of the limit  through the receptacle  that is essentially U-shaped in cross section. The gap  in this case is still very small or equal to 0 since in this position the bridge  hits against the limit stop, which is formed by the edge .The first connecting part in this case is embodied as a plastic injection molded part. It can also be reinforced by an additional sheet metal bent part or be embodied of fiber-reinforced plastic. An embodiment of the entire first connecting part as a sheet metal bent part is also possible. The second connecting part  is embodied as a sheet metal bent part and compressed, crimped or adhered on the free end of the wiper arm . It is just as possible, as shown here, to embody the second connecting part  in such a way that it is fastened positively or frictionally to the free end of the wiper arm . In addition, the bolt  can pass through the free end of the wiper arm  and be secured to it or fastened in another manner, for example by laser or induction welding. In particular, the fastening can be accomplished in such a way that with a mere form closure between the free end of the wiper arm  and the second connecting part  it is still locked by the bolt . In a simple and cost-effective variation, the second connecting part can naturally also be embodied of plastic or fiber reinforced plastic. Even a combination as a plastic part with sheet metal reinforcement is possible.In another variation, rubber elastic damping elements can be arranged in the area of the pocket  and/or in the area of the bridge  on the wiper arm side in order to minimize noise during wiper operation and/or to equalize tolerances."

                "This application claims the priority of United Kingdom Application No. 1010955.1, filed Jun. 30, 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.This invention relates to a surface treating appliance and in particular to a vacuum cleaner comprising at least one cyclone.Surface treating appliances, for example vacuum cleaners can separate dirt and dust from an airflow without the use of a filter bag. These so-called bagless vacuum cleaners are very popular. Most bagless vacuum cleaners use cyclonic or centrifugal separation to spin dirt and dust from the airflow. By avoiding the use of a filter bag as the primary form of separation, it has been found to be possible to maintain a consistently high level of suction, even as the collecting chamber fills with dirt.The principle of cyclonic separation in domestic vacuum cleaners is described in a number of publications including EP 0 042 723. In general, an airflow in which dirt and dust is entrained enters a first cyclonic separator via a tangential inlet which causes the airflow to follow a spiral or helical path within a collection chamber so that the dirt and dust is separated from the airflow. Relatively clean air passes out of the chamber while the separated dirt and dust is collected therein. In some applications, the airflow is then passed through a second and possibly a third stage of cyclonic separation which is capable of separating finer dirt and dust than the upstream cyclone. The airflow is thereby cleaned to a greater degree so that, by the time the airflow exits the cyclonic separating apparatus, the airflow is almost completely free of dirt and dust particles.Small cyclones can be desirable as they may be able to separate smaller particles of dust. In particular it has been found that small tip (dirt outlet) diameters on cyclones can increase separation efficiency. However, it has also been found that as the cyclones decrease in size there is an increased risk of them blocking, which would impact of the overall separation efficiency of the surface treating appliance.A first aspect of the present invention provides a surface treating appliance or cyclonic separating apparatus comprising at least one cyclone wherein at least a portion of at least one cyclone is flexible. Advantageously, having a flexible portion may help to prevent dirt from building up inside the cyclone during use of the surface treating appliance.In one embodiment the entire cyclone is flexible. In another embodiment the cyclone comprises a rigid portion and a flexible portion. Preferably the flexible portion includes at least a flexible tip of the cyclone.The cyclone may comprise at least one dirty air inlet. The dirty air inlet may be provided on a flexible portion of the cyclone. Alternatively the dirty air inlet may be provided on a rigid portion of the cyclone. The dirty air inlet may be formed as an integral inlet portion of the cyclone.The cyclone may comprise a dirt outlet. The dirt outlet may be provided in a flexible portion, and in particular at an end of a flexible tip of the at least one cyclone. For example, the at least one dirty air inlet may be located in a rigid portion of the cyclone, and the dirt outlet may be located in a flexible portion of the cyclone.The cyclone may be frusto-conical in shape. In this case, the cyclone may have a relatively wide, rigid portion comprising the at least one dirty air inlet, and a relatively narrow, flexible portion comprising the dirt outlet so that only the portion of the cyclone comprising the dirt outlet vibrates during use of the cyclone. Forming the at least one dirty air inlet in a rigid portion of the cyclone can enable the size of the at least one dirty inlet to be maintained in a stationary position during use of the cyclone, and can enable the size of the at least one dirty air inlet to be maintained constant during use of the cyclone.The cyclone may be a reverse flow cyclone.As used herein the term “flexible” shall be taken to mean that the portion of the at least one cyclone which is flexible will be deflected more than 1 mm when subjected to the test conditions described in Test  or Test  in the specific description and shown in to As an example, the flexible portion may have a Shore A value of up to 80 Shore A, for example the flexible portion may have a Shore A value of from 20, or 25, or 30, or 35 to 40 or 45, or 50, or 55, or 60. The entire cyclone or a flexible portion of the cyclone may be formed from an elastomer, for example a plastics material, or rubber. The entire cyclone or a flexible portion of the cyclone may be formed, for example, from a thermoplastic elastomer, TPU, silicon rubber or natural rubber.As used herein the term “rigid” shall be taken to mean that the portion of the at least one cyclone which is rigid will be deflected less than 1 mm when subjected to the test conditions described in Test  or Test  in the specific description and as shown in to As an example, the rigid portion may have a Shore D value of above 60 Shore D, for example the rigid portion may have a Shore D value of from 60, or 65, or 70, to 75, or 80, or 85 or 90. The rigid portion may be formed from a plastics or metal material, for example poly propylene, ABS or aluminium.As used herein the term “tip” shall be taken to mean an end portion of the at least one cyclone. In a preferred embodiment the tip may be a lower end portion of the at least one cyclone. The tip may comprise up to 95% of the total length of the cyclone but more preferably the tip may be 50% or less than the total length of the at least one cyclone. For example the tip may be from 5, or 10, or 15, or 20 to 25, or 30, or 35, or 40% of the total length of the at least one cyclone. In a preferred embodiment the tip may have a wall thickness of from 0.2, or 0.5 to 1 or 1.5 mm. Part of the flexible portion of the at least one cyclone may comprise the tip. Alternatively, the tip may form the flexible portion of the at least one cyclone.In a particular embodiment where the cyclone comprises a rigid portion and a flexible portion, the flexible portion may be over-molded on to the rigid portion of the at least one cyclone. Additionally or alternatively the flexible portion may be glued, fixed or clamped to the rigid portion by any suitable method or by using any suitable fixing means. The flexible portion is preferably attached to the rigid portion in an airtight manner. The flexible portion may be fixed to the rigid portion such that there is a step, either internal or external, between the flexible portion and the rigid portion. Preferably the inner surface of the at least one cyclone is smooth or otherwise such that there is no step between the rigid portion and the flexible portion.The at least one cyclone may be from 5 mm to 400 mm in length, for example the at least one cyclone may be from 10, or 20, or 30, or 40, or 50, or 60 or 70, to 100, or 200, or 300, or 400 mm in length. The dirt outlet may have a diameter of from 0.2 to 20 mm, for example the dirt outlet may have a diameter of from, 0.2, or 0.4, or 0.5, or 0.6, or 0.8 to 1, or 1.5, or 2, or 5, or 10 mm. The dirt outlet may be chamfered. In an embodiment where the dirt outlet is chamfered the dirt outlet diameter may be measured as the diameter at the uppermost point of the dirt outlet.At least a portion of the at least one cyclone may be arranged to vibrate as airflow moves through the surface treating apparatus during use. Constructing a flexible portion from a material having a Shore A value of from 20 to 60 has been found to result in a flexible portion which vibrates as airflow moves through the surface treating apparatus during use. In particular the dirt outlet in the flexible portion has been found to vibrate.In a particularly preferred embodiment where a flexible tip was formed using material having a Shore A hardness of 20 and having a dirt outlet diameter of 0.5 mm, the flexible tips were found to vibrate at around 500 Hz, at an amplitude of approx 0.05 mm. This had the effect of breaking off dust deposits before they could load up and block the flexible tip of the cyclone. This frequency and amplitude of vibration was achieved by the airflow through the cyclone exciting the dirt outlet at its natural frequency. Thus using such a cyclone advantageously may mean that smaller cyclones, that previously would have been liable to blockage, may now be used. Being able to utilize smaller cyclones may therefore also advantageously increase the overall separation efficiency of the surface treating appliance.The surface treating apparatus may further comprise means for dilating, inflating, deforming, compressing and/or moving a flexible portion of the at least one cyclone, and so in a second aspect the present invention provides a surface treating appliance or cyclonic separating apparatus comprising a cyclone having a flexible portion, and means for dilating, inflating, deforming, compressing and/or moving the flexible portion.A flexible portion of the at least one cyclone, for example the flexible tip, may be dilatable such that it can be dilated and/or relaxed in order to change its shape and or dimensions. The flexible portion may be arranged such that in its relaxed state the dirt outlet has a smaller diameter than when it is in its dilated state. In this way during use of the surface treating appliance the flexible portion is relaxed such that it has a small diameter dirt outlet, thus increasing the separation efficiency of the cyclone. Then, after use, the flexible portion can be dilated to increase the diameter of the dirt outlet to help dislodge any dirt which may have built up in the flexible portion during use.A flexible portion of the at least one cyclone, for example the flexible tip, may be inflatable such that it can be partially or totally filed with a fluid in order to change its shape and/or dimensions. The flexible portion may be arranged such that in its inflated state the dirt outlet has a smaller diameter than when it is in its deflated state. In this way during use of the surface treating appliance the flexible portion can be inflated such that it has a small diameter dirt outlet, thus increasing the separation efficiency of the cyclone. Then, after use, the flexible portion can be deflated to increase the diameter of the dirt outlet to help dislodge any dirt which may have built up in the flexible portion during use.Additionally or alternatively the cyclonic separating apparatus may further comprise a device for manually, or mechanically, moving or compressing a flexible portion of the cyclone. For example, the device may comprise a paddle, pad, arm or rod which may be arranged to hit against, compress or move a flexible portion of the cyclone, for example the flexible tip, in order to try to help dislodge any dirt which may have become trapped in the flexible portion during use of the surface treating appliance.In a preferred embodiment the surface treating appliance comprises a plurality of cyclones, wherein at least a portion of one cyclone, but preferably at least a portion of each of the cyclones, may be flexible. The plurality of cyclones may be arranged in parallel in terms of airflow through the cyclones.In a third aspect the present invention provides a surface treating appliance or cyclonic separating apparatus comprising a plurality of frusto-conical cyclones arranged in parallel and each having a relatively wide, rigid frusto-conical portion and a relatively narrow, flexible frusto-conical portion connected to the relatively wide portion, the relatively wide portion comprising at least one dirty air inlet and the relatively narrow portion comprising a dirt outlet.The plurality of cyclones may also be arranged such that they are physically in parallel with each other. For example, the cyclones may be arranged about an axis, with the cyclones being equally spaced from the axis and, preferably equally spaced about, the axis.Alternatively one or more cyclones may be arranged as a stack, either in single rows or in groups. For example, the plurality of cyclone may comprise a first set of cyclones arranged in a first arrangement about the axis, and a second set of cyclones arranged in a second arrangement about the axis and spaced along the axis from the first set.The surface treating appliance may further comprise one or more rigid cyclones arranged either upstream or downstream of the cyclone(s). The rigid cyclone(s) may be arranged in parallel or in series in terms of airflow through the rigid cyclone(s).In a particular embodiment the plurality of cyclones may form at least a part of a filter cartridge which may be removable from the remainder of the surface treating appliance. This may advantageously allow the filter cartridge to be more easily cleaned and/or replaced if desired.The plurality of cyclones may be orientated such that their longitudinal axes are vertical or substantially vertical. In a preferred embodiment their longitudinal axes may be substantially parallel or parallel, and preferably parallel to said axis about which the cyclones are arranged.In an alternative embodiment the cyclones may be arranged in an annular arrangement with their dirt outlets pointing substantially inwardly. The cyclones may be orientated such that their longitudinal axes are horizontal or substantially horizontal. Alternatively the cyclones may be orientated such that their longitudinal axes are inclined to said axis about which the cyclones are arranged.In embodiments where there is a rigid portion and a flexible tip or portion, one or more of the flexible tips or portions may be bent, curved or shaped away from the longitudinal axis of the rigid portion.Two or more layers or sets of cyclones may be stacked to form a column of cyclones arranged with a parallel airflow path through each of the cyclones.The cyclones preferably form part of a cyclonic separating apparatus comprising a first cyclonic cleaning stage and a second cyclonic cleaning stage located downstream from the first cyclonic cleaning stage and comprising the plurality of cyclones.The term “surface treating appliance” is intended to have a broad meaning, and includes a wide range of machines having a head for travelling over a surface to clean or treat the surface in some manner. It includes, inter alia, machines which apply suction to the surface so as to draw material from it, such as vacuum cleaners (dry, wet and wet/dry), as well as machines which apply material to the surface, such as polishing/waxing machines, pressure washing machines, ground marking machines and shampooing machines. It also includes lawn mowers and other cutting machines. In a preferred embodiment the surface treating appliance is a vacuum cleaner.Features described above in connection with the first aspect of the invention are equally applicable to each of the second and third aspects of the invention, and vice versa.Like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the specification.illustrates a surface treating appliance, which in this example is a vacuum cleaner . The vacuum cleaner  comprises a main body  and a rolling support structure  mounted on the main body  for maneuvering the vacuum cleaner  across a surface to be cleaned. A cleaner head  is pivotably mounted on the lower end of the rolling support structure  and a dirty air inlet  is provided on the underside of the cleaner head  facing the surface to be cleaned. A separating apparatus  is removably provided on the main body  and ducting  provides communication between the dirty air inlet  and the separating apparatus . A wand and handle assembly  is mounted on the main body  behind the separating apparatus .In use, a motor and fan unit (not shown) which is located inside the rolling support structure  draws dust laden air into the vacuum cleaner  via either the dirty air inlet  or the wand . The dust laden air is carried to the separating apparatus  via the ducting  and the entrained dust particles are separated from the air and retained in the separating apparatus . The cleaned air passes through the motor and is then ejected from the vacuum cleaner .The separating apparatus  forming part of the vacuum cleaner  is shown generally in . The specific overall shape of the separating apparatus  can be varied according to the type of vacuum cleaner  in which the separating apparatus  is to be used. For example, the overall length of the separating apparatus  can be increased or decreased with respect to the diameter of the separating apparatus .The separating apparatus  comprises a first cyclonic cleaning stage  and a second cyclonic cleaning stage . In some embodiments the separating apparatus  also comprises a pre motor filter  located longitudinally through the separating apparatus .The first cyclonic cleaning stage  comprises an annular chamber  located between the outer wall  of the separating apparatus , which wall  is substantially cylindrical in shape, and a second cylindrical wall  which is located radially inwardly of and spaced from the outer wall . The lower end of the first cyclonic cleaning stage  is closed by a base  which is pivotably attached to the outer wall  by means of a pivot  and held in a closed position by a catch . In the closed position, the base  is sealed against the lower ends of the walls , . Releasing the catch  allows the base  to pivot away from the outer wall  and the second cylindrical wall  for emptying of the first cyclonic cleaning stage  and the second cyclonic cleaning stage .The top portion of the annular chamber  forms a cylindrical cyclone  of the first cyclonic cleaning stage  and the lower portion of the annular chamber  forms a dust collecting bin . The second cyclonic cleaning stage  comprises twelve secondary cyclones , which are arranged in parallel in terms of airflow through the cyclones , and a second dust collecting chamber .A dust laden air inlet  is provided in the outer wall . The dust laden air inlet  is arranged tangentially to the outer wall  so as to ensure that incoming dust laden air is forced to follow a helical path around the annular chamber . A fluid outlet from the first cyclonic cleaning stage  is provided in the form of a mesh shroud . The mesh shroud  comprises a cylindrical wall  in which a large number of perforations  are formed. The only fluid outlet from the first cyclonic cleaning stage  is formed by the perforations  in the shroud .illustrates a section through a first embodiment of the cyclonic separating apparatus . A passageway  is formed downstream of the shroud . The passageway  communicates with the second cyclonic cleaning stage . The passageway  may be in the form of an annular chamber which leads to inlets  of the secondary cyclones  or may be in the form of a plurality of distinct air passageways each of which leads to a separate secondary cyclone .A third cylindrical wall  extends downwardly towards the base . The third cylindrical wall  is located radially inwardly of, and is spaced from, the second cylindrical wall  so as to form the second dust collecting chamber . When the base  is in the closed position, the third cylindrical wall  is sealed against the base .The secondary cyclones  are arranged substantially or totally above the first cyclonic cleaning stage . The secondary cyclones  are arranged in an annular arrangement which is centered on the axis of the first cyclonic cleaning stage . In this embodiment, each secondary cyclone  has an axis which is generally parallel to the axis of the first cyclonic cleaning stage.Each secondary cyclone  is generally frusto-conical in shape. The relatively narrow portion of each secondary cyclone  comprises a dirt outlet  which opens into the top of the second dust collecting chamber . In use dust separated by the secondary cyclones  will exit through the dirt outlets  and will be collected in the second dust collecting chamber . A vortex finder  is provided at a relatively wide, upper end of each secondary cyclone  to provide an air outlet from the secondary cyclone . Where provided, the vortex finders  communicate with the pre motor filter . Each vortex finder  extends through a generally annular top wall  of the secondary cyclone .In the embodiment shown in  the secondary cyclones  are made entirely of a flexible material, for example rubber, so that the secondary cyclones  are deformable. The flexible material is preferably rubber, which in this embodiment has a Shore A value of 22. During use of the vacuum cleaner , the secondary cyclones  vibrate as airflow passes through them. This vibration has been found to help prevent a build up of dirt within the secondary cyclones . The second dust collecting chamber  is ideally separated from atmospheric pressure to prevent the secondary cyclones  from collapsing.Each secondary cyclone  has a secondary cyclone dirty air inlet  which may be formed from the same material as the remainder of the secondary cyclones . In addition, the vortex finders  and the top wall  of the secondary cyclones  may also be formed from a flexible material.illustrates a second embodiment of the cyclonic separating apparatus . In this second embodiment, each secondary cyclone  has a rigid upper portion  and a flexible lower portion, comprising a flexible tip . The flexible material from which the flexible tips are formed is preferably rubber with a Shore A value of 20. The rigid material is preferably polypropylene with a Shore D value of 60.It has been found that the flexible tips  vibrate as airflow passes through the secondary cyclones  during use of the vacuum cleaner . This vibration has been found to help prevent a build up of dirt within the secondary cyclones . illustrates (i) rotation, (ii) compression and (iii) side to side movements as examples of the types of vibration which have been found to occur in the flexible tips  as airflow passes through the secondary cyclones .As shown in the flexible tips  are preferably less than one third of the total length of the secondary cyclones . The secondary cyclones  are 65.5 mm in length and have a dirt outlet diameter of 3.3 mm. The flexible tips  are 15 mm in length. The flexible tips  are over-molded on to the rigid portions  such that the inner surfaces  of the secondary cyclones  are smooth. In this embodiment, the secondary cyclones  are arranged so that the axes of the second cyclones  are inclined inwardly relative to, and towards, the longitudinal axis of the first cyclonic cleaning stage .With reference now to , the vacuum cleaner  may also further comprise means for dilating, inflating, deforming, compressing and/or moving the flexible tips  of the secondary cyclones .  show embodiments where the flexible tips  are dilatable or inflatable by different methods.  shows an embodiment where the vacuum cleaner  has a device for contacting, flicking or knocking the flexible tips .and illustrate a dilatable flexible tip . The flexible tip  comprises an inner wall  and an outer wall  which may be integrally formed or joined to form a tip chamber  therebetween. shows the flexible tip  in its relaxed state and shows the flexible tip  in its dilated state. The flexible tips  may move between their relaxed and dilated states in response to pressure changes within the cyclonic separating apparatus . The flexible tip  is over-molded onto a rigid portion  of the secondary cyclone . The dirt outlet  is largest when the flexible tip  is in its dilated state, as shown inIn an alternative embodiment the tip chambers  may be inflated and deflated by passing a fluid into and out of the tip chambers .The preferred mode of operation is that the flexible tips  are relaxed so that the dirt outlet  is at its smallest diameter during use of the vacuum cleaner . When the vacuum cleaner  is switched off, the flexible tips  dilate to release dirt trapped in the secondary cyclones , for example into the second dust collecting chamber .In the embodiment shown in to the normal operating conditions of the vacuum cleaner , where the flexible tips  are in their relaxed state, are shown in to Airflow through the cyclonic separating apparatus  is indicated by the arrows shown in and shows the airflow from the first cyclonic cleaning stage  passing through the shroud , along the passageway  and into the inlets  of the secondary cyclones . shows the airflow from the secondary cyclones  passing through the pre motor filter  towards the motor and fan assembly. The off condition of the vacuum cleaner , where the flexible tips  are in their dilated position, is shown inDuring normal operation of the vacuum cleaner  (i.e. in to ) the second dust collecting chamber  will be at around 9 kPa below atmospheric pressure. There will be a similar pressure inside the secondary cyclones . In order to prevent the flexible tips  from inflating and blocking the dirt outlets , the pressure in the tip chambers  has to be equalized with the pressure inside the second dust collecting chamber  and the pressure inside the secondary cyclones . This is achieved by connecting the tip chambers  to a similarly low pressure. Thus each tip chamber  is fluidly connected to a pressure tap  which is located downstream of the pre motor filter .Locating the pressure tap  downstream of the pre motor filter  is advantageous because the air in this area is clean and will therefore reduce ingress of dust into the pressure tap  and thus into the tip chambers . It is also advantageous because the pressure available at the eye of the motor can achieve a maximum pressure difference to atmosphere, and give the largest dilation of the flexible tips . Certainly the pressure at this point is always lower than the pressure inside the second dust collecting chamber  and so inflation of the flexible tips  will not occur.During normal operation of the vacuum cleaner  the pressure at the pressure tap  is normally around 1.5 kPa (which is equal to the pressure drop across the pre motor filter ). This has the effect of applying a very slight dilation force to the flexible tips , but not enough to significantly deform them.Each tip chambers  is linked to a pressure tap  via a one way ball valve  in a large reservoir chamber . This reservoir chamber  is required to sustain a low pressure difference long enough to dilate the flexible tips  at around 10 kpa. Thus when the vacuum cleaner  is switched off, the pressure in the secondary cyclones  and the second dust collecting chamber  returns to atmospheric pressure. The tip chambers  however remain at below atmospheric pressure because of the one way ball valve . This means that when the vacuum cleaner  is switched off atmospheric pressure pushes the inner wall  of the flexible tip  towards the outer wall  of the flexible tip , causing the dirt outlet  to dilate as shown inThe seat  of the ball valve  is scored to allow a controlled leak of air back into the reservoir chamber  and tip chamber  to allow the flexible tips  to relax back into their relaxed position within a few seconds. This mechanism allows the flexible tips  to dilate and then quickly relax again each time the vacuum cleaner  is switched off, thereby helping to keep the secondary cyclones  free of trapped dirt.In the embodiment shown in and a control valve  is located in a pre motor filter housing  to allow instantaneous dilation of the flexible tips  at any time. The control valve  can be operated by any suitable electrical or mechanical means at a prescribed time interval. For example the control valve  may be controlled by an air muscle or mechanical means connected to the on/off switch of the vacuum cleaner . The normal operating condition of a vacuum cleaner is shown in During normal operation the control valve  is open and therefore the second dust collecting chamber  will be at around 9 kPa below atmospheric pressure. There will be a similar pressure inside the secondary cyclones  themselves. In order to prevent the flexible tips  from inflating and blocking the dirt outlets , the pressure in the tip chamber  has to be equalized with the pressure inside the second dust collecting chamber  and the pressure inside the secondary cyclones . Again this is achieved by connecting the tip chambers  to a similarly low pressure. Thus the tip chambers  are fluidly connected to a pressure tap  which is located downstream of the pre motor filter .During normal operation of the vacuum cleaner , the pressure difference between the second dust collecting chamber  and the pressure tap  is normally around 1.5 kPa, (which is equal to the pressure drop across the pre motor filter ). This has the effect of applying a very slight dilation force to the flexible tips , but not enough to significantly deform them. Thus while the vacuum cleaner  is in operation and the control valve  is open the flexible tips  will be in the relaxed position.When desired, for example when the vacuum cleaner  is switched off, the control valve  can be closed as shown in Closing the control valve  restricts the airflow through the secondary cyclones  and creates a large pressure drop inside the tip chambers  which will remain below atmospheric pressure while the second dust collecting chamber  and the secondary cyclones  return to atmospheric pressure. This causes the flexible tips  to dilate into the position shown in Once the flexible tips  have been dilated to help clear any trapped dirt, the control valve  can be returned to the open position shown in so that the flexible tips  return to their relaxed state.In the embodiment shown in  a controlled electro-mechanical pump  is arranged to remove the air around the flexible tip  to draw open the flexible tips  into the dilated position. The electro-mechanical pump  can be controlled at any specific time interval or its action could be related to the removal of the cyclonic separating apparatus  from the main body  of the vacuum cleaner . Alternatively control of the electro-mechanical pump  could be related to the switching on or switching off of the vacuum cleaner .In the embodiment shown in to the secondary cyclones  have a rigid upper portion  and a flexible tip . In addition the vacuum cleaner  comprises a plurality of paddles  which are arranged such that they can strike, flick or wipe the flexible tips . A large mechanical movement may be used to draw the flexible tips  relatively slowly to one side. As the paddles  move beyond the flexible tips  the flexible tips  will be released. Due to the material properties of the flexible tips  this action helps to accelerate the movement of the flexible tips  and allows them to flick back to the resting position with a series of fast vibrating oscillations. During this action, any dirt caught in the flexible tips  may be disrupted, dislodged from the inner surfaces  of the secondary cyclones  and drop into the second dust collecting chamber . shows an electric motor  which is arranged to move the paddles  relative to the secondary cyclones . In this embodiment the paddles  are arranged to move in a circle such that they flick the flexible tip  of each of the secondary cyclones  in turn. In a ratchet device  for turning the paddles  relative to the secondary cyclones  is shown. Such a ratchet device  may be connected to an air muscle, or alternatively operated on removal or replacement of the cyclonic separating apparatus  on the main body  of the vacuum cleaner .Alternative constructions of cyclonic separating apparatus  and cyclones  according to the present invention are shown in . In each of these embodiments each of a plurality of cyclones  has a rigid portion  and a flexible tip .and illustrate a plurality of cyclones  arranged in parallel in terms of airflow through the cyclones . The plurality of cyclones  are also arranged such that they are physically in parallel with each other. In this embodiment the plurality of cyclones  form the filter cartridge , shown in which may be removable from the remainder of the vacuum cleaner  for cleaning or replacement if desired. In and the plurality of cyclones  are orientated such that their longitudinal axes are parallel with each other.In an alternative embodiment shown in to the cyclones  are arranged in an annular arrangement with their dirt outlets  pointing substantially inwardly. The cyclones  are orientated such that their longitudinal axes are horizontal or substantially horizontal. In this embodiment the cyclones  form a filter cartridge , which may be removable from the remainder of the vacuum cleaner  for cleaning or replacement.In  the cyclones  are orientated such that their longitudinal axes are inclined and the flexible tips  are shaped away from the longitudinal axis of the rigid portion .In the embodiments shown in  a plurality of layers or sets of cyclones  are stacked to form a column of cyclones  arranged with a parallel airflow path through each of the cyclones . In , the sets of cyclones are spaced along the axis of the first cyclonic cleaning stage . In these embodiments, the vacuum cleaner  comprises a moving means for knocking and/or brushing the flexible tips . In  the moving means is a paddle  which is arranged to sweep about a circular path to engage and release sequentially the flexible tips . In  the moving means is a rod  which has a plurality of projections  arranged around and along its length. This rod  is arranged such that it can move relative to the flexible tips . In the embodiment shown the rod  is arranged to move up and down such that each projection flicks a flexible tip  in order to help remove any dust located in the flexible tip . If desired air muscle activation could be used to drive movement of the rod . In this embodiment, the cyclones  are arranged as a third stage of cyclonic separation . These cyclones are therefore arranged downstream of the secondary cyclones  in place of the pre motor filter.In order to determine whether a portion of a cyclone is “flexible” or “rigid” one or both of the following tests may be performed.The flexibility of a portion of the cyclone can be tested using a 2 mm diameter stylus with a 1 mm radius at the tip. The stylus can be shaped as A or B, as shown on The stylus is used to apply a Load L of 20 N to a point on the inner surface of the cyclone. The deflection of the cyclone surface is then ascertained. The shape distortion can be as C or D in at any point on the inner surface of the cyclone. A deflection (X) of at least 1 mm is taken to mean that the portion of the cyclone being tested is flexible. A deflection of less than 1 mm is taken to mean that the portion of the cyclone being tested is rigid.A wedge tool as shown at E in is used to apply a load L of 50 N. The elongation of the cyclone is measured. A deflection (X) of at least 1 mm is taken to mean that the portion of the cyclone being tested is flexible. A deflection of less than 1 mm is taken to mean that the portion of the cyclone being tested is rigid."

                "The specification relates to a reconfigurable surface cleaning apparatus. In a preferred embodiment, the surface cleaning apparatus has an upright cleaning unit, a surface cleaning head and a detachably mounted cleaning unit in airflow communication with the surface cleaning head. In use, the cleaning unit can be detached from the upright cleaning unit and moved independently from the upright cleaning unit optionally without having to reconfigure the airflow conduit between the cleaning unit and the surface cleaning head.The following is not an admission that anything discussed below is prior art or part of the common general knowledge of persons skilled in the art.Various types of surface cleaning apparatus are known. Typical upright vacuum cleaners include an upper section, including an air treatment member such as one or more cyclones and/or filters, drivingly mounted to a surface cleaning head. An up flow conduit is typically provided between the surface cleaning head and the upper section. In some such vacuum cleaners, a spine, casing or backbone extends between the surface cleaning head and the upper section for supporting the upper section. The air treatment member or members and/or the suction motor may be provided on the upper section.Surface cleaning apparatus having a portable cleaning module that is removably mounted to an upright vacuum cleaner are known. See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,309,600. In addition surface cleaning apparatus having a removably mounted hand vacuum cleaner are also known. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,635,315.The following introduction is provided to introduce the reader to the more detailed discussion to follow. The introduction is not intended to limit or define the claims.According to one broad aspect, a surface cleaning apparatus is provided is operable in an upright operating mode as an upright vacuum cleaner. For example, a vacuum cleaner may have a surface cleaning head for cleaning a floor. A support structure having a handle may be drivingly connected to the surface cleaning head such that a user can maneuver the surface cleaning head across the floor by manipulating the handle. The surface cleaning apparatus also comprises a cleaning unit, which is preferably a portable surface cleaning unit that is selectively detachably mounted to the support structure. The portable surface cleaning unit preferably provides the vacuum suction and air treatment for the surface cleaning apparatus and is connected in airflow, or fluid flow, communication with the surface cleaning head such that the floor can be cleaned by the surface cleaning head.Mounting the portable surface cleaning unit on the support structure increases the weight of the support structure and can affect the maneuverability and ease of use of the surface cleaning apparatus. Accordingly, in some cleaning situations the user may preferably detach the cleaning unit from the support structure and choose to operate the apparatus in a portable operating mode, e.g., carry the cleaning unit by hand or by a strap while still using the support structure to drivingly maneuver the surface cleaning head. When the cleaning unit is detached, a user may more easily maneuver the surface cleaning head around or under obstacles, like furniture and stairs.To enable the vacuum suction generated by the cleaning unit to reach the surface cleaning head when the portable surface cleaning unit is detached from the support structure, the airflow connection between the surface cleaning head and the cleaning unit is preferably at least partially formed by a flexible conduit, such as a flexible hose. The use of a flexible conduit allows a user to detach the portable surface cleaning unit and maintain a flow connection between the portable surface cleaning unit and the surface cleaning head without having to reconfigure or reconnect any portions of the airflow conduit.Accordingly, when the surface cleaning apparatus is in use, a user may detach the cleaning unit from the support structure without interrupting the airflow communication between the cleaning unit and the surface cleaning head. This allows a user to selectively detach and re-attach the cleaning unit to the support structure during use without having to stop and reconfigure the connecting hoses or airflow conduits.It is also preferred that the portable surface cleaning is detachably connected from fluid flow communication with the surface cleaning head and may have its own nozzle. Accordingly, the surface cleaning apparatus may have a third mode of operation, namely the cleaning unit may be operable as an independent portable surface cleaning apparatus, such as a hand vacuum cleaner.In other cleaning situations a user may wish to configure the surface cleaning apparatus into other portable operating configurations in which the cleaning unit is fluidly disconnected from the surface cleaning head and used as a separate cleaning apparatus, or connected to an auxiliary cleaning tool.It is also preferred that the portable surface cleaning unit is removable from the surface cleaning apparatus using only one handed operation. For example, the portable surface cleaning unit may be held in place on an upright section of the surface cleaning apparatus by gravity. Accordingly a user may use one hand to lift the portable surface cleaning unit of the surface cleaning apparatus while still operating the surface cleaning apparatus with the user's other hand. Optionally, a lock may be provided. In such a case, the lock is preferably operated using a single hand and the portable surface cleaning unit preferably remains in position when the lock is disengaged so that a user may use the same hand to release the lock and to then remove the portable surface cleaning unit.In one embodiment, a surface cleaning apparatus may comprise a floor cleaning unit comprising a surface cleaning head having a dirty air inlet, a cleaning head air outlet and an upright section comprising a handle drivingly connected to the surface cleaning head. The surface cleaning apparatus may also comprise a cleaning unit removably mounted to the handle. The cleaning unit can have an air inlet, an air outlet and a suction motor. The surface cleaning apparatus can also comprise an air flow path extending through the surface cleaning apparatus that includes a flexible air flow conduit forming at least part of an air flow path from the surface cleaning head to the cleaning unit. The flexible air flow conduit can include a portable portion that is removably mounted to the surface cleaning apparatus. The air flow path can also include a rigid extension wand. The surface cleaning apparatus has a plurality of operating modes comprising an upright operating mode wherein the surface cleaning apparatus is operable as an upright surface cleaning apparatus with the cleaning unit mounted to the handle and forming part of the air flow path. The plurality of operating modes also includes at least one additional operating mode comprising a first portable operating mode wherein the cleaning unit is removed from the handle and the portable portion is detached from the extension wand, and a second portable operating mode, in which the cleaning unit is removed from the handle, the portable portion is connected to the extension wand and the extension wand is detached from the surface cleaning head. The plurality of operating modes also includes at least one second additional operating mode comprising a third portable operating mode and a fourth portable operating mode. In the third portable operating mode the cleaning unit is removed from the handle, the portable portion is detached from the extension wand and the surface cleaning head is in fluid flow communication with the portable portion. In the fourth portable operating mode the cleaning unit is removed from the handle, the portable portion is connected to the extension wand and the surface cleaning head is in fluid flow communication with the extension wand.In some examples the surface cleaning apparatus is operable in the first and second portable operating modes.In some examples the surface cleaning apparatus is operable in the third and fourth portable operating modes.In some examples the surface cleaning apparatus is operable in the third and fourth portable operating modes.In some examples the handle comprises the extension wand.In some examples, the cleaning unit is useable by itself without any attachments. Preferably, it has a built in surface cleaning nozzle. Any such nozzle known in the vacuum art may be used. Accordingly, when disconnected from the flexible air flow conduit, the cleaning unit may be directly ready for use.In some examples, the flexible air flow conduit may comprise a portable portion that is removably mounted to the surface cleaning apparatus and the surface cleaning apparatus has at least one additional operating mode wherein the cleaning unit is operable when removed from the handle together with the portable portion of the flexible air flow conduit.In some examples, the portable portion comprises a handle and has an end distal to the cleaning unit and the distal end is adapted to receive a cleaning tool.In some examples, the flexible air flow conduit has an end proximate the cleaning unit and the proximate end is removably mounted in air flow communication with the cleaning unit and the surface cleaning apparatus has at least one additional operating mode wherein the cleaning unit is operable when removed from the handle and from the flexible air flow conduit.In some examples, the cleaning unit comprises a hand vacuum cleaner. Alternately, the cleaning unit may be carriable by, e.g., a strap.In some examples, the surface cleaning apparatus may comprise an attachment member that is removably attached to the cleaning unit and the flexible air flow conduit is mounted to the attachment member.In some examples, the attachment member forms part of airflow path from the surface cleaning head to the cleaning unit.In some examples, the flexible air flow conduit is removably mounted to the attachment member.In some examples, the handle comprises a cleaning unit mount that removably receives the attachment member.In some examples, the cleaning unit is mounted to the upright section at a position spaced from the surface cleaning head.In some examples, cleaning unit further comprises a nozzle that is selectively connectable in air flow communication with an accessory cleaning tool and the air flow path from the surface cleaning head to the cleaning unit.In some examples, the cleaning unit comprises a hand vacuum cleaner having a nozzle that is configured for directly cleaning a surface.In some examples, the upright section has an absence of a housing defining a recess for receiving the cleaning unit.In some examples, the upright section comprises one or more thin support members.In some examples, the upright section consists essentially of one or more thin support members.It will be appreciated that an embodiment may contain one or more of features set out in the examples,Various apparatuses or methods will be described below to provide an example of each claimed invention. No example described below limits any claimed invention and any claimed invention may cover processes or apparatuses that are not described below. The claimed inventions are not limited to apparatuses or processes having all of the features of any one apparatus or process described below or to features common to multiple or all of the apparatuses described below. It is possible that an apparatus or process described below is not an embodiment of any claimed invention.The following description describes various embodiments of an upright surface cleaning apparatus, for example an upright vacuum cleaner. The upright surface cleaning apparatus generally comprises a support structure or upright section that is movably connected to a surface cleaning head.Referring to ,  to ,  and  to , examples of an upright surface cleaning apparatus  are shown which exemplifies the design using a cleaning unit that is a hand vacuum cleaner .  exemplify the design using a cleaning unit that is a portable cleaning apparatus , that need not be configured to operate as a separate hand vacuum cleaner when detached from the cleaning apparatus .The surface cleaning apparatus  is a vacuum cleaner that comprises a floor cleaning unit  comprising a surface cleaning head  having a support structure  pivotally mounted thereto and a cleaning unit, for example hand vacuum cleaner  or portable surface cleaning apparatus , that is removably mounted to support structure . Support structure  may also be referred to as a handle, a backbone or an upright section. In this specification, the terms portable surface cleaning apparatus , hand vacuum and hand vacuum cleaner  are used alternately to refer to the cleaning unit.It will be appreciated that in each example, the surface cleaning apparatus  need not be a portable cleaning unit having a dirty air inlet for cleaning a surface, for example the portable cleaning apparatus  illustrated in . Instead it may be a cleaning unit that houses a suction motor and one or more air treatment members (e.g., one or more cyclones with one or more filters). Such a cleaning unit does not have a dirty air inlet adapted to clean a floor. Instead, it is configured to receive dirty air conveyed from floor cleaning unit . For example, the cleaning unit may be detachable from the support structure  as exemplified in ,  and  but flexible hose  may not be removable from the cleaning head, floor cleaning unit  or the cleaning unit. The support structure  (or other elements) may also comprise cord wind members  (as exemplified in ,  and ) for winding the power cord of the vacuum cleaner  when not in use.In accordance with a first aspect, the support structure may be of any particular design that is flexible or bendable at a location between the upper end and the lower end of the support structure when in use. Preferably, the support structure includes a hinge that pivotally connects an upper and lower portion of the support structure. In accordance with this aspect, the support structure comprises first and second portions wherein the second portion is rotatable relative to the first portion about an axis that intersects a longitudinal axis of at least one of the first and second portions.As exemplified in , -,  and -, the support structure  (also referred to as the handle ) has an upper portion  and a lower portion  that are preferably pivotally connected by a hinge . Any type of hinge, pivot or bending mechanism known in the vacuum cleaner arts may be used provided that grip  may be moved forwardly with respect to the upper end of lower portion . The handle  is attached to the surface cleaning head  and a user can move the surface cleaning head  along a surface to be cleaned by gripping and maneuvering the handle . Optionally, the lower portion  of the handle  may be moveably, e.g., hingedly or pivotally, attached to the surface cleaning head , so that the lower portion  of the handle  can move relative to the surface cleaning head  during use. This may enable the user to move the surface cleaning head  beneath cabinets, furniture or other obstacles.In other examples, as exemplified in , the support structure, or handle , may not have a bendable or hinged configuration. In this example, the handle  may include an upper portion  and a complimentary lower portion  that are rigidly connected by an intervening member, for example detachable wand . In this example, the upper and lower portions ,  cooperate with the wand , and optional coupling chamber  formed in the housing of the portable cleaning apparatus , to provide the support structure  and floor cleaning unit .The upper portion  of the handle optionally includes a handgrip or grip  that is shaped to be gripped by a user. In the examples shown, the grip  is at the top, or upper end of the upper portion  of the handle  and is formed in a closed loop-type shape having surfaces that are rounded to increase user comfort. In other examples, the grip  may be of a different configuration and may be located at a different position on the upper portion  of the handle .Alternately, or in addition, the upper portion  of the handle  optionally includes a bracket , as exemplified in , which supports an auxiliary, or accessory or supplemental cleaning tool . In the example shown, the bracket  is configured to hold a single auxiliary cleaning tool , but in other examples the bracket  may be configured to hold more than one auxiliary cleaning tool . Also, while shown attached to the upper portion , it is understood that the bracket  may be attached to other locations on the surface cleaning apparatus, including the lower portion  as exemplified in , the rigid extension wand  as exemplified in , the surface cleaning head  and/or the hand vacuum cleaner  or portable cleaning apparatus .Optionally, the cleaning unit is not retrained within, e.g., a recess, in an outer housing or other portion of the support structure. As exemplified in , -, , - and -, an upright vacuum cleaner  has an absence of a housing or shell that has traditionally been used with upright vacuum cleaners. For example, no molded plastic shell is provided that houses operating components of the vacuum cleaner and includes a recess for receiving the hand vacuum cleaner  (or portable surface cleaning apparatus ). Instead, as exemplified, one or more support rods or structural members may be used, e.g., one as exemplified in , , - and - or two as exemplified in , so as to define a frame to removably receive the cleaning unit. In such an embodiment, the support rods may define a frame for removably receiving the cleaning unit. As exemplified, preferably the support rods or structural members that form the upper and lower portions ,  have a generally cylindrical or tube-like shape. However, in other examples, the upper and lower portions ,  may be any other type of relatively thin or elongated support members having suitable cross-sectional shape including square, rectangular or polygonal. In addition, the upper and lower portions ,  may be solid or hollow and may be formed from any suitable material, including plastic and metal. If one or both of the upper and lower portions ,  are hollow, then the hollow portion may form part of the air flow path through the vacuum cleaner, as exemplified in  and -.When the hinge  is in a first position, as shown in , , , , , ,  and - the upper and lower portions ,  of the handle  are generally aligned with each other, e.g., they each have a longitudinal axis and the axis are generally parallel. As exemplified in , the axis of the upper portion  may be located forward of the axis of the lower portion . The hinge  is preferably retained in this first position by a biasing or locking means so that the upper portion  of the handle  preferably remains at a fixed angular position with lower portion  when the lock is engaged so that forward and rearward movements applied to grip  of the upper portion  of the handle  can be translated to the second portion  as is known conventionally. In use, the hinge  can be unlocked, or released from the first position and upper portion  may be moved into one or more second fixed positions, wherein the grip  is preferably rotated forwardly. Optionally, the lock may remain in the unlocked position such that upper portion  may freely rotate with respect to the lower portion  while it is used to move the cleaning head.In examples in which the support structure  is articulated, as exemplified in , , , , , ,  and -, the grip  preferably comprises an actuator for releasing or unlocking the releasable lock or hinge , for example a button or hinge release  that can be activated by a user during use of vacuum cleaner  to unlock the hinge . It will be appreciated that the actuator may be of any type and may be located at any location and is preferably provided on the upper portion and is preferably adjacent the grip . When a user activates the hinge release , the retaining or locking means used to secure the hinge  in the first position is disengaged, allowing the hinge  to rotate or pivot, as shown in and . As the hinge  rotates, the first portion  of the handle  can be moved into a plurality of angular positions relative to the second portion  handle . Optionally, the hinge  may rotate between, and lock into, one or a given number of set or indexed angular positions. Alternatively, the rotation of the hinge  may be continuously variable, after being initially unlocked, allowing for the first portion  to be moved into an indefinite number of angular positions relative to the second portion  (e.g., freely rotatable). In examples in which the support structure  is not articulate (i.e. does not include a hinge) as exemplified in , the grip  may not include such an actuator.The upright surface cleaning apparatus also includes a cleaning unit, for example hand vacuum cleaner  or portable cleaning apparatus . The cleaning unit is attached to and supported by the support structure . Preferably, the cleaning unit is removably mounted to the support structure and it may be detachably mounted thereto. Preferably, in some configurations, the cleaning unit can be removable from support structure  while still in air flow communication with the cleaning head . Accordingly, in some examples, an attachment member  may be used to provide both a member to removably attach the cleaning unit to support structure  and an air flow connection when the cleaning unit is removed with the attachment member .In the some of the examples shown, the hand vacuum cleaner  is attached to the support structure  using a mount apparatus, for example mount . Preferably, instead of connecting directly to the hand vacuum cleaning , the mount apparatus is configured to receive a complimentary attachment apparatus, for example attachment member , which is connected, and preferably removably connected, to the hand vacuum cleaner . Preferably, as exemplified in , , , , -,  and -, the lower portion  comprises the mount  for supporting the hand vacuum cleaner . It will be appreciated that, alternately, mount  may be provided on upper portion .Hand vacuum cleaner  is preferably connected in fluid communication with the cleaning head  by a conduit that comprises, and may consist of, a flexible hose. In such a case, the lower portion  also optionally comprises a hose guide , as exemplified in , ,  and  for keeping the flexible hose  in close proximity to the support structure . When the hand vacuum cleaner  is detached or removed from the support structure  the flexible hose  may be removed from the hose guide , as shown in . In another example, as exemplified in ,  and -, a hose guide may not be included when the upstream end of the flexible hose  is connected in air flow communication with an upper end of the lower portion  instead of directly to the surface cleaning head .In some examples, as exemplified in , the flexible hose  may comprise substantially the entire length of the airflow conduit  connecting the hand vacuum  to the surface cleaning head . In other examples, as exemplified in FIGS.  and -, the flexible hose  may comprise only a portion of the airflow conduit  and another portion of the airflow conduit  may be formed by the lower portion  of the support structure  (e.g., a hollow support rod).In some examples, as exemplified in , the air flow path connecting the portable cleaning apparatus  to the surface cleaning head  can include the upper and lower portions , , the flexible hose  and the cleaning wand .In a second aspect, which may be used by itself or with any one or more other aspects, e.g., with or without a bendable wand and/or with or without a gravity mount, examples of the upright vacuum cleaner  may be operated in one or more of the following functional configurations or operating modes, and preferably all of the following modes. The versatility of operating in different modes is achieved by permitting hand vacuum cleaner  to be removed from support structure  with or without attachment member . Alternately, or in addition, further, versatility is achieved by permitting flexible hose  to be disconnectable from attachment member  and/or the cleaning head . Alternatively, or in addition, further, versatility of some examples is achieved permitting portable cleaning apparatus  to be removed form support structure  in a variety of configurations, as explained in detail below.In a first configuration, exemplified in , , ,  and , the vacuum cleaner  can be operated with the hand vacuum cleaner  mounted to the lower portion  of the floor cleaning unit . In this configuration the hand vacuum cleaner  is supported by the support structure  and the vacuum cleaner  can be operated as an upright vacuum cleaner. In this configuration, the hand vacuum cleaner  is attached to the support structure  using, e.g., an attachment member  (examples of attachment members are described in greater detail below). In some examples, a portion of the load of the hand vacuum cleaner  is optionally also supported by a mount bracket , which receives and supports another part of surface cleaning apparatus , such as optional rear wheel  of the surface cleaning apparatus .In another example of an upright operating mode, as exemplified in , the portable cleaning apparatus  is mounted to the lower portion  and is fluid communication with, and is rollingly supported by the surface cleaning head . In this configuration, or mode, the air path from the dirty air inlet  to the portable cleaning apparatus  includes the upper and lower portions , , the wand  and an optional flexible air flow conduit, for example the flexible hose . Proximate members in the air flow pathway, for example the lower end of extension wand  and the upper end of the lower portion , may be directly connectable or, as exemplified in , may be connected using a suitable, releasable coupling member, for example coupling chamber  formed in the housing of the portable cleaning apparatus , to provide the desired substantially air-tight connection. The flexible air flow conduit includes a portable portion that is removably mounted to the surface cleaning apparatus . In this example, the entire flexible hose  and upper portion  are removably connectable to the wand  and the lower portion , as explained below.In a second configuration, the surface cleaning apparatus  is operable in one or more of the following portable operating mode. In one portable operating mode, as exemplified in and , the surface cleaning apparatus  is detached from the support structure  but remains in fluid communication with the surface cleaning head  via, e.g., flexible hose  and attachment member . In this configuration, the hand vacuum cleaner  may be carried by the user (or rested on the floor or other surface) while still serving as the vacuum or suction source for the vacuum cleaner .It will be appreciated that in some examples of this portable operating mode, as exemplified in and , the air flow passage between the portable surface cleaning apparatus  and the surface cleaning head  need not be reconfigured when the hand vacuum cleaner  is removed. In other words, a hose (for example flexible hose ) need not be disconnected and then reconnected.In another example of a portable operating mode, as exemplified in , the portable cleaning apparatus  is detached from the support structure  but remains in fluid communication with the surface cleaning head , via an air flow pathway including flexible hose , upper portion , wand  and lower portion . In this example no portions of the air flow pathway need to be reconfigured when the portable cleaning apparatus  is removed. A portable portion of the flexible air flow conduit, for example flexible hose  in combination with upper portion , is connected in fluid flow communication with the extension wand  and the extension wand  is communicably connected to the surface cleaning head , for example by lower portion .Operating the surface cleaning apparatus  in this portable operating mode enables a user to remove the weight of the cleaning unit from the support structure  by separately carrying the cleaning unit (or resting it on the ground). This may allow a user to more easily maneuver the support structure  and cleaning head  around obstacles, for example furniture and stairs, on the surface being cleaned.In another example of a portable operating mode, as exemplified in ,  and , the surface cleaning apparatus  is detached from the support structure  and from fluid communication with surface cleaning head . The cleaning unit may have a nozzle and be a portable surface cleaning apparatus, such as a hand vacuum cleaner. As exemplified in , the hand vacuum cleaner  may be uncoupled from the attachment member  (which remains attached to the support structure ) and can be used independently as a portable cleaning apparatus or a hand vacuum.In another example of a portable operating mode, as exemplified in , the portable cleaning apparatus  is detached from the support structure  and the portable portion of the flexible air flow conduit, for example flexible hose  and upper portion , is detached from the extension wand . Detaching the upper portion  from the extension wand  severs the fluid communication between the portable cleaning apparatus  and the surface cleaning head . In some examples, as shown in , the portable portion of the air flow conduit can be connected to an auxiliary cleaning tool, for example crevasse tool . In other examples, as shown in , the exposed end of the upper portion  can be adapted to clean surfaces directly. Optionally, the extension wand  can remain attached to, and be moved with, the portable cleaning apparatus  in this configuration.In yet another example of a portable operating mode, as exemplified in , the portable cleaning apparatus  can be detached from the lower portion  (thereby severing the fluid communication between the portable cleaning apparatus  and the cleaning head ) and can remain fluidly connected to the extension wand . In this mode, the upper portion  remains connected to the downstream end of the extension wand  while the upstream end of the extension wand  is detached from the portable cleaning apparatus . In this configuration, a user can use the extension wand  to increase the cleaning range of the surface cleaning apparatus , as explained herein.In yet another example of a portable operating mode, as exemplified in , the surface cleaning apparatus  can be configured so that the portable portion of the flexible air flow conduit, for example the upper portion  and flexible hose , is detached from the extension wand  and is connected in fluid flow communication with the surface cleaning head . In the present example, the upper portion  can be connected directly to the lower portion , i.e. without the use of extension wand  or portions of the housing of the portable cleaning apparatus , thereby establishing an air flow pathway from the surface cleaning head  to the portable cleaning apparatus. This configuration may enable a user to closely control the movements of the surface cleaning head  in situations where the extended reach of the extension wand  is undesirable, for example when cleaning furniture surfaces or stair treads.Optionally, as exemplified in , the components of the air flow pathway of the surface cleaning apparatus  can be configured such that they are generally interconnectable. For example, the lower end of the extension wand  can be configured to connected to both the coupling chamber  of the portable cleaning apparatus  (), and the lower portion  (). Similarly, the upper portion  can be configure to be connectable to the extension wand  (), the lower portion  () and an auxiliary cleaning tool  ().Optionally, in some examples, as exemplified in , the surface cleaning apparatus  is detached from the support structure  and from fluid communication with surface cleaning head  by detaching a flexible air flow conduit, for example flexible hose  from the surface cleaning head . Accordingly, flexible hose  serves as an extended cleaning attachment for the hand vacuum cleaner . Optionally, one or both ends of flexible hose  may be disconnectable from the surface cleaning apparatus.Accordingly, if the attachment member  is coupled to the hand vacuum cleaner , and the upstream end of the air conduit  (for example hose ) is detached from the surface cleaning head , then the combination of the attachment member  and the flexible hose  (decoupled from the surface cleaning head ) may serve as an auxiliary or accessory cleaning tool. The free end of the hose  may be maneuvered by the user to clean objects and surfaces that cannot be cleaned using the surface cleaning head . In some examples, the upstream end of the flexible hose  may be connected to the auxiliary cleaning tool . Alternatively, the flexible hose  may be removed from the attachment member  and the auxiliary cleaning tool  may be mounted directly to the air inlet  of the attachment member . It will be appreciated that tool  may have a plate  and arms  provided at the coupling end thereof.Optionally, the attachment member  may be removed from the hand vacuum cleaner  and the auxiliary cleaning tool  may be fitted directly to the nozzle  (shown in ), without the use of a flexible hose  or other type intermediate air conduit. In addition to the auxiliary or accessory cleaning tool , the nozzle  may be directly connected to any one of a number of cleaning tools that have been provided with the an appropriate attachment member, including wands, brushes, crevasse tools and other hoses.Optionally, a cleaning wand  may be attached to the upstream end of the flexible hose , as exemplified in . The addition of the cleaning wand  to the end of the flexible hose  may enable a user to reach further (for example to the top of drapes or curtains) or to extend the airflow conduit  into confined spaces (for example between couch cushions or under cabinets and appliances). When assembled as shown in , the upright vacuum cleaner configuration, the dirty air travels from the cleaning head  through lower portion  (which is the up flow duct), through hose  and into mounting member .In some examples, the cleaning wand  may be shaped so that it can be received within or in air flow communication with an upper opening  of the lower portion  of the support structure , as exemplified in . In these examples, when the cleaning wand  is not in use it can be received within, and thereby stored within the lower portion  of the support structure  (not shown) or maybe mounted to upper end of lower portion  and form part of the support structure . In other examples, the cleaning wand  may be elsewhere and flexible hose  may be connected directly to upper opening .In other examples, as exemplified in , the wand  may be rigid enough to provide structural strength to the surface cleaning apparatus , and may form part of the handle/support structure . In this example the extension wand  forms part of the air flow pathway when the surface cleaning apparatus is operated in the upright operating mode, and can be selectably included in one or more of the portable operating modes, as shown in  and described in detail above.In any of the examples described above, the air conduit  (for example flexible hose  and/or wand ) may still be detachable from the surface cleaning head  even when the surface cleaning unit is not detachable from the support structure. Accordingly, some or all of air conduit may be detachable from the surface cleaning head  whether or not the hand vacuum cleaner  is detachable from the support structure  to enable a user to use the flexible hose  and/or the wand  to clean surfaces that are awkward to clean using the surface cleaning head , for example upholstery, drapes, stairs and other, non-level, confined or elevated surfaces.As exemplified in , in a preferred embodiment, the lower portion  is hollow and forms part of the airflow passage through the vacuum cleaner. Accordingly, lower portion  functions as both an air flow conduit and a support structure on which surface cleaning apparatus  is mounted. If a rigid cleaning wand  is not required, then the dirty air may travel from lower portion  directly into surface cleaning apparatus , e.g., via attachment member . Alternately, if a cleaning wand  is provided, then as exemplified, the dirty air may travel from the upper end of lower portion  into wand , into flexible hose , through optional attachment member , and then into surface cleaning apparatus .To provide the user with increased reach and cleaning range, the cleaning wand  may be more rigid than the flexible hose , and is preferably rigid, so that the cleaning wand  will maintain its generally elongate configuration (that is the upstream end of the cleaning wand being separated from but generally concentric with the downstream end of the cleaning wand), even when it is only held at one end by the user. In some instances, the cleaning wand  may be substantially rigid so that it will not deflect or bend during use. In other instances, the cleaning wand  may be more rigid than the flexible hose , but still somewhat resiliently flexible so that it can bend during use.Optionally, the upstream end of the cleaning wand  can be connected to other auxiliary or accessory cleaning tools, for example an air turbine powered brush . In some instances, the cleaning wand  may not be required and the flexible hose  may be directly connected to the brush  or other accessory or auxiliary tool. Some auxiliary cleaning tools, for example the brush  may also be described as second surface cleaning heads or auxiliary cleaning heads. In some instances, the nozzle  (described in detail below) of the hand vacuum cleaner  may also be described as a second surface cleaning head, particularly when the hand vacuum cleaner  is configured as a hand vacuum. Optionally, the cleaning wand  or any other second surface cleaning head or auxiliary tool may be connected directly to the nozzle .While in some of the examples described the cleaning unit is a portable surface cleaning apparatus  has a nozzle  that may be used to directly clean a surface, in other examples of the surface cleaning apparatus , as exemplified in , the cleaning unit is a portable cleaning apparatus  that need not have a nozzle that can directly engage a surface. In these examples, carrying the cleaning unit separate from the backbone  and surface cleaning head  may still be advantageous as it may reduce the effort required to maneuver the support structure  and surface cleaning head  by removing the weight of the cleaning unit or by permitting the surface cleaning head to be used under furniture (as exemplified in and ), and it may still allow the user to clean surfaces without the surface cleaning head  if the cleaning unit remains connected to the portable length or portion of flexible hose  or any other accessory or auxiliary cleaning device.In accordance with a third aspect, which may be used by itself or with one or more of the other aspects, the removable cleaning unit is secured in position by gravity. This may be achieved using a mount  that removably receives attachment member .Some examples of the mount  may be configured to removably receive a portion of the hand vacuum cleaner  or preferably, as exemplified, an attachment member  that may be removably coupled to the hand vacuum cleaner . Alternately, the attachment member may itself include the mount so that the attachment member may be removably attached directly to the lower portion . This may be achieved by the attachment member and the mount being an integrated assembly wherein the attachment member and the mount are not disconnectable from each other (i.e. the hand vacuum cleaner  can be removed but not with the attachment member) or the attachment member and the mount may be separable as exemplified in , whereby the hand vacuum cleaner may be removed with or without the attachment member so as to increase the versatility of the surface cleaning apparatus.The mount , as exemplified in  and -, is preferably configured to retain the hand vacuum cleaner  therein under the influence of gravity. Accordingly, a mechanical lock need not be used. In particular, a user may lift the portable surface cleaning apparatus off of upright section  without having to press a button or otherwise release a mechanical lock. The absence of mechanical fasteners allows for simple, one-handed removal of the attachment member  and the hand vacuum cleaner  from the mount , without the need to unlock or undo any fasteners. One-handed detachment of the hand vacuum cleaner  may be advantageous as it allows a user to control and maneuver the support structure  with one hand while simultaneously removing the hand vacuum cleaner  from the mount  with the other hand. In use, this may allow a user to frequently attach and detach the hand vacuum cleaner  from the mount  in response to the user's needs, for example navigating around furniture, stairs or other obstacles on the surface to be cleaned.Optionally, the mount  may be outfitted with magnets for retaining the attachment member . Magnets may assist in holding the hand vacuum cleaner on the mount and still permit one-handed removal as no fastener or lock need be manually released.Alternatively, or in addition, as exemplified in  a lock, for example a rotatable locking knob may be used to releasably secure adjustment member  and mount  together. In such an embodiment, it is preferred, as exemplified in the embodiment of , that when the lock is disengaged, hand vacuum cleaner  is still held in position by gravity. Other examples of possible fasteners include clips, snaps, and straps. Magnets may alternately or in addition be used.One example of a mount , as exemplified in , is a generally U-shaped member sized to receive collar  or other mounting portion of the complimentary attachment member . The inner surface of the mount  comprises a protrusion  that extends outward from the inner surface of the mount  and removably seats within the generally U-shaped channel  of the collar .In this example, loads placed on the mount  (via both the U-shaped opening and/or the mount bracket ) are in turn transferred via the lower portion  of the handle  to the surface cleaning head  and ultimately to the floor or other type of surface being cleaned. Another portion of the load of the hand vacuum cleaner  may be supported by an additional mounting bracket, such as mount bracket , which receives and supports optional rear wheel  of the hand vacuum cleaner . The surface of the mount bracket  may be complimentary to the curved shape of the optional rear wheel  so that the optional rear wheel  can at least partially nest within mount bracket . An upward facing protrusion  on the inner surface of the mount  seats within the channel  of the attachment member  and provides a degree of lateral support, restraining the movement of the attachment member  (and therefore the hand vacuum cleaner ) when the handle  is moved from a vertical position to an angled position when in use. Further, protrusion  may comprise a cam surface to assist in guiding protrusion  into channel  as the portable surface cleaning apparatus is lowered onto mount . In this example the attachment member  and the optional rear wheel  are preferably not held in place by clips, straps or any other type of mechanical fastening means.As exemplified, in addition to supporting the weight of the hand vacuum cleaner , the attachment member  also preferably serves as a fluid conduit establishing a fluid flow connection between the hand vacuum cleaner  and the airflow conduit , which is preferably a flexible hose . The mount  may be made from any material that can support the weight of the hand vacuum cleaner , including plastic and metal.A second example of a mount , as exemplified in  comprises more than one member configured to receive the collar portion  of attachment member . As exemplified, two support rods or ribs  are provided, each or which holds part of mount .Split saddle mount  comprises a pair of generally opposing saddle flanges  (one on each rib) that cooperate to provide a mount or a mounting location for the attachment member  that is connected to the hand vacuum cleaner . Due to the spacing of the ribs  and the general curvature of the hand vacuum cleaner , the hand vacuum cleaner  is preferably positioned in front of ribs . The attachment member  may extend rearward of hand vacuum cleaner  and may be received on split saddle flanges . Alternately, it will be appreciated that hand vacuum cleaner  may be partially nest between, or be received between, the ribs .As exemplified, to supportingly engage the attachment member , each saddle flange  preferably includes a projection or protrusion (see ) that is received within the channel  of the collar  (as described in more detail with reference to  below). The generally curved profile of the collar  and channel  may enable the attachment member  (and the associated hand vacuum cleaner ) to generally self-level or self-register between the ribs  when the user initially places the attachment member  on the saddle flanges . Optionally, the saddle flanges  may include magnets or other fastening devices to secure or retain the attachment member .Ribs  are secured in position by a connecting structure at the upper and lower end of ribs . Any such structure may be used. As exemplified in , second portion  may comprise a generally upside down U-shaped wishbone portion  to secure the upper ends of ribs  together.If used together with the first aspect, the wishbone  may be provided with a hinge  at the centre of an upper portion of the wishbone , and each prong  of the wishbone extends downward, and connects to a rib . The ribs  are preferably substantially parallel and cooperate to define a split saddle mount  for receiving the attachment member  and the hand vacuum cleaner . Optionally, the ribs  may be integrally formed with the prongs  of the wishbone portion , or they may be separate tubes or rods fastened to the prongs  of the wishbone , as shown.The lower ends of the ribs  may be attached to a bracket  having a generally opposite configuration than the wishbone. That is, the bracket may include two, upward facing projections , for attaching to the ribs , that are connected by a cross-member  to provide a single downward facing coupling point . An advantage of providing a single, downward facing coupling point may be the fact that a single coupling point can be pivotally and rotationally connected to the surface cleaning head . Another advantage is that a narrower rear end may be utilized for the surface cleaning head .The bracket  also includes a housing , which is preferably hollow, having a lower opening  that is connected in flow communication with the surface cleaning head  (e.g. by a rigid pipe as exemplified by FIGS.  and - or, by a flexible hose as exemplified in ). Housing  may be pivotally mounted to surface cleaning head, preferably at about the location of rear wheels , such as by having a portion pivotally mounted to the axle of rear wheels . Optionally, the connection between the lower opening  and the surface cleaning head  can be a rotatable and pivotal connection. The hollow housing  may extend from the lower opening , through the cross-member  to define an upper collar .A third example of a mount  and complimentary attachment member  is exemplified in FIGS.  and -, specifically . This example of the attachment member  exemplifies an attachment member  that is lockably attachable to mount .Mount  optionally comprises structural member  that has a central opening for receiving the lower portion  of the support structure . Mount  may be secured to lower portion  such as by a key, a set screw, an adhesive or other locking means. In the example illustrated the central opening of structural member  is generally annular (to receive the generally cylindrical lower portion ), while in other examples the central opening may have a different shape that is complimentary to the profile of its respective lower portion. In other examples, the mount  may be integrally formed with the lower portion .The mount  also comprises a pair of upwardly extending bosses . The bosses  may be integral with structural member  and are sized and shaped to be received within corresponding holes  in shell  of the attachment member . Once received within their corresponding holes , the bosses  serve to register the shell  on the mount  and restrain movement of the shell  relative to the mount  in the horizontal plane (when viewed with vacuum cleaner  in its upright position).Preferably, as in the example shown, each boss  is generally conical, or frusto-conical, in shape so that a proximate end of each boss  (adjacent the mount ) is wider (i.e. has a larger diameter) than the distal end of each boss  (spaced apart from the proximate end). Generally, the holes  in the shell  have a width (or diameter) that corresponds to the widest portion of the bosses , for example the base or proximate portion of the bosses  in the current example. Having a width (or diameter) of a hole that corresponds to the widest portion of each boss  enables the entire boss  to be received within its corresponding hole . Providing a narrower distal end or tip on each boss  may make it easier for a user to position the bosses  within their holes  when placing the shell  onto the mount  and may enable the surface of each boss  to act as a guiding or cam surface for guiding the shell  to its desired mounted position. In other examples, the mount  may contain a greater or fewer number of bosses  and each boss  may have any desired shape (typically corresponding to the shape of the corresponding holes ), including cubic, rectangular prism and pyramidal.In some examples the mount  also includes a coupling, locking or attachment means for securing the shell  to the mount , when the shell  is seated on the mount  (with bosses  received within corresponding holes ). As exemplified in , one example of an attachment means is locking knob  that is rotatably connected to the mount , such as on protrusion , and is secured thereto such as by a screw (not shown). The front, or outer face of the locking knob  comprises a pair of tabs  that are sized to be graspable by a user to rotate the locking know  about the protrusion . The rear, or inner face, of the locking knob  comprises a channel or groove  that is sized to receive the locking peg . Operation of the locking knob  is described below in relation to . In other examples, the attachment means may be any suitable mechanism, including clips, snaps, magnets, latches or hook and loop type fasteners. Alternatively, the mount  could be free from attachment means and the shell  could be held in place by gravity when in use.As exemplified in , the groove  is a semi-cylindrical recess formed in shell portion that is shaped to at least partially receive the lower portion  of the support structure . In other examples, the shape of the groove  may be any suitable, complimentary shape chosen to fit the lower portion of the support structure . In the example illustrated, the groove  subtends approximately 180 degrees of arc, while in other examples the groove  may subtend a larger or smaller arc, for example 200 degrees or 30 degrees. Having the lower portion  at least partially received within or nested within the groove  may increase the stability of the shell  when placed on the mount , which may reduce the lateral shear loading on bosses .Shell  also comprises a protrusion or locking peg , extending from shell . In the example illustrated, the locking peg  is located on shell portion . In other examples, the locking peg  may be located on any suitable portion of the shell  and may have any shape or profile that is complimentary to the groove  on the rear face of the locking knob .is an illustration of the attachment member  when the shell , supporting the hand vacuum cleaner , is slightly separated from the mount , for example when the shell  is in the process of being placed on, or removed from, the mount . As shown in this figure, the lower portion  is partially received within the groove  which may serve to stabilize the shell  and may also serve as a locating or positioning means, which may help a user to horizontally align the holes  in the shell  with the bosses  on the mount . When the shell  is spaced apart from the mount  the knob  is rotated to its open or unlocked position, as shown.When the shell  is lowered onto the mount , as shown in , the shell  (and hand vacuum cleaner ) are supported by an upper face of the mount  and the bosses . The locking knob  is rotated to the unlocked position.As shown in , to secure the shell  to the mount , the knob  is rotated into its closed or locked position (clockwise as illustrated in ), thereby retaining locking peg  and restraining vertical movement of the shell  relative to the mount . As described above, horizontal movement (i.e. in the horizontal plane) of the shell  relative to the mount  is restrained by the combination of the groove  and the bosses  received in holes . Accordingly, with the knob  in the locked position (as shown in ) the shell  is fixed relative to the mount .In operation, the cleaning unit may be lifted vertically off of attachment member  if the lock is engaged. If the lock is not engaged, then the attachment member may be lifted off of the mount  and the cleaning unit removed while still in air flow communication with hose .In some examples of the surface cleaning apparatus , the mount  may be located in a variety of locations along the length of the second portion . Preferably, the mount  is positioned at approximately the waist height of the intended user (e.g., 2.5-3.5 feet above the floor) so that the user can attached or detach the hand vacuum cleaner  from the support structure  without bending over. This may decrease the stress and strain experienced by the user when the user removes the hand vacuum cleaner  from the support structure .In other examples, as exemplified in , the portable cleaning apparatus  can be removably mounted on the lower portion  of the handle . In such examples, the mount apparatus can be a segment of the lower portion , for example segment , that is configured to be received within a corresponding slot or aperture in the portable cleaning apparatus , for example a portion of the coupling chamber . The portable cleaning apparatus  is configured so that it can be stably supported on the lower portion , with or without the use a locking mechanism. In the present example, the coupling is such the segment is received sufficiently far within the coupling chamber  of the portable cleaning apparatus  that the coupling can support/resist both shear and bending loads. To remove the portable cleaning apparatus  from the support structure , a used can lift the portable cleaning apparatus  relative to the lower portion  until the segment is clear from the coupling chamber .The surface cleaning head  serves as a base portion of the vacuum cleaner  and is preferably in rolling contact with the surface to be cleaned. When the vacuum cleaner is  in an upright position (as exemplified in , , , , , , , - and ) the surface cleaning head  is supported by optional main or rear wheels  and/or optional front wheels (not shown). Any surface cleaning head may be used.In some examples, as exemplified in , the vacuum cleaner  may comprise an additional support wheel  that is provided on the support structure  to provide additional rolling support when the vacuum cleaner  is moved into an angled position during use. In other examples, the surface cleaning head  may include a greater or fewer number of wheels. Preferably, lower portion  is rotatably mounted to the cleaning head. Accordingly, a user may rotate grip  clockwise or counterclockwise to assist in steering the cleaning head.The surface cleaning head  also comprises a dirty air inlet  that is connected in fluid communication with a dirty air outlet  by one or more dirty air conduits (not shown). Preferably, the dirty air inlet is an air flow chamber wherein at least a portion of the lower side is open.The dirty air outlet  may be coupled, optionally removably coupled, to the upstream end of the conduit, preferably via a flexible hose , that extends from the dirty air outlet  of the surface cleaning head  to the upright section, such as the attachment member air inlet . The fluid pathway may continue through the attachment member passageway , which terminates in attachment member air outlet , and through attachment member air outlet  which mates with the opening  of the portable cleaning apparatus .In some examples, as exemplified in , the surface cleaning head  includes a hollow conduit member  and a second air conduit . As exemplified in , one example of the second air conduit  is a second flexible hose . In the preferred arrangement shown, the dirty air outlet  of the surface cleaning head  is connected to the second or upstream flexible hose  and the second flexible hose  extends from the dirty air outlet , through the hollow conduit member , through the hollow housing  to the upper collar . The downstream end of the second flexible hose  may be fixedly connected to the upper collar , or it may have a fitting that seats upon a surface of the upper collar  preventing the second flexible hose  from retracting within the hollow housing  while leaving the downstream end of the second flexible hose  free to extend upward, away from the upper collar .The second flexible hose  forms part of the continuous airflow passageway that connects the dirty air outlet  of the surface cleaning head  to the opening  on the hand vacuum cleaner . In accordance with a fourth aspect that may be used by itself or with any other aspect, to establish the continuous airflow passageway, the downstream end of the second upstream flexible hose  may be connected to the upstream end of the downstream flexible hose . The connection between the flexible hose  and the downstream end of the second flexible hose  is preferably a detachable connection so that the flexible hose  can be detached from the surface cleaning head  as described above.Optionally, in a fifth aspect, which may be used by itself or with any one or more other aspects, the second flexible hose  is also an extensible, or stretchable, hose that can extend when pulled on by the user. In some examples, the second flexible hose  is a stretch hose and may have a stretched length to non-stretched length ratio of between 2:1-6:1. In examples where the second flexible hose  is not stretchable, when a user removes the hand vacuum cleaner  from its mount during use, the maximum distance that the hand vacuum cleaner  can be separated from the support structure  and the surface cleaning head  is determined by the length of the flexible hose . However, in some instances, a user may wish to move the hand vacuum cleaner  a greater distance from the support structure , for example to pass the surface cleaning head  under a bed or other large piece of furniture. When a stretchable second flexible hose  is used, the downstream end of the second flexible hose  can unseat from the upper collar  and extend away from the bracket , whereby some of hose  may pass through housing  thereby lengthening the airflow conduit connecting the hand vacuum cleaner  to the surface cleaning head  and allowing the hand vacuum cleaner  to be moved further from the support structure  in use. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that some or all of the conduit that may be extended to provide additional length for an air flow passage may be stored on the surface cleaning head .It will be appreciated that lower section  may be rotatably mounted on cleaning head  without hose  extending through a housing . Further, a housing  may be used even if lower section  is not rotatably mounted to cleaning head . Such a housing need not be pivotally mounted to surface cleaning head.Preferably, the second flexible hose  is also resilient so that it will return to its original, un-stretched length when it is released by the user. The resilience of the second flexible hose  may tend to retract the second flexible hose  through the hollow housing  and the hollow conduit member  and may serve to re-seat the downstream end of the second flexible hose  on the upper collar . In this example, the second flexible hose  functions as a variable length air conduit and may reduce the need for a user to add extra hoses or conduit members to the vacuum  during use.To allow for easy and repeated extension of the second flexible hose , the second flexible hose  may be sized to freely pass through both the hollow conduit member  of the surface cleaning head  and the hollow housing  of the bracket .In the example shown in , the hollow housing  is integral the bracket  and also serves as the coupling means that connects the lower portion  to the surface cleaning head . As shown, the coupling between the lower portion  and the surface cleaning head  may be the telescoping or overlapping engagement of the lower opening  over the surface cleaning head  hollow conduit member . In other examples, the coupling or attachment between the lower portion  and the surface cleaning head  may be any type of connection including a threaded connection, clamps or tabs. The connection between the lower portion  and the surface cleaning head  may be fixed or selectively releasable. An advantage of providing a single, downward facing coupling point  may be the fact that a single coupling point  can be pivotally and rotationally connected to the surface cleaning head . Further, the hollow conduit member  may be pivotally connected to the surface cleaning head , as exemplified in FIGS. -, and in other examples, the hollow conduit member  may be fixedly connected to the surface cleaning head , or integrally formed therewith.As shown, the hollow housing  may be integral with the bracket  and provide both a hollow passageway and an attachment point. However, in other examples, the hollow housing  may be external the bracket  and may be formed from a separate conduit. Similarly, the air flow conduit  connecting the attachment member  to the second flexible hose  may be the flexible hose  or any other suitable conduit, including flexible conduits, rigid conduits, conduits integral with the handle and conduits external the handle.Optionally, the ribs  (or another portion of the second portion ) may be surrounded by a housing or shell. The housing may provide structural strength to the second portion  or it may merely provide an improved aesthetic appearance of the vacuum , or both. If a housing is formed around a section of the second portion  (or any other section of the handle  or support structure ) the mount for supporting the hand vacuum (for example the mount  or the saddle flanges ) may be within a recess in the housing. Providing a recess in the housing for receiving the hand vacuum may create a more integrated or seamless visual appearance when the hand vacuum is mounted to the support structure ; it may also improve the rigidity of the support structure .In a sixth aspect, which may be used by itself or with any one or more other aspects when the cleaning unit, for example hand vacuum cleaner , is mounted to the backbone, the centre of gravity of the backbone and hand vacuum cleaner  combined is preferably below a plane P extending from the axle of rear wheel  to the upper end of upper portion  (as exemplified in ), thereby improving maneuverability of surface cleaning head . As exemplified, this may be achieved by wishbone portion  extending forwardly to provide a mount for upper portion  (i.e. the handle) at a forward point of the backbone and passageway  extending rearwardly. It will be appreciated that other constructions, such as those exemplified in  or FIGS.  and -, may be used to position the centre of gravity behind the plane. For example, as best shown in , one example of the lower portion  includes an upper end that is connected to the hinge  such that the upper portion  is drivingly connected to the surface cleaning head . In this construction the lower end includes a step-back or kinked-back portion . The step-back portion  enables the mount  to be positioned sufficiently behind the rear wheels  such that the centre of gravity of the combination of the support structure  and the hand vacuum cleaner  is below the plane P. As a result of this configuration, the surface cleaning apparatus  may be more stable when rotated and maneuvered by the user, especially when upper portion  is rotated about hinge . Specifically, locating the centre of gravity of the combination of the hand vacuum cleaner  and the support structure  below the plane P may tend to reduce the over rotation of the support structure  or over-steer of the vacuum  in use, and may reduce the strain on a user's arm and wrist.It will be appreciated that the dual hose construction (i.e. the flexible hose  and the second flexible hose  of ) may be used in combination with any example disclosed herein or by itself in a surface cleaning apparatus. Similarly, the positioning of a removably mounted portable surface cleaning apparatus with a low centre of gravity may be used in combination with any example disclosed herein or by itself in a surface cleaning apparatus.Preferably, the cleaning unit is a portable surface cleaning apparatus, and more preferably a hand vacuum cleaner, wherein the portable surface cleaning apparatus optionally has a nozzle having an open sided air flow chamber. It will be appreciated that the cleaning unit may be of any construction and may use any particular air treatment member (e.g., one or more cyclones comprising one or more cyclonic cleaning stages and/or one or more filters). Further, the cleaning unit may alternately, or in addition, selectively receive an auxiliary cleaning tool.Referring now to , examples a hand vacuum cleaner  and the attachment member  of the vacuum  are shown in more detail.In some examples, the surface cleaning unit can be a hand vacuum cleaner  that can be operated as the vacuum suction supply for the vacuum  and it can be operated as a stand alone hand vacuum cleaner, that is movable along a surface to be cleaned by gripping and maneuvering handle , when it is removed from, or detached from the support structure . The hand vacuum cleaner  includes an upper portion , a lower portion , a front , and a rear . In the example shown, maneuvering handle  is provided at the upper portion . In alternate examples, maneuvering handle  may be provided elsewhere on the vacuum cleaner , for example at the rear .In the example shown, the hand vacuum cleaner  comprises a nozzle  and a cyclone unit , which together preferably form a cleaning head portion  of the hand vacuum cleaner . In the example shown, the cleaning head portion  is provided at the front  of the hand vacuum cleaner .Nozzle  comprises a dirty air inlet , through which dirty air is drawn into the portable cleaning apparatus , and when used as a hand vacuum cleaner the nozzle  directly engages a surface to be cleaned. An airflow passage extends from the dirty air inlet  to a clean air outlet  of the hand vacuum cleaner . In the example shown, clean air outlet  is at the rear  of the hand vacuum cleaner . It will be appreciated that clean air outlet may optionally be connected to a fluid conduit provided in the floor cleaning unit.Cyclone unit  is provided in the airflow passage, downstream of the dirty air inlet . In the example shown, the cyclone unit  comprises one cyclone , and one dirt chamber . In alternate examples, the cyclone unit  may include more than one cyclone, and more than one dirt chamber. Further, the cyclones may be arranged in stages, and may be provided in parallel or in sequence. Alternately, or in addition, one or more filters or other dirt separation members may be used.In the example shown, the nozzle  is positioned at the lower portion  of the portable cleaning apparatus . More preferably, as in the example shown, nozzle  is positioned at the bottom of the portable cleaning apparatus , and is preferably beneath the cyclone unit  when used as a hand vacuum cleaner and is between the cyclone unit  and the mount  when attached to the support structure . Further, as in the example shown, the nozzle  is preferably fixedly positioned at the lower portion  of the portable cleaning apparatus . That is, the nozzle  is not movable with respect to the remainder of the portable cleaning apparatus , and is fixed at the lower portion  of the portable cleaning apparatus . As shown in , nozzle  has a width Wand, as shown in , coupling plate  has a width Wthat is generally the same as width W.Nozzle  exemplifies a particular design for an open sided nozzle. Open sided nozzle  has an open side that faces the surface to be cleaned when the nozzle is placed against a surface to be cleaned. Accordingly, nozzle  defines an air flow chamber that has an open lower side. In operation, air will flow longitudinally through the air flow chamber to an air exit. It will be appreciated that only part of the nozzle may have an open lower side. Alternately, all of the nozzle, from an air inlet end to the air outlet, may have an open lower side. It will be appreciated that various other design may be used. An advantage of using an open sided nozzle is that the nozzle may be the member that is used to mount hand vacuum cleaner  to mounting member .Referring now to , nozzle  comprises an upper nozzle wall . In the example shown, the upper nozzle wall  comprises a portion  of a wall  of the cyclone unit. Nozzle  further preferably comprises a depending wall  extending downwardly from the upper nozzle wall . The depending wall  is generally U-shaped. The height of the depending wall may vary. The open end of the U-shape defines an open side wall  of the nozzle , and forms the dirty air inlet  of the portable cleaning apparatus . In the example shown, the open side wall  is provided at the front of the nozzle  and forms a portion of a flow passage that is in communication with the opening . When in use as a hand vacuum, optional wheels  are in contact with a surface and the open side wall  sits above and is adjacent a hard surface to be cleaned. It will be appreciated that depending wall  may be positioned only rearward of opening . Alternately, or in addition, depending wall  may be provided adjacent the lateral sides of opening . The depending walls may be discrete walls or they may be joined together as exemplified. The walls may be continuous or discontinuous.In the example shown, the lower end  of the depending wall  defines an open lower end  of the nozzle . The open lower end  extends to the front  of the hand vacuum cleaner , and merges with the open side . In use, the open lower end  faces a surface to be cleaned. In the example shown, a plurality of wheels  are mounted to the depending wall , and extend below the lower end  of the depending wall . Accordingly, when in use as a hand vacuum, when wheels  are in contact with a surface, the lower end  of the depending wall  is spaced from a surface to be cleaned, and the space between the lower end of the depending wall  and the surface to be cleaned form a secondary dirty air inlet to the portable cleaning apparatus  when used as a hand vacuum.The upper nozzle wall , depending wall , and open lower end  of the nozzle  define an airflow chamber  of the nozzle. An opening  is preferably provided in the upper nozzle wall , and is in communication with the airflow chamber . When in use as a hand vacuum, the wheels  are in contact with a surface, the opening  faces a surface to be cleaned, air enters the dirty air inlet , passes horizontally through the airflow chamber , and passes into the opening . Opening  is in communication with a cyclone inlet passage , which is in communication with a cyclone air inlet  of cyclone . In some embodiments, opening  need not be in upper wall .Nozzle  and attachment member  are configured such that attachment member  may form part of the air flow conduit to opening  when attachment member  is mounted to hand vacuum cleaner . For example, when the portable cleaning apparatus  is used in combination with the support structure  and the surface cleaning head , the opening  in the nozzle  is in sealed, fluid communication with the air outlet  of the attachment member . By way of this connection, a continuous fluid pathway is established between the dirty air input  of the surface cleaning head  and the opening .It will be appreciated that examples of the attachment member  may be removably mounted to nozzle  by any engagement means known in the connecting arts. For example, pivoting arms may be used, see for example , or sliding engagement may be used, see for example . Further, attachment member  may be of any configuration. Attachment member  may be part of, or may be connected to, an accessory cleaning tool by any means, such as a flexible hose. The flexible hose may be hose  if hose  is removably mounted to the floor cleaning unit.As exemplified in , one example of the attachment member  is removably engaged with nozzle  by the engagement of pivoting arms in slots provided on nozzle . Accordingly, for example, nozzle  may also include a slot  defining a recess in the depending wall  that is adjacent the upper nozzle wall . The slot  preferably extends continuously along the U-shaped portion of the nozzle depending wall  and may be bounded at each end by corners . The attachment member  includes two arms  each having a shoulder  and being pivotally connected to the coupling plate  using pins  (alternatively, the arms  could be resilient).  is a partially exploded view of the attachment member , illustrating one example of the rotational connection between the coupling  and the collar . In the example shown, the coupling  comprises a cylindrical body wall that passes through an opening in the collar . Once the coupling  had been inserted into the collar  it is retained using fastening clip . The combination of the coupling plate  and the arms  may also be described as connecting portion, mounting portion or nozzle mounting portion of the attachment member .In order to assemble the mount on nozzle , coupling plate  may be slid into the open end of airflow chamber . Accordingly, when the coupling plate  of the attachment member  is slid into the airflow chamber , the arms  are pressed together by the nozzle  walls until the point when arms  are aligned with slot  (i.e. when the shoulders  are advanced past the corners ). When the arms  are aligned with the slot , the attachment member  is “clicked-in” or locked in place when the arms  spread apart and the shoulders  of the arms  become lodged behind the corners  of slot . The arms  may be manually separated or the attachment member may include a biasing means (not shown) that biases the arms  apart. With the arms  in the spread configuration the attachment member  cannot be slidingly removed from the nozzle . When a user wishes to detach the attachment means  from the nozzle  the user may squeeze upstanding tabs  together thereby allowing the shoulders  to slide past the corners . The mount may alternately be inserted by squeezing upstanding tabs  together so that plate  may be inserted in chamber .When the hand vacuum cleaner  is coupled to the attachment member  the airflow chamber  may receive, and be partially filled with the coupling plate  (as exemplified in , -,  or -) of the attachment member . The coupling plate  is preferably shaped to be slidingly received within the airflow chamber .Insertion of the coupling plate  into the airflow chamber  serves to register the air outlet  with the nozzle opening . As shown, the air outlet  has a width Wand a length Lthat are preferably the same as the width Wand a length Lof the opening . A sealing gasket  may provided at the juncture of the openings.The attachment member  and the nozzle  may alternately, or in addition also include a plurality of magnets  that magnetically couple the attachment member  to the nozzle  to improve the connection between them and ensure that air outlet  is properly registered with opening . It will be appreciated that, in an alternate embodiment, only magnets maybe used. Other mounting means may be used. For example, a plurality of latches may be used or air outlet  may extend into opening .As exemplified in , the cleaning unit may be secured in position by sliding engagement. As exemplified, a coupling plate  is configured to be slidingly received within a portion of the nozzle of the surface cleaning apparatus, and is sized so that the air outlet  is registered with the air inlet of the hand vacuum cleaner  when coupled. As exemplified, hand vacuum cleaner  may be held on the coupling plate  using only gravitational forces once it is slid into position.Clean air outlet  is provided downstream of the cyclone unit , suction motor and optional post-motor filter contained optionally within the cleaner body . Clean air outlet  may comprise a plurality of apertures formed in housing . The cleaner body  may also contain one or more of a separation plate, a dirt chamber, a pre-motor filter and a plurality of connecting fluid conduits or passageways.In the examples shown, cleaner body  is removably mounted to head portion . For example, cleaner body  may be entirely removable from head portion , or pivotally mounted to head portion . Accordingly, cleaner body  and head portion  may be separated in order to provide access to the interior of cleaner body  or head portion . This may allow a pre-motor filter to be cleaned, changed, or serviced, or the motor to be cleaned, changed or serviced. Alternately, head portion  may be cleaned or serviced. For example, any dirt stuck in the enclosed passages portable cleaning apparatus  may be removed. Alternately, a replacement cleaner body  or head portion  may be provided, and may be mounted to an existing head portion  or cleaner body , respectively.One or more additional rear wheels  may be mounted to housing  at lower portion , and may be used in conjunction with wheels  when the portable cleaning apparatus  is used as a hand vacuum. When the portable cleaning apparatus  is attached to the support structure  the additional wheel  preferably engages with the mount bracket  and partially supports the portable cleaning apparatus  on the handle  as described above.Preferably, as exemplified in , in accordance with a seventh aspect that may be used by itself or with one or more other aspects, the portion of the attachment member  that is used to mount the attachment member to the backbone may also comprise part of the air flow path from surface cleaning head  to hand vacuum cleaner . For example, as exemplified in , the attachment member  may include a mounting portion or collar  that includes a coupling  and defines a channel . The collar  is connected to the airflow passageway , or alternatively may be connected directly to the air conduit . Optionally, the coupling  is a rotatable coupling that allows the airflow passageway  to rotate relative to the collar .In another example, as exemplified in , the attachment member  comprises a shell  having two complimentary shell portions and , which cooperate to define the outer surfaces of the shell . Shell portion comprises a coupling  for joining the attachment member airflow passage way  to the shell  and a groove  for receiving a portion of the lower portion .The coupling  may be any type of suitable coupling including a rigid coupling, a fixed coupling, a releasable coupling and a rotatable coupling. The coupling  comprises a central opening or aperture that forms part of the continuous airflow conduit or passage way between the air inlet  and the air outlet  formed in coupling plate  (which, in the example illustrated is formed from complimentary portions , and internal members ). The coupling  and the air outlet  are connected in fluid communication by internal shell conduit (shown comprising two portions, but optionally formed from more than two portions or a single member). Therefore, in the present example, as best illustrated in , dirty air from the surface cleaning head  travels into air inlet , through airflow passageway , through shell portion , through internal shell conduit and exits via air outlet  formed through shell portion  and the integral coupling plate . In the example shown, airflow passageway  is connected to flexible hose  using an annular insert  that comprises clips . In other examples, the clips  may be integral the airflow passageway .The upstream end of the airflow passageway  defines the air inlet . In operation, the air inlet  is preferably coupled to the airflow conduit  that extends to the surface cleaning head  (the flexible air hose  in the example shown). As exemplified in , the air inlet  is releasably coupled to the flexible air hose by clips . Downstream of the coupling  an enclosed airflow passage connects the airflow passage  to the air outlet . It will be appreciated that the attachment member  need not comprise part of the air flow passage. For example, coupling  may be located out of the flow path defined by passageway . Alternately, plate  need not have opening . Accordingly, attachment member may have a first part that is secured to hand vacuum cleaner  and a second distinct part that completes that air flow passage from surface cleaning head  to opening .The airflow passageway  may be flexible or rigid and may be generally straight or may have a curved shape, as shown. Preferably, the curved airflow passageway  subtends fewer than 45 degrees.It will be appreciated that the removable cleaning unit or hand vacuum cleaner and the bendable wand may be used by themselves or with any other feature disclosed herein. In addition, any of the features disclosed herein may be used by themselves, or with any other feature, and may include the removable surface cleaning unit and the bendable wand. It will be appreciated that the removable surface cleaning unit may comprise the operating components of the surface cleaning apparatus (the motor and cyclones/filters) or only some of them and is preferably capable of being used as a self contained portable cleaning apparatus if removed from physical contact with and air flow communication with the upright vacuum cleaner.What has been described above has been intended to be illustrative of the invention and non-limiting and it will be understood by persons skilled in the art that other variants and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the claims appended hereto."

The fastener driver  may have any configuration. In the illustrated embodiment, the fastener driver  includes a piston  and a drive rod  that is connected to the piston . A seal  is provided between the piston  and an interior wall of the cylinder  so as to form a slidable seal. This allows pressure on one side of the piston  to be different from pressure on the other side of the piston  so that a pressure differential may effect movement of the piston . The drive rod  may be connected to the piston  by any suitable fastening technique, such as a threaded or a welded connection. The illustrated embodiment is not intended to be limiting in any way. The drive rod  may have a substantially circular cross-section, or the drive rod  may have a cross-section that is D-shaped, or is shaped as a crescent, as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.The engine  also includes a head valve , partially shown in  that is disposed above the cylinder . The head valve  is constructed and arranged to substantially seal the top of the cylinder  from the reservoir  when the head valve  is in a closed position, and move away from the cylinder  when the head valve  is moved to an open position. A spring (not shown) is disposed between the head valve  and the cap  such that the head valve  is biased to the closed position when there is no pressurized gas in the device  or when the pressurized gas applies equal force on both sides of the head valve . The head valve  is constructed and arranged to be actuated so as to allow the pressurized gas that is in the reservoir  to enter the cylinder  and move the fastener driver  through an operating cycle. Each cycle includes a drive stroke in which the driver  moves along a drive axis DA and drives the leading fastener into the workpiece, and a return stroke in which the driver  is returned to its initial position so that it is ready for another drive stroke.The device  also includes an actuator  that is constructed and arranged to actuate the head valve , and, hence, initiate the drive stroke. The actuator  includes a trigger valve  and a contact arm  that interacts with the trigger valve  through a mechanical linkage. The trigger valve  is constructed and arranged to allow passage of the pressurized gas from the reservoir  to a chamber above the head valve  through a passageway (not shown), and to selectively allow passage of gas from the chamber through an exhaust opening in the trigger valve .The trigger valve  may be moved to the actuated position by pressing a valve stem  against the force applied on the valve stem  by the pressurized gas, and the bias of a spring  that is disposed within the trigger valve . This may be done with the user's finger, or can be done with a trigger  that is rotatably mounted to the housing . Triggers that have linear movement rather then rotational movement are also contemplated. When the trigger  is rotated toward the valve stem  while the contact arm  is depressed against the workpiece, the trigger  engages the valve stem  and presses the valve stem  against the bias of the spring . When the trigger valve  is actuated, i.e. when the valve stem  is moved against the bias of the spring  and the pressurized gas, the passageway within the trigger valve  between the chamber above the head valve  and the exhaust opening is opened, and the pressurized gas in the chamber is now able to flow through the trigger valve and out the exhaust opening.Actuation of the head valve , or movement of the head valve  to the open position, will depend on whether the pressurized gas from the chamber above the head valve  is exhausted to atmosphere through the trigger valve . Once the pressurized gas from the chamber starts to be exhausted, the pressure within the chamber drops. This pressure drop, when high enough, allows the head valve  to move to the open position due to the force being exerted on the head valve  by the pressurized gas within the reservoir , which is at a greater pressure. Additional details of suitable engines and actuators for the fastener driving device  may be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,134,586, 7,143,918, and 7,677,426, the entire contents which are incorporated herein by reference.As illustrated in , the fastener driving device  also includes a dust blower . The dust blower  is configured to allow pressurized gas in the reservoir  to be selectively communicated to atmosphere, as discussed in further detail below. In one embodiment, the dust blower  includes a passageway  that extends from the reservoir  to an outlet  in the engine receiving portion  of the housing , and an actuator  that is configured to selectively open and close the passageway . When the passageway  is open, gas in the reservoir  is communicated from the reservoir ′ to the outlet  through the actuator  and the passageway . When the passageway  is closed, the gas is not communicated from the reservoir  to the outlet .As illustrated in , the passageway  at least partially circumnavigates the cylinder  of the drive engine . The passageway  may be defined by a gap between an outer surface  of the cylinder  and an inner surface  of the engine receiving portion  of the housing . In the illustrated embodiment, the outer surface  of the cylinder  may define a recess  or groove (see ) that partially defines the passageway . In an alternative embodiment (not shown), the inner surface  of the engine receiving portion  of the housing  may define a recess or groove that partially defines the passageway . The illustrated embodiment is not intended to be limiting in any way.The passageway  is connected to the outlet  via a second passageway  that extends perpendicularly from the passageway  and substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cylinder, as illustrated in . As illustrated, a tube  having an inner lumen  is placed between the cylinder  and the engine receiving portion  of the housing  to define the second passageway . The diameter of the inner lumen  may be sized so that second passageway  may amplify or reduce the pressure of the gas entering the second passageway  so that the desired pressure of gas is delivered to the outlet . In an embodiment, the second passageway  may be entirely defined by the engine receiving portion  of the housing , or may be entirely defined by the cylinder , or may be defined by various surfaces of the engine receiving portion  of the housing  and the cylinder  in a similar manner that the passageway  is defined. The illustrated embodiment is not intended to be limiting in any way.As can be appreciated from , the outlet  comprises an opening in the housing  positioned near the nose assembly . The outlet  is configured to direct at least a portion of the gas exiting the second passageway  generally in the same direction (e.g., from 0° to about 45° relative to the drive axis DA) that the fastener is driven out of the fastener driving device when the device is in use. The outlet  may have any suitable shape that allows the gas to exit the dust blower  in the desired direction and at the desired pressure. In the illustrated embodiment, the outlet  has an elongated shape that allows the flow of the gas to fan out across a width, as shown in . In an embodiment, the outlet  may have a circular shape that allows the flow of the gas to be more directed and concentrated than the flow of gas exiting an outlet having an elongated shape. In one embodiment, at least a portion of the gas is directed in a direction that is parallel to (i.e. at an angle of 0° relative to) the drive track axis. In another embodiment, the gas is directed generally at an angle of less that 30° relative to the drive track axis. In another embodiment, the gas may fan out at an angle; and in one embodiment, the included angle is 60° or less. In one embodiment, the included angle is 30° or less. In one embodiment; the included angle is bisected by a line that is generally parallel to the drive axis DA. The illustrated embodiment is not intended to be limiting in any way. For example, in an alternative embodiment, an adjustable nozzle may be positioned in the outlet  so that the precise direction of the pressurized gas that exits the outlet may be changed based on the user's preference.As illustrated in , the housing  of the fastener driving device  includes an elongated chamber  that extends through the housing  and is configured to receive the actuator  of the dust blower , as discussed in further detail below. Although the elongated chamber  is illustrated as being in the handle portion  of the housing , the elongated chamber  may be located in the engine receiving portion  of the housing . In an embodiment, the elongated chamber  may not extend entirely through the housing , but instead may be capped off at one end by the housing . The elongated chamber  generally includes a first portion having a surface defined by a first diameter and a second portion having a surface defined by a second diameter that is greater than the first diameter. The elongated chamber  also includes a transition surface in between the surface that defines the first portion and the surface that defines the second portion . The first portion of the elongated chamber  is in fluid communication with the passageway , as illustrated in , and the second portion is in fluid communication with the reservoir  via a third passageway  that is located between the reservoir  and the elongated chamber , as generally illustrated in .The actuator  includes a manually engageable portion , an elongated member  that is operatively connected to the manually engageable portion , and a pair of seals  spaced apart along the elongated member . The manually engageable portion  may be in the form of a push button that is configured to be pushed by a user's thumb or finger, as illustrated in the Figures, and may be attached to one end of the elongated member . Any suitable means for attaching the push button to the elongated member  may be used, such as a press fit, an adhesive, etc. In another embodiment, the manually engageable portion  may be in the form of a rotatable switch or a slide, or any other suitable structure that is configured to allow the user to actuate the actuator . The illustrated embodiment is not intended to be limiting in any way.The elongated member  generally includes a first portion  configured to be received by the first portion of the elongated chamber , and a second portion  configured to be received by the second portion of the elongated chamber . As illustrated, the first portion  has section that has a smaller diameter than the second portion  and is located between the pair of seals . The seals , which may be o-rings, are configured to engage the inner surface that defines the first portion of the elongated chamber  when the elongated member  is positioned within the chamber  and provide a seal between the first portion of the elongated chamber  and the first portion  of the elongated member  when the elongated member  is in a first position, as illustrated in .The actuator  also includes an end cap  and a biasing member , which may be a spring, for example a coil spring, that is positioned between the elongated member  and the end cap . The biasing member  is configured to bias the elongated member  in the first position, as discussed in further detail below. Any suitable biasing member may be used to bias the elongated member . The illustrated embodiment is not intended to be limiting in any way. The end cap  may be a set screw that is screwed into the housing , as illustrated in , and configured to seal the elongated chamber  at one end thereof.When the elongated member  is in the first position, as illustrated in , the second portion  of the elongated member  is positioned against the transition surface so that second portion of the elongated chamber  is sealed from the first portion of the elongated chamber , which prevents pressurized gas from being communicated from the reservoir  to the passageway  via the chamber . When the elongated member  is in a second position, as illustrated in , the first portion  of the elongated member  is partially positioned within the second portion of the elongated chamber , which allows the pressurized gas from the reservoir  to pass through elongated chamber , through the passageway , and out the outlet , as generally illustrated in .To actuate the dust blower  by moving the elongated member  from the first position to the second position, the user may use a thumb (or finger) to press the manually engageable portion  of the actuator  towards the housing  and against the bias of the bias member , which opens a fluid flow path between the reservoir  and the outlet , as described above. To stop the flow of the pressurized gas from the reservoir  to the outlet , the user may take the thumb (or finger) off of the manually engageable portion  so that the biasing member  may move the elongated member  from the second position back to the first position, which will stop the flow of the pressurized gas from the reservoir to the outlet .In the illustrated embodiment, the manually engageable portion  of the actuator  is located near the trigger  of the fastener driving device , as illustrated in , which may allow the user to grasp the handle  and operate the dust blower  and the trigger  without having to regrasp the fastener driving device . For example, four fingers of the user may grasp the handle  while the thumb is used to push the manually engageable portion . In an alternative arrangement (not shown), the manually engageable portion can be placed so that it is more convenient for the user's trigger finger or index finger to actuate the manually engageable portion  while the other fingers grasp the handle . The location of the outlet  of the dust blower  may allow the user to quickly blow off dust from the workpiece and position the fastener driving device on the workpiece in an operative position with minimal movement of the fastener driving device . In operation, the user may clear dust from the workpiece by using a thumb (or finger) to operate the dust blower , as described above, before or as the fastener driving device  is being positioned at the desired location on the workpiece, and then actuate the trigger valve  via the trigger  after the fastener driving device  is positioned at the desired location on the workpiece and the contact arm  is depressed against the workpiece.While specific embodiments of the invention have been described above, it will be appreciated that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as described. The descriptions above are intended to be illustrative, not limiting. Thus, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that modifications may be made to the invention as described without departing from the scope of the claims set out below."

                "The invention relates to a vacuum cleaner comprising a housing being separated in at least a dust compartment and a motor compartment, the vacuum cleaner also comprises a motor located in the motor compartment and an air guide between the dust compartment and the motor.By such kind of device the motor is suspended in a separation wall between the dust compartment and the motor compartment by means of a rubber mounting packing which covers and fixes the outer contour of the motor to the separation wall. The rubber mounting packing also forms the air guide.Although it is intended by the known vacuum cleaner from the previous paragraph to obtain isolation of vibration of the motor and thereby reduce the phenomenon of shaking of the housing and the thereby produced vibration noise, by the known vacuum cleaner dynamic forces and the vibrations induced by these forces will still be transmitted by the rubber mounting packing to the housing via the separation wall due to a relatively high amount of damping.It is an object of the invention to provide a vacuum cleaner whereby an improved isolation of the vibration of the motor is being obtained.This object is being achieved by the vacuum cleaner according to the invention in that the motor is suspended in the motor compartment by a suspension system comprising at least one spring, whereby the natural frequency of the suspension system including the motor is at least 3 times lower than the excitation frequency of the motor whilst the spring has a damping less than 1%, the values for the suspension system being valid in all six degrees of freedom of displacement.The natural frequency is the frequency in which the suspension system and the motor will oscillate about a resting position when this system has been moved from its resting position if there are no disturbing forces.The excitation frequency of the motor is the frequency in which the suspension system and the motor will oscillate when the motor is running.A damping of less than 1% is a damping whereby the actual damping is 1% of the critical damping of the suspension system.The values for the suspension system are preferably valid in all six degrees of freedom of displacement so translation along x, y and z axis and rotation about these axis.The damping is preferably less than 1% but more preferably less than 0,5% and even more preferably less then 0,1%.With such a low damping of the spring and the relatively low natural frequency of the suspension system nearly no dynamic forces and vibrations induced by these forces will be transmitted from the motor to the housing. These values can easily be obtained from a transfer function of the suspension system including the motor.The rubber mounting packing of the known device has a damping of approximately more than 4%.One embodiment of the vacuum cleaner according to the invention is characterized in that at least one spring has a stiffness at least ten times higher than the stiffness of the flexible air guide.Since the air guide is flexible and has a stiffness much lower than the stiffness of the spring the air guide will not influence the vibration isolation of the suspension of the motor by means of the spring. By being flexible the air guide is suitable for providing a leakage free sealing between the dust compartment and the motor compartment, whilst the motor is allowed to move with respect to the dust compartment.The suspension of the motor is being done by the spring which together with the motor forms a low damped system making the vibration isolation very effective.If there is more then one spring, the total stiffness of the springs must be ten times higher than the stiffness of the flexible air guide.An embodiment of the vacuum cleaner according to the invention is characterized in that all dynamic forces of the motor travel to the housing via the spring and/or the air guide.Since the air guide is relatively flexible and has a relatively low stiffness it will not form a vibration path from the motor to other parts of the vacuum cleaner.Due to the relatively stiff suspension of the spring which together with the motor forms a low damped system, an effective vibration isolation will be obtained. Since all dynamic force of the motor will be transmitted via the spring and/or the air guide, no other contact between the motor and the other parts of the vacuum cleaner is available for the transmission of vibrations.Another embodiment of the vacuum cleaner according to the invention is characterized in that the motor is suspended by at least two and more preferably three springs being fixed to the motor located near the centre of gravity of the motor. Preferably the springs comprise leaf springs.By having the springs fixed to the motor located near the centre of gravity vibrations of the motor in radial, axial and torsion directions can easily be suppressed.The point of action of the springs is preferably located in the centre of gravity to obtain optimum isolation.Preferably the leaf springs are made of metal.Such leaf springs can easily be designed to have the right stiffness and other characteristics in axial, radial and torsion direction.A further embodiment of the vacuum cleaner according to the invention is characterized in that the air guide is a flexible air guide comprising a first ring-shaped element connected to a separation wall between the dust compartment and the motor compartment, a second ring-shaped element connected to the motor, which second ring-shaped element has a diameter smaller than the diameter of the first ring-shaped element, the air guide further comprises a dome shaped membrane between the first and second ring-shaped elements.With such an air guide the motor can vibrate with respect to the separation wall whereby a leakage free sealing between the dust compartment and the motor is being maintained. Due to the dome shaped membrane movement of the second ring-shaped element with respect to the first ring-shaped element is possible. When pressure is applied on the membrane the dimension of the air inlet will change however maintaining an air inlet opening.Like parts are indicated by the same numerals in the various figures.shows a perspective cross section of a vacuum cleaner  of the invention. The vacuum cleaner  comprises a housing  with an air inlet opening  to a dust compartment . The housing  further comprising a separation wall  separating the dust compartment  from the motor compartment . In the motor compartment  a motor  is located. The vacuum cleaner  comprises a flexible air guide  connected with a first end  to the separation wall  and with a second end  to an impeller cover  (see ) of the motor .The housing  comprises an air outlet opening  which is connected via a duct (not visible) to the motor compartment .The vacuum cleaner  further comprises a flexible hose (not shown) which is connectable to the air inlet opening , a metal tube (not shown) connected to an end of the flexible hose at a side remote for the air inlet opening  and a suction head (not shown) connected to an end of the metal tube remote from the connection between the metal tube and the flexible hose. Such flexible hose, metal tube and suction head are well known in the state of the art and therefore not further described.shows an exploded view of the motor compartment  in which the motor  is located. The motor compartment  is bounded by a cilindrical housing  which is provided on the inside with noise absorption material . The housing  is connected at its lower end to a bottom surface  of the housing . To the bottom surface  a metal ring  is connected, in which ring  a ring of air absorption material  is located. In the centre of said ring  a elastic buffer  is positioned, the function of which will be explained below. The motor  comprises, as is more clearly visible in , a motor part  with an impeller part  which are mounted in a lower bracket  and a upper bracket . The flexible air guide  is connected with its second end  to the impeller cover  of the upper bracket .The motor  is suspended by means of three leaf springs  which leaf springs  are connected with a first end  to the lower bracket  and with a second end  remote from the first end  to the metal ring  at positions . The leaf springs  are made of metal and have a stiffness being at least ten times higher than stiffness of the flexible air guide .The leaf springs  are connected with the first end  at position  to the lower bracket  which positions  are at the same level as the centre of the gravity of the motor part  and the impeller part .disclose the flexible air guide  which is at a first end  provided with a first ring-shaped element  and at the second end  with a second ring-shaped element  which is connectable in a airtight manner to the impeller cover opening  of the upper bracket . Between the first and the second ring-shaped elements ,  the flexible air guide  is provided with a dome-shaped membrane  having a relatively low stiffness and having a thickness of about 0,8 mm.In axial direction the first ring-shaped element  is located higher than the second ring-shaped element . Due to the different levels of the ring-shaped elements ,  and the dome-shaped membrane  connecting both ring-shaped elements ,  the ring-shaped elements ,  and the objects connected thereto are movable with respect to each other both in axial, radial and torsion directions without the risk that the membrane  might block the inlet opening  of the flexible air guide .are a perspective view and perspective cross section of another embodiment of the flexible air guide  which flexible air guide  comprises a bellow . The bellow  is connected with a first end  to the end  of the separation wall  and with a second end  to the impeller cover  of the lower bracket .Such a bellow  provides a leakage free air guide between the dust compartment  and the motor . Such a bellow  is made for example of rubber, has relatively thin walls and a relatively low stiffness. To prevent the bellow  to close whenever there is pressure applied to it, it contains metal rings .shows another embodiment  of the motor  located in bracket ,  and the suspension of the motor  by means of three springs . Each spring  has a connecting part  at its lower end by means of which the leaf spring  is connected to the metal ring . The leaf spring  comprises a vertical extending part  connected to the connecting part  and a horizontal extending part  which is connected with a first end  to the vertical extending part  and an end remote of the connecting part . The horizontal extending part  is connected with a second end  remote of the first end  to the upper bracket .Such spring , preferably made of metal, provides a relatively high stiffness. The suspension of the motor  by means of the springs  or  of the motor  will now be explained with reference to .Due to the springs ,  the vibration isolation between the motor  and the housing  is being improved due to which a reduction of vibration level in the housing and therefor a reduction of the sound due to the vibrations is obtained. The motor  is suspended by means of the springs ,  within the housing  of the vacuum cleaner  in a practical and safe way meaning that the motor  can easily provide the suction power and that the vacuum cleaner can withstand the mechanical impact of the motor .The vibration isolation by means of the springs ,  can be described with a mass-spring-damper model, whereby the motor  forms the mass. If a dynamic force is excitation the mass, the reaction force acting at the rigid world (housing ) is a function of the frequency of the exciting force.By normal use the motor is rotated between 45.000 à 57.000 rotations per minute. The excitation frequency is then 750-950 Hertz.With suspension by means of metal springs a damping of about 0,1% of the critical damping of the suspension system including the motor can be realised.Since the suspension of the motor  of the vacuum cleaner  according to the invention has a low damping, the model can be considered to be a mass-spring model only but at frequencies much higher than the natural frequency of the mass-spring model, the reaction force is lower than the excitation force due to which vibration isolation is realised. With the springs ,  the natural frequency of the complete suspension system (i.e. suspension system including the motor) is at least three times lower than the excitation frequency.  shows at the horizontal axis the frequency, whereby  means the natural frequency of the suspension and , , ,  etc. meaning two times, three times, four times, five times the natural frequency. By the vacuum cleaner  according to the invention the natural frequency of the suspension is about - Herz. The vertical axis indicates the amplification of the movement caused by the excitation force.By having a relatively low damping of less than 1% a more effective vibration isolation is obtained than in case of a high damping material like rubber.By the vacuum cleaner  according to the invention the flexible air guide  provide a leakage free sealing between the dust compartment  and the motor . The flexibility of the air guide  is such that it does not influence the vibration isolation of the suspension of the motor  by means of the springs ,  but has sufficient stiffness to withstand the pressure difference between the dust compartment  and the motor .The suspension of the motor  by means of the springs ,  ensures that the motor  is kept in its desired position and ensures vibration isolation.The buffer  (see ) is located at a distance from the lower bracket  but will protect the suspension against high stress level, for example in case that the vacuum cleaner is being dropped and will limit the maximum displacement of the springs  in axial direction. Since the flexible air guide , the suspension by means of the springs ,  and the buffer  each have a different function, each element can be optimized for its specific function.It is also possible to another number of springs, other kind of springs, or springs made of other kind of materials as long the springs provide for a low damping the suspension.It is also possible to connect the springs directly to the motor part  instead to brackets surrounding the motor part ."

The light fixture  is disposed within the transport region  that is preferably defined by the length of the legs  and the base  in combination with bridge . It can be appreciated that the transport region  can be various sizes and configurations such without deterring from the spirit of the present invention. Likewise, the bridge  can be constructed to any number of configurations that provide protection for the light fixture  while in the transport region .As discussed above, the coupling  preferably provides a sliding engagement of either the deployment region  or the transport region . As such, the mast  laterally slides into the transport region  so that the coupling  traverses a portion of the mast , in a preferred embodiment. However, it should be noted that the light fixture  can be manipulated into the transport region  and transported without rotating the coupling . For example, the mast  can be removed from the coupling  and slid into the transport region .Further in various embodiments of the present invention, the light fixture  is preferably positioned in the transport region  with the light source facing the base  and legs . As a result, the light source, such as a light bulb, is protected from damage during transportation. Similarly, the arm , handle , and cord  are also protected from abuse during transportation by being disposed within the transport region. That is, the preferred configuration of the light fixture  within the transport region  positions the arm , handle , and cord  between the mast  and the light fixture .In , the portable light assembly  of  is illustrated in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. The light fixture  is shown disposed within the transport region  in an orientation that protects any light source from damage by facing the legs  and base .

The caps  can advantageously aid in the retention of lubrication in the hinge  while keeping unwanted particles out of the moving components. To facilitate securement of the arm  in relation to the mast , a pressure lever  capable of applying pressure to the friction member  is connected through the hinge . However, it should be noted that the use of a lever to apply pressure to the hinge  is not limiting as a variety of pressure applications can be utilized to secure the position of the arm  with respect to the mast .In an alternative embodiment, a manipulation lever  is connected to the second flange  to provide efficient precision of any adjustments in the position of the arm . It can be appreciated that the manipulation lever  can be any number of configurations, sizes, and shapes as desired. While the hinge  is shown having an infinite number of adjustable positions in only one plane, the hinge  is not limited to a single plane of operation. For example, a rotating joint can be connected to the first flange  to allow lateral rotation of the hinge  in combination with the vertical rotation shown in .Turning to , an exemplary exploded view of the hinge  of  is illustrated. The friction member  preferably includes a recess  to which the electrical cord  occupies. That is, the cord  enters the hinge  from a position internal to the mast  and remains internal until reaching an external position adjacent the arm . The ability to enclose the cord  during adjustment and operation of the light assembly  provides numerous advantages in safety, efficiency, and performance that cannot be achieved with conventional lights.In some embodiments, the recess  is internal to the friction member . As shown by the segmented recess , the cord  can occupy the recess  while being completely enclosed within the friction member . Further in various embodiments, the friction member  can comprise multiple pieces combine to form the recess . In addition, the preferred operation of the friction member  provides various adjustment and range of motion while maintaining the cord  within the recess  of the friction member . For example, the friction member  can have mirrored interior chambers that allow the cord  to enter the member  one side and exit the member  on the opposing side while remaining internal to the friction member  during various adjustments of the hinge .In , an exemplary handle  is shown constructed and operated in accordance with the various embodiments of the present invention. The handle  generally features a body  that defines an arm region  capable of receiving and securing the arm . That is, the arm region  preferably extends through the body  to allow both lateral and rotational adjustment of the handle . In some embodiments, the handle  provides compression force on the arm  to maintain a desired position until a trigger  is selected.Upon selection, any compression force on the arm  is removed and adjustment of the handle  is available. Thus, the trigger  allows operative selection of adjustment of the handle .It should be noted that the electrical cord  transitions from an external position to an internal position throughout the handle . However, the cord  returns to an external position as it connects to the light fixture. The internal configuration of the cord  provides improved performance and safety due to the ability to adjust the handle  and light fixture  without concern for the location of the cord . Such lack of loose entanglements around points of adjustment such as the handle , hinge , and light fixture  ensure precision and safety.shows the handle  of  in an exemplary exploded view. The trigger  is preferably connected to an handle lever  that facilitates the application of force on both the arm . In various embodiments, a plurality of springs  enable the trigger  and handle lever  to apply sufficient pressure to secure the handle  to the arm . As for the handle  securement to the arm , the handle lever  preferably forces a friction puck  into contacting engagement with the arm .Furthermore, a calibration screw  can be adjusted to modify an amount of frictional force applied by the handle  to the arm . It should be noted that the shape, size, and orientation of the handle  is not limited to the design displayed in . Likewise, the manner in which force is applied to the ball and socket joint  and the arm  is not limited and can be modified as necessary to restrict unwanted movement of the handle  and joint .It can be appreciated that the exploded views of  are merely clarifying in nature and do not limit the configuration or design of the individual components. As such, various members can be included, or excluded, as necessary to maintain the spirit of the present invention.Turning now to , an exemplary light fixture  is displayed as constructed in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. The light fixture  generally features a body  that can be configured in a number of configurations to provide light at various angles. Further, a lens region  is defined within the body  by a first open hem  and a second open hem . In some embodiments, the first open hem  is connected to a baffle member  that can be configured to enclose any electrical components of the light fixture  such as, but not limited to, transformers and wires.Further in various embodiments, a lens  can engage and be secured in the lens region  without a fastener in a variety of different configurations, shown by segmented lines  and . That is, a lens  can be secured in the lens region  by contactingly engaging the first and second open hems  and  to form a number of different shapes. However, it should be noted that the number and size of open hems is not limited as a single open hem could be facilitated to secure a lens .In addition, the light fixture  preferably includes a light source , such as a light bulb, that is positioned in front of the lens region . To clarify, the light source  is positioned so that a lens  can only modify indirect light. For example, if a green tinted lens  is secured in the lens region , the light will emit normal colored direct light in combination with green tinted indirect light that reflects off the lens . Hence, the placement of the light source  at the same elevation as the second open hem  advantageously allows a large amount of indirect light to be reflected towards a desired target.provides an exemplary deployment operation  performed in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. In step , a portable light assembly is provided having at least a base, bridge, mast, hinge, arm, and light fixture.

The case  has two hooks and the case  has two openings to be engaged with the hooks that the cases  and  are combined to couple the cords. However, the cases  and  are opened only when one exerts a great force to disengage the hooks and the openings It may cause danger for children who play the cords and children might be strangulated by the cords before disengagement and open of the cord release.shows another conventional cord release  which includes three cases  combined together by flexible hooks and slots Each case  has the hook and the slot on opposite side to be engaged with the corresponding slots and hooks of the neighboring cases .When a child is strangulated by the cords and struggles to get away, the cords will be pulled outwards respectively to disengage the hooks from the slots that the cases  are opened to release the cords, and the child may get away from the cords.The hooks and the slots are adjacent to tops of the cases  and they are at the same level that the hooks and the slots need to be disengaged at the same time in order to open the cord release . For instance, suppose a predetermined force is needed to disengage a pair of the hook from the slot it needs 3 times the strength of the force to open the three cases . Furthermore, the cord release  may not be totally opened when an unbalanced force is exerted to the cords that only one case  is disengaged and the rest two are still engaged together. In this condition, the cords may not be released that they may still cause danger. In other word, the conventional cord releases still need to be improved.The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a safety cord release of a window covering, which may release the cord by a low transverse force.According to the objective of the present invention, a safety cord release for a window covering includes a right case and a left case. The right case has an edge, a recess to receive the cords therein, and at least a cord fastener projected from a sidewall of the recess to fasten cords.

The protrusion  and the slot  are referred as a second pair of couplers, and the second protrusion  and the second slot  are referred as a third pair of couplers.The right case  has a fourth coupling portion, which is a protrusion  on the edge at the bottom section and the left case  has a fourth connecting portion, which is a slot  on the edge in association with the protrusion  for engagement when the right case  and left case  are in the closed position, and they are referred as a fourth pair of couplers.Above couplers are provided on the edges of the cases. There still are other couplers to be described hereunder.As shown in , the right case  is provided with a fifth coupling portion, which is a slot , at a top side of the bottom cord fastener and the left case  is provided with a fifth connecting portion, which is a protrusion , at a bottom side of the bottom cord fastener As shown in , the right case  is provided with a sixth coupling portion, which is a slot , on a bottom side of the top cord fastener and the left case  is provided with a sixth connecting portion, which is a protrusion , at a top side of the top cord fastener As shown in , because the first distance S between the top and bottom cord fasteners of the right case  is greater than the second distance S between the top and bottom cord fasteners of the left case , the slot  is engaged with the protrusion  and the slot  is engaged with the protrusion  when the right case  and left case  are in the closed position. The slot  and the protrusion  are referred as a fifth pair of couplers, and the slot  and the protrusion  are referred as a sixth pair of couplers.As shown in  and , the right case  has a right protrusion  and a rib on the right protrusion , which are projected from the sidewall of the recess at the middle section It forms a left cord slot and a right cord slot between the right protrusion  and the top and bottom cord fasteners respectively to receive the cords . The right case  has a seventh coupling portion, which is a slot , located at a front bottom end of the right protrusion . The left case  has a left protrusion  and two ribs  on the left protrusion , which are projected from the sidewall of the recess It forms a left cord slot and a right cord slot between the left protrusion  and the top and bottom cord fasteners respectively to receive the cords . The left case  has a seventh connecting portion, which is a protrusion , located at a front up end of the right protrusion  to be engaged with the slot  of the right case  when the right case  and left case  are in the closed position. The slot  and the protrusion  are referred as a seventh pair of couplers.The left cord slots and the right cord slots may each receive a plurality of cords  to separate the cords  in the safety cord release  and to prevent the cords from be tangled. Knots of the cords  may rest on bottom sides of the right and left protrusion . Widths of the cord slots, which are identical to distances between the protrusions and the cord fasteners, are smaller than the knots of the cords. It would help the tangled cords  in the cord slots to be back to order when the cords are pulled by the transverse force.In conclusion, the present invention provides seven pairs of couplers to connect the right case  and the left case , and these couplers are separated in top, middle and bottom sections of the safety cord release . The present invention also provides the function of fastening the cords  to the right and left protrusions ,  at the middle section Preferably, a distance between the bottom sides of the right and left protrusions ,  and the top side of the safety cord release  is greater than 50% of a distance between the top side and the bottom side of the safety cord release . The top opening A of the safety cord release  is elliptical, as shown in , which has a long axis substantially parallel to the edges that when a child has his/her head between the cords to exert the cords  with the transverse force, the safety cord release  will be forced to have the cords  moving to opposite ends of the long axis of the elliptical top opening A that the transverse force will force the right case  and the left case  tending to move away from each other, preventing cords  to be pinched at the gaps of edges and When the transverse force disengages the slot  and the protrusion  (the first pair of coupler), the top of the right case  and the left case  will be separated. When the transverse force is continuously exerted, the second pair, third pair, and the fifth pair to the seventh pair of couplers will be disengaged in sequence to release the cords  from the safety cord release . The value of the transverse force to open the safety cord release  of the present invention is not a sum of the forces to disengage the first to seven pairs of couplers because these couplers are disengaged in sequence.The transverse force only needs to disengage the first pair of couplers, it may open the safety cord release  of the present invention to prevent the strangulation of kids.The cords  is fastened at the middle section of the safety cord release  of the present invention that the cords  may produce a great torque to open the right case  and the left case . For the same principle, it is more effective when the cords  are fastened closer to the bottom sectionThe description above is a few preferred embodiments of the present invention and the equivalence of the present invention is still in the scope of claim construction of the present invention."

It is noted that the distance D is much less than the distance D of the prior art described in the background paragraph of the invention.As shown in , the ring  is at an angle with respect to a longitudinal center line  of the wire L passing through the upper jaw  and the lower jaw . As shown in , the ring  is at an angle in a range between 1-degree and 60-degree with respect to a center line  of the wire L as preferred by the invention. As shown in , the ring  is at an angle in a range between 15-degree and 45-degree with respect to the center line  of the wire L as more preferred by the invention.A wire pulling operation of the invention will be described in detail below by referring to . First attach a hook H at one end of a chain to the ring . Next, activate a pulling device to pull the chain and thus the ring . Preferably, the wire L will not be bent or otherwise damaged because the ring  is besides the wire L with a minimum distance D therebetween (see ).Advantageously, center of the pulling force is at a minimum angle with respect to center line of wire L (see ). Hence, a substantial portion of the pulling force is exerted on the wire L via the jaws , . This has the benefits of decreasing the possibility of bending and/or twisting the wire L to a minimum, and thus positively preventing the wire L from being damaged.While the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modifications within the spirit and scope of the appended claims."

                "This application claims priority to U.S. Design Patent Application No. 29/357,976 filed Mar. 19, 2010; U.S. Design Patent Application No. 29/363,321 filed Jun. 8, 2010; U.S. Design Patent Application No. 29/363,322 filed Jun. 8, 2010; and U.S. Design Patent Application No. 29/363,317 filed Jun. 8, 2010, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.The present invention relates to a magnetically coupled jewelry clasp that can be decoupled with substantial ease by applying force slightly greater than the magnetic coupling force in a first direction, but the coupled jewelry clasp cannot be decoupled with substantial ease by applying force that is not in the first direction.In exemplary embodiments, a jewelry clasp can comprise a first jewelry interfacer that can include a first jewelry retainer affixed to a male magnetic interfacer, the male magnetic interfacer can also include a cantilevered male protrusion. The first jewelry retainer can retain jewelry that extends substantially at a non-zero angle to the cantilevered male protrusion. The jewelry clasp can further comprise a second jewelry interfacer that can include a second jewelry retainer affixed to a female magnetic interfacer, the female magnetic interfacer can also include a female receiving region. The second jewelry retainer can retain jewelry that extends substantially at a non-zero angle to the female receiving region. Further, the cantilevered male protrusion can be capable of being received into the female receiving region and the first and second jewelry retainers can magnetically couple to each other such that the cantilevered male protrusion and the female receiving region can remain substantially parallel to each other and the first and second jewelry retainers can retain jewelry that extends substantially at a non-zero angle to the cantilevered male protrusion and/or the female receiving region.In exemplary embodiments, when force is applied by jewelry retained in the first and/or second jewelry retainers at least some of the retaining force can be absorbed and/or distributed and/or distributed on the cantilevered male protrusion by a moment and/or shear stress.In exemplary embodiments, the first jewelry interfacer and the second jewelry interfacer can be decoupled by applying a force large enough to overcome the magnetic coupling force in a direction that is substantially parallel to the cantilevered male protrusion.In exemplary embodiments, a region of the female magnetic interfacer and/or a region of the cantilevered male protrusion can include a magnet and/or ferromagnetic material.In exemplary embodiments, a region of the female magnetic interfacer can include at least one magnet and/or a region of the cantilevered male protrusion can include at least one magnet. Further, in exemplary embodiments, the at least one magnet of the cantilevered male protrusion can be located substantially near the distal most point of the cantilevered male protrusion and the at least one magnet of the female magnetic interfacer can be located at substantially near the deepest point of the female region.In exemplary embodiments, the at least one magnet of the cantilevered male protrusion can be located substantially along the length of the cantilevered male protrusion and the at least one magnet of the female magnetic interfacer can be located substantially along the length of the female region. In exemplary embodiments, the cantilevered male protrusion can substantially be and/or can be constructed of one or more magnets.In exemplary embodiments, the cross-sectional shape of the cantilevered male protrusion and/or the female magnetic interfacer can be substantially round, square, polygonal, triangular, star shaped, quadrilateral, pentagonal, hexagonal, octagonal, enneagonal, and/or decagonal. In exemplary embodiments, the cross-sectional shape of the cantilevered male protrusion and the female magnetic interfacer can be square. In exemplary embodiments, the cross-sectional shape of the elements of the jewelry clasp can include at least one curved surface.In exemplary embodiments, the first jewelry retainer, the second jewelry retainer, the male magnetic interfacer, the cantilevered male protrusion, and the female magnetic interfacer can each be rectangular cuboid, a square cuboid, and/or a parallelepiped shape. Further, the cantilevered male protrusion and the female magnetic interfacer can each be rectangular cuboid, a square cuboid, and/or a parallelepiped shape.In exemplary embodiments, when the first jewelry interfacer and the second jewelry interfacer are coupled they can form a shape that is rectangular cuboid, a square cuboid, and/or a parallelepiped shape.In exemplary embodiments, at least one of the first jewelry retainer and the second jewelry retainer can retain at least one string of beads. Further, the at least one string of beads can be retained in a channel.In exemplary embodiments, the male magnetic interfacer and the cantilevered male protrusion can be combined into substantially one cantilevered male magnetic interfacer that is affixed to the first jewelry retainer.In exemplary embodiments, the first jewelry retainer, the second jewelry retainer, the male magnetic interfacer, the cantilevered male protrusion, and/or the female magnetic interfacer can be at least partially constructed of gold, silver, platinum, aluminum, pewter, palladium, any other reasonable material.In exemplary embodiments, the jewelry clasp can further comprise at least one interim jewelry interfacer that can include an interim female magnetic interfacer affixed to an interim male magnetic interfacer such that the interim female magnetic interfacer and the interim male magnetic interfacer can be affixed in a position substantially parallel to each other. The interim male magnetic interfacer can include an interim cantilevered male protrusion. The interim female magnetic interfacer can be capable receiving the cantilevered male protrusion of the first jewelry interfacer such that the interim female magnetic interfacer and cantilevered male protrusion of the first jewelry interfacer can be magnetically coupled. Further, the interim cantilevered male protrusion can be capable of being inserted into the female magnetic interfacer of the second jewelry interfacer such that the interim male magnetic interfacer and female magnetic interfacer of the second jewelry interfacer can be magnetically coupled.In exemplary embodiments, an interim jewelry clasp can include an interim jewelry interfacer that can include an interim female magnetic interfacer affixed to an interim male magnetic interfacer such that the interim female magnetic interfacer and the interim male magnetic interfacer can be affixed in a position substantially parallel to each other. The interim male magnetic interfacer can include an interim cantilevered male protrusion. The interim female magnetic interfacer can be capable receiving a cantilevered male protrusion of a first jewelry interfacer such that the interim female magnetic interfacer and cantilevered male protrusion of the first jewelry interfacer can be magnetically coupled. Further, the interim cantilevered male protrusion can be capable of being inserted into a female magnetic interfacer of a second jewelry interfacer such that the interim male magnetic interfacer and female magnetic interfacer of the second jewelry interfacer can be magnetically coupled.Generally, the jewelry clasp of the present invention includes at least a first jewelry interfacer and a second jewelry interfacer capable of magnetically coupling together. The magnetic coupling can be designed such that the first and second jewelry interfacers can decouple with substantial ease by applying force substantially in a first direction. However, the first and second jewelry interfacers may be substantially difficult to decouple when force is applied that is not substantially in the first direction. As described below, the first direction can be defined by elements of the jewelry clasp which couple together. Further, the first and second jewelry interfacers can be coupled to at least one article of jewelry that can be at a substantial angle to the first direction. Thus, force applied from the article of jewelry on the jewelry clasp may not be applied substantially in the first direction making it substantially difficult to decouple the first and second jewelry interfacers.Referring to , in exemplary embodiments, a jewelry clasp  can include a first jewelry interfacer  and a second jewelry interfacer . First jewelry interfacer  can include a first jewelry retaining region  capable of retaining an end  of an article of jewelry. Further, first jewelry interfacer  can include a male magnetic interfacing region  having a cantilevered male protrusion . Second jewelry interfacer  can include a second jewelry retaining region  capable of retaining an end  of an article of jewelry. Further, second jewelry interfacer  can include a female magnetic interfacing region  having a female receiving region .In exemplary embodiments, first and/or second jewelry interfacer / can include at least one magnetic material (not shown) and female receiving region  can receive cantilevered male protrusion  such that first and second jewelry interfacer / magnetically couple when cantilevered male protrusion  is received by female receiving region . The combination of the at least one magnetic material and the mechanical interactions of female receiving region  receiving cantilevered male protrusion  can substantially limit the direction in which force can be applied to decouple the first and second jewelry interfacer / with substantial ease.For example, referring to , jewelry clasp  can be coupled by receiving cantilevered male protrusion  into female receiving region  such that magnets located in first and/or second jewelry interfacer / magnetically attract and cause first jewelry interfacer  and second jewelry interfacer  to magnetically couple. In exemplary embodiments, when first and second jewelry interfacer / are magnetically coupled together, forces applied from ends / of an article of jewelry can be substantially absorbed and/or distributed by mechanical interactions of jewelry clasp . Since these forces are absorbed and/or distributed, the amount of force applied against the magnetic coupling may not be enough to overcome the magnitude of magnetic attractive force coupling the first and second jewelry interfacer /. Further, forces applied from ends / of an article of jewelry may not be substantially applied in a direction that can cause the first jewelry interfacer  and second jewelry interfacer  to magnetically decouple.Referring to , when first and second jewelry interfacer / are magnetically coupled together, force  applied from ends / of an article of jewelry can be absorbed and/or distributed by the mechanical properties of at least some of the elements of first and second jewelry interfacer /. Mechanical properties can be, but are not limited to, a moment and/or shear stress created by interactions with cantilevered male protrusion  and other elements of first and second jewelry interfacer /, deformation of at least some elements of first and second jewelry interfacer /, and any other mechanical property capable of absorbing and/or distributing force. Noting these mechanical properties, jewelry clasp  can be substantially difficult to decouple when force  is exerted from end / of jewelry because the magnitude and/or direction of force  may not be applied directly and/or substantially translated in the direction needed to overcome the magnitude of magnetic attractive force coupling first and second jewelry interfacer /.In exemplary embodiments, when first and second jewelry interfacer / are magnetically coupled together, force  can be applied by, for example, a user to decouple first and second jewelry interfacer / with substantial ease. Force  may only be, but is not limited to, slightly stronger than the magnitude of magnetic attractive force coupling first and second jewelry interfacer / and force  can be applied in a direction substantially parallel to the length of female receiving region  and/or cantilevered male protrusion . By way of example, if a user applies force  that is larger than the magnitude of magnetic attractive force coupling first and second jewelry interfacer / together and force  is applied in a direction substantially parallel to the length of female receiving region  and/or cantilevered male protrusion , jewelry clasp  can be decoupled with substantial ease and cantilevered male protrusion  can slide out of female receiving region . Thus, an ordinary person can apply a force that is not substantially difficult to decouple jewelry clasp , but this force required to decouple jewelry clasp  may be large enough such that jewelry clasp  does not substantially risk decoupling accidently and/or when not desired by the user.In exemplary embodiments, the force required to decouple first and second jewelry interfacer / may increase as the angle of the applied forces direction moves from substantially parallel, at a zero angle, to cantilevered male protrusion  through various non-zero angles to substantially perpendicular, at a non-zero ninety degree angle, to cantilevered male protrusion .It will be understood that the article of jewelry can be any article/ornament and/or plurality of articles/ornaments such as, but not limited to, a necklace, earrings, bracelet, watch, anklet, or any other reasonable article/ornament worn as an adornment. In some instances, the article of jewelry can be any plurality of items intended to be releasably coupled. Further, the article of jewelry need not directly connect first jewelry interfacer  and second jewelry interfacer . For example, any number of additional jewelry interfacers can be located between first jewelry interfacer  and second jewelry interfacer . For ease, at times, the article of jewelry is described as a beaded necklace connected at both ends to jewelry interfacers. This is in no way meant to be a limitation, rather it is merely for ease.Referring to , in exemplary embodiments, jewelry retaining region / can include at least one slot and/or openings  for receiving at least one end of an article of jewelry. For example, referring to , a single slot  can retain a single row of beads; referring to , a plurality of slots  can retain a plurality of rows of beads; and, referring to , the size of slot  can be large enough to retain a plurality of rows of beads. Referring to , slot  can include a plurality of openings. These openings can be designed to receive a single column of beads which may combine to form a row of beads. Further, the shape of slot  can be any reasonable shape such as round, square, polygonal, triangular, star shaped, quadrilateral, pentagonal, hexagonal, octagonal, enneagonal, and decagonal, to name a few.In exemplary embodiments, at least one end of an article of jewelry can be affixed to the surface, and/or some surface variation, of jewelry retaining region /. For example, jewelry retaining region / may not include a slot and/or opening and at least one end of an article of jewelry can be affixed to, for example, the surface of jewelry retaining region / by any reasonable technique, such as, but not limited to, solder, adhesive, and/or by any technique. The surface of jewelry retaining region / can be substantially smooth and/or can include surface variations such as, but not limited to, dimples, grooves, and/or any other variation. Further, any combination of any number of slots, openings, surfaces, and surface variations can be combined and/or further separated without deviating from the scope of the invention.It will be understood that any number of articles of jewelry can be affixed to any number of jewelry interfacers by any technique such as, but not limited to, mechanically affixing, adhesively adhering, chemically bonding, by any combination thereof, or by any other reasonable technique capable of affixing jewelry to an interfacer. Mechanically affixing can include any technique such as, but is not limited to, retaining a region and/or end of an article of jewelry, surrounding a region and/or end of an article of jewelry, deforming a region and/or end of an article of jewelry, soldering a region and/or end of an article of jewelry, welding a region and/or end of an article of jewelry, any combination thereof, or any other mechanical affixing technique capable of affixing jewelry to an interfacer. Adhesively adhering can include any technique using any adhesive such as, but not limited to, cyanoacrylate, jewelry adhesive, urea-formaldehyde, resorcinol, phenol formaldehyde resin, animal glues, polyvinyl acetate, polyurethane glue, epoxy, contact cement, hot melt, hot bitumen, cold adhesives, any combination thereof, or any other adhesive capable of affixing jewelry to an interfacer. Chemical bonding can include any technique such as, but not limited to, melting, smelting, or any technique capable of affixing jewelry to an interfacer. For ease, at times, a beaded necklace is described as having an end bead retained by a jewelry retaining region. This is in no way meant to be a limitation, rather it is merely for ease.Referring to , in exemplary embodiments, at least one magnetic material  can be located at can be substantially near the distal tip of cantilevered male protrusion  and/or substantially near the base of female magnetic interfacing region . Further, a plurality of magnetic materials  can be located at the distal tip of cantilevered male protrusion  and/or substantially near the base of female magnetic interfacing region .In exemplary embodiments, although not shown, at least one magnetic material  can be located at any reasonable location in first and second jewelry interfacer /.

Further, a plurality of magnetic material  can be located at any reasonable location in first and second jewelry interfacer /. For example, a plurality of magnetic materials  can be located at the distal tip of cantilevered male protrusion  and/or substantially near the base of female magnetic interfacing region . As another example, a plurality of magnetic materials  can be located at least partially along the length of cantilevered male protrusion  and/or along at least some length of second jewelry retaining region  and/or along at least some length of female magnetic interfacing region .In exemplary embodiments, although not shown, cantilevered male protrusion  can be and/or can be constructed substantially of at least one magnet. For example, cantilevered male protrusion  can be a single magnet and/or can be and/or can be constructed from a plurality of magnets.It will be understood that at least one magnetic material  can be any form of magnet, ferrous material, any combination thereof, or any other material capable of generating and/or interacting with magnetic forces. For example, at least one magnet can be located at the distal tip of cantilevered male protrusion  and a ferrous material can be located substantially near the base of female magnetic interfacing region . As another example, at least one magnet can be located at the distal tip of cantilevered male protrusion  and at least one magnet can be located substantially near the base of female magnetic interfacing region . For ease, at times, at least one magnetic material  is described as a magnet. This is in no way meant to be a limitation, rather it is merely for ease.Referring to , in exemplary embodiments, first jewelry retaining region , male magnetic interfacing region , cantilevered male protrusion , second jewelry retaining region , female magnetic interfacing region , and/or female receiving region  can have any reasonable cross-sectional shape, such as, but not limit to, round, square, polygonal, triangular, star shaped, quadrilateral, pentagonal, hexagonal, octagonal, enneagonal, and decagonal, to name a few.For example, referring to , each of first jewelry retaining region , male magnetic interfacing region , cantilevered male protrusion , second jewelry retaining region , female magnetic interfacing region , and/or female receiving region  can have a cross-sectional shape which is substantial square. As another example, referring to , cantilevered male protrusion  and female receiving region  can have a cross-sectional shape which is substantial rounded while first jewelry retaining region , male magnetic interfacing region , second jewelry retaining region , and female magnetic interfacing region  can have a cross-sectional shape which is substantially square.As yet another example, although not shown, cantilevered male protrusion  and female receiving region  can have a cross-sectional shape which is substantially round and female magnetic interfacing region , male magnetic interfacing region , first jewelry retaining region , and second jewelry retaining region  can include at least one curved surface. This may be done such that first and second jewelry interfacer / can be capable of pivoting relative to each other. Any of the elements of jewelry clasp  can include a cross-sectional shape capable of producing at least one curved surface. For ease, at times, the cross-sectional shape of first jewelry retaining region , male magnetic interfacing region , cantilevered male protrusion , second jewelry retaining region , female magnetic interfacing region , and/or female receiving region  is described as being substantially square. This is in no way meant to be a limitation, rather it is merely for ease.Referring to , in exemplary embodiments, first jewelry retaining region , male magnetic interfacing region , cantilevered male protrusion , second jewelry retaining region , female magnetic interfacing region , female receiving region , or any other elements of jewelry clasp  can be shaped and these shapes can be combined when jewelry clasp  is coupled forming a geometric shape. For example, referring to , each of the elements of jewelry clasp  and/or the overall shape of jewelry clasp  when coupled can have a substantially hexahedron shape such as, but not limited to, cuboid, parallelepiped, rhombohedron, trigonal trapezohedron, any combination thereof, or any other reasonable hexahedron shape.

In use, first jewelry interfacer  and second jewelry interfacer  can couple to interim connector  in a substantially similar fashion to that described above for coupling first jewelry interfacer  and second jewelry interfacer . For example, cantilevered male protrusion  of first jewelry interfacer  can be received by female receiving region  and cantilevered male protrusion  can be received by female receiving region  of second jewelry interfacer .It will be understood that any number of interim connectors  can be coupled together. For ease, only one interim connector  is described. This is in no way meant to be a limitation, rather this is merely for ease. Further, it will be understood that any of the variations first and/or second jewelry interfacer / can similarly be applied to any number of interim connectors .In exemplary embodiments, any of the elements of first and/or second jewelry interfacer / can be substantially hollow, substantially solid, or any combination thereof. Further, any of the elements of first and/or second jewelry interfacer / can be constructed from any material such as, but not limited to, gold, platinum, palladium, titanium, silver, tungsten carbide, stainless steel, rhodium, any combination thereof, or any other reasonable material for constructing jewelry.Further, first and/or second jewelry interfacer / can be about 0.5 to 10.0 centimeters in length, can have a cross-sectional shape about 1 to 20 millimeters across, and each of the components can be constructed of a material that is 0.1 to 3 millimeter thick.

                "The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for securing cargo.Many situations arise in which there is a requirement to secure cargo by means of straps. In some circumstances, metal straps may be used under tension, with a seal device to hold the ends of the strap together. Metal straps have the disadvantage that when cut under tension, the cut ends may whip away from the cargo, as the tension is released, presenting a danger to personnel.In an alternative, extruded or woven straps such as polyester or another synthetic plastic material are used with buckles. These straps have a reduced tendency to whip when cut under tension, and are less dangerous if they do, but it is found that the tension which can be achieved with known plastic strap and buckle arrangements is less than with known metal strap arrangements, resulting in a less secure hold on the cargo.Examples of the present invention provide a buckle for a flexible cargo strap, comprising:The coated surface may have an adhesive coating by which the grit material is secured to the coated surface. The adhesive coating may be a water-based adhesive. Alternatively, the coated surface may be coated by an abrasive coating containing grit material.The grit material may be an abrasive grit. The grit material may be tungsten carbide, diamond, crushed glass, sand, silica powder, aluminium oxide, pumice or iron oxide.The coated surface may be provided by the surface of a length of metal rod. The metal rod may be bent to form the buckle. The metal rod may be steel.The buckle may comprise:The buckle may further comprise a third surface corresponding with the first surface, for the other working end of the strap, and a fourth surface corresponding with the second surface, against which the other working end is pressed, in use, and wherein one or both of the third and fourth surfaces are coated in grit material, as aforesaid.Examples of the present invention also provide a cargo strapping arrangement comprising a flexible cargo strap for passing around the cargo, and a buckle as defined in any of the preceding definitions, for securing the ends of the cargo strap together.Examples of the present invention also provide a cargo strapping arrangement comprising a flexible cargo strap around a cargo, and a buckle as defined in any of the preceding definitions, the buckle securing the ends of the cargo strap together.The strap may be woven or extruded and may be a synthetic plastic material.Examples of the present invention also provide a buckle for a flexible cargo strap, comprising at least one abrasive surface against which the strap bears, in use.The drawings illustrate a buckle  being used to secure a cargo  by means of a flexible cargo strap  which extends around the cargo . As will be described in more detail below, the buckle  has at least one surface  () against which the strap  bears, in use. The surface  is abrasive, in this example. The surface  is coated in a grit material , in this example.In more detail, the cargo  illustrated in  is a bundle of elongate items. The cargo strap  extends around the cargo . The bight  of the strap  is held in position around the cargo  by securing together the free or working ends  of the strap  by means of the buckle . This can be seen particularly in . The working ends  follow a convoluted path around elements of the buckle  to create friction between the working ends  and the buckle . This friction serves to hold the bight  under tension.In the example being described, both ends of the strap  are used as working ends  for engagement with the buckle  in similar manner. Alternatively, one end may be secured permanently to the buckle , leaving only a single working end  for threading through the buckle , after the bight  has been passed around the cargo .The buckle  is formed from a length of rod or bar bent into a loop of generally square or rectangular form. The material of the buckle  may be a steel, such as bright drawn mild steel. The buckle  has two terminal arms  which extend generally parallel to each other, to the extreme ends . The terminal arms  therefore define a plane , indicated in . Between the terminal arms , the buckle is bent to form a generally square or rectangular loop  in a second plane . The ends of the loop  are connected with the terminal arms  by sloping portions . The plane of the terminal arms  is spaced slightly from the plane of the loop . The loop  has two generally straight side portions  running generally parallel with, and slightly spaced from respective terminal arms .Grit material  is coated onto various surfaces of the buckle , as has been described. In this example, grit material  is coated onto the terminal arms . Grit material  is also coated onto the side portions . In each case, grit material  is preferably coated around substantially the whole circumference of the arm  or portion , and along substantially the whole length of the arm  or portion .In this example, the coated surfaces have an adhesive coating by which the grit material is secured to the coated surface. In this example, the adhesive coating is a water-based adhesive. Other adhesive materials may be used. The grit material may be an abrasive grit. The grit material may be tungsten carbide, diamond, crushed glass, sand, silica powder, aluminium oxide, pumice or iron oxide. An abrasive coating containing grit material may be applied to the surface to be rendered abrasive, for example by applying a paint into which the grit has been introduced.When the strapping arrangement is used, each working end  of the strap  is threaded through the buckle  in the manner which is illustrated in . After passing the bight  around the cargo , the working end  is passed between the buckle  and the cargo . The buckle  is positioned with the loop  facing the cargo , between the cargo  and the terminal arms . The working end  is then passed through the loop , between the terminal arms , around one of the terminal arms  and back through the loop . The working end  then passes away from the buckle , under the respective side portion . Both ends of the strap  may be threaded in this manner, as illustrated in , or one end of the strap  may be threaded, the other being permanently attached to the buckle , as noted above.Once threaded in this manner, the working end  can be pulled through the buckle  to increase the tension in the bight . A tensioning tool may be used for this purpose. As the bight tension increases, the bight  becomes pressed more tightly toward the side portion . This traps the working end  between the side portion  and the bight . The tension in the bight  also serves to pull the working end  against the terminal arm .This results in friction between the working end  and the surface of the terminal arm , and further friction between the working end  and the side portion . In particular, friction will be created between the working end  and those regions of the terminal arms  which face away from the cargo . Further friction will be created particularly between the working end  and the surface of the side portion , particularly those regions of the side portion surface which face the cargo  and face inwardly of the loop .It is one or more of these regions, in particular, which are coated with the grit material . Accordingly, this friction is enhanced by the abrasive nature of the grit material . We have found grit material to be compatible with extruded or woven cargo straps, particularly those made of synthetic plastics materials such as polyester, because of the tendency of the grit material to dig into the polyester. This creates good grip of the strap by the buckle, even if the strap is wet.Tension in the bight  can be further increased by pulling additional lengths of the working ends  through the buckle .In one example, the buckle  is manufactured by first bending a suitable length of buckle material to the required form and then dipping the buckle  into adhesive. After coating the buckle  with adhesive, it may be dipped into grit material , preferably in powder or granular form, to coat the buckle . This dipping process can readily coat the entire surface of the buckle  with adhesive, and therefore with grit material. We have found that this may further assist the retention of the strap . For example, the edges of the strap  may rub against the sloping portions , so that grit material  on the sloping portions  can provide a further contribution to the performance of the buckle . Similarly, the sloping portions  may rub against each other if the buckle  deforms under load and again, the presence of grit material  on the sloping portions  may further contribute to the performance of the buckle .Alternatively, grit material  may be applied selectively to regions of the surface of the buckle , particularly those regions noted above as contributing to the grip of the working end  by the buckle .Many variations modifications can be made to the apparatus described above, without departing from the scope of the invention. In particular, the shape, form, dimensions and relative dimensions of the buckle may be changed, for example to modify the grip characteristics and to accommodate different sizes of strap . Many different grit materials could be used in addition to those described. The grit material may be chosen, in part, with reference to the form and material of the strap with which the buckle is intended to be used. The adhesive material may be chosen, in a practical situation, to be compatible with the material of the buckle  and of the grit material .Whilst endeavoring in the foregoing specification to draw attention to those features of the invention believed to be of particular importance it should be understood that the Applicant claims protection in respect of any patentable feature or combination of features hereinbefore referred to and/or shown in the drawings whether or not particular emphasis has been placed thereon."

                "The invention relates to a slide fastener with a separable bottom end stop, and more particularly, to a slide fastener with a separable bottom end stop including an insert member and a pivot stopper body and having a structure capable of engaging the insert member with the pivot stopper body in two ways of engagement operations.Conventionally, as a slide fastener with a separable bottom end stop, there has been known a slide fastener with a side open type separable bottom end stop that is capable of coupling left and right element rows by allowing an insert member disposed on one end of one element row to be inserted into and engaged with a pivot support member disposed on an end portion of the other element row from the side of the pivot support member.Further, as a slide fastener with such a side open type separable bottom end stop, a slide fastener in which usability of the bottom end stop is improved is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2008-43568 (Patent Document 1).As illustrated in , a slide fastener  with a separable bottom end stop  disclosed in Patent Document 1 includes a pair of left and right fastener stringers  in which element rows  are formed such that a plurality of independent synthetic resin fastener elements  are lined on left and right fastener tapes , a separable bottom end stop  disposed on one end portion of the element rows , and a slider (not shown).In the slide fastener , the fastener element  is formed in a predetermined shape by performing injection molding on the fastener tape . As the slider that allows the element row  including the fastener elements  to pass through, a general slider that has been known in the past can be used.The separable bottom end stop  includes an insert member  that is formed continuously from the element row , disposed at a lower end portion of the left fastener tape , and serves as an insert pin and a pivot stopper body  that is disposed at a lower end portion of the right fastener tape  and serves as a box pin and a box.The insert member  includes an insert plate portion of a thin plate form fixed to both front and back surfaces of the left fastener tape , a to-be-pivoted portion (a pivot shaft portion) that is disposed to protrude in a tape front-back direction at a leading end portion (a rear end portion) of the insert plate portion at a tape end portion side, a projecting portion formed along the tape inner side edge of the insert plate portion a coupling portion (hook portion) disposed at an end portion (a front end portion) of the insert plate portion at the element row  side, and a recess portion formed on the front and rear surfaces of the insert plate portionBoth the front and rear surfaces of the insert plate portion are flat except the recess portion and the thickness of the insert plate portion in the tape front-back direction is set to be smaller than an size of the clearance formed between upper and lower flanges of the slider. The insert plate portion has a notch portion that is cut toward the inside of the tape from the tape end portion side.The pivot stopper body  includes a slider holding portion (a box pin portion) that is formed on both front and rear surfaces of the right fastener tape , a pivot stopper portion (a box portion) that is formed at a thickness thicker than the slider holding portion via a step portion and has a substantially J shape in the front view, and a reinforcement portion that is formed closer to the tape inner side further than the slider holding portion and increases the strength of fixing of the pivot stopper body  to the fastener tape . Further, an engaging concave groove that engages the insert plate portion is formed in part of the side surface of the slider holding portion opposite to the insert plate portion and part of the side surface of the pivot stopper portion opposite to the insert plate portionFurther, the insert member opposing side edge of the slider holding portion curves such that an intermediate portion thereof slightly expands toward the insert member . Further, when the slider slides to come in a contact with the step portion the slider holding portion can be inserted into an element guide passage of the slider and hold the slider.The pivot stopper portion includes a pivot space that is opened upward so that the to-be-pivoted portion of the insert member  can be engaged or disengaged through the side of the pivot stopper body  and an inner peripheral surface that comes in contact with the to-be-pivoted portion inserted into the pivot space and may rotatably engage the to-be-pivoted portion Further, a slit is formed in a leading end portion of the pivot stopper portion from the inner peripheral surface to the outer peripheral surface. The groove width of the slit in the tape front-back direction is set to be larger than the thickness of the insert plate portionIn the slide fastener  of Patent Document 1 with the separable bottom end stop  including the insert member  and the pivot stopper body , by inserting the to-be-pivoted portion of the insert member  into the pivot stopper body  from the side of the pivot stopper body  in the state in which the slider is held on the pivot stopper body , the to-be-pivoted portion is rotatably engaged with the pivot stopper portion of the pivot stopper body .Then, by rotating the insert member  centering on the to-be-pivoted portion toward the pivot stopper body  in the state in which the to-be-pivoted portion is engaged with the pivot stopper portion the insert plate portion of the insert member  is inserted into the element guide passage through a tape groove formed between the upper and lower flanges of the slider. Thereafter, by sliding the slider along the element rows  in a coupling direction, the coupling portion (hook portion) of the insert member  can be first engaged with the fastener element  adjacent to the pivot stopper body , and the left and right element rows  can be further coupled in order starting from the end portion at the separable bottom end stop  side.Meanwhile, in the slide fastener , even by inserting the to-be-pivoted portion of the insert member  into the pivot stopper body  from a shoulder mouth of the slider through the element guide passage of the slider in the state in which the slider (not shown) is held on the pivot stopper body , the to-be-pivoted portion is rotatably engaged with the pivot stopper portion of the pivot stopper body . Thereafter, by sliding the slider along the element rows  in the coupling direction, the left and right element rows  can be coupled in the same manner as described above.That is, in the slide fastener  of Patent Document 1, when coupling the left and right element rows , the insert member  can be rotatably engaged with the pivot stopper body  by arbitrarily selecting a first operation of engaging the insert member  with the pivot stopper body  by directly inserting the to-be-pivoted portion of the insert member  from the side of the pivot stopper body  or a second operation of engaging the insert member  with the pivot stopper body  by inserting the to-be-pivoted portion through the element guide passage of the slider, thereby improving operability and convenience of the slide fastener .Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2008-43568In the slide fastener  disclosed in Patent Document 1, the independent synthetic resin fastener element  formed by injection molding is disposed to sandwich the front and back tape surfaces of the fastener tape . Further, the independent fastener element  has the shape in which the front and back surface sides are symmetrical centering on the fastener tape . Thus, in the slide fastener , when coupling the left and right element rows , the left and right fastener elements  are firmly coupled at both the front tape surface side and the back tape surface side of the fastener tape .In this case, the insert member  and the pivot stopper body  that constitute the separable bottom end stop  are formed in the shape in which the front and back surface sides are symmetrical so as to sandwich the front and back tape surfaces of the fastener tape  similarly to the fastener element . Particularly, the insert member  and the pivot stopper body  can easily secure the thickness in the tape front-back direction, and thus, for example, even if the separable bottom end stop  receives pushing-up force in the tape front-back direction, the insert member  or the pivot stopper body  is not easily bent.For this reason, for example, even if the element rows  or the separable bottom end stop  receives pushing-up force in the tape front-back direction or lateral pulling force in the tape width direction in the state in which the left and right element rows  are coupled, the slide fastener  of Patent Document 1 can maintain the coupling state of the element rows and prevent the occurrence of decoupling.However, in the slide fastener having the element rows formed by the independent fastener elements  that are injection-molded as in Patent Document 1, since the fastener elements  are fixed while sandwiching the front and back tape surfaces of the fastener tape , there has been a problem in that flexibility of the slide fastener is lower than that of a slide fastener having element rows formed by coil- or zigzag-shaped continuous fastener elements.Meanwhile, for example, when the slide fastener having the element rows formed by the coil- or zigzag-shaped continuous fastener elements employs an insert member and a pivot stopper body as a separable bottom end stop as in Patent Document 1 and the separable bottom end stop is capable of engaging the insert member with the pivot stopper body by two different kinds of engagement operations, there has been a problem in that the element rows are easily decoupled when the separable bottom end stop receives pushing-up force.Specifically, in the slide fastener having the coil- or zigzag-shaped continuous fastener elements, the element rows are formed by sewing left and right continuous fastener elements to one surface (an upper surface) side of the fastener tape using a sewing thread.Further, the slider used in the slide fastener has the upper and lower flanges disposed on the left and right side edges of upper and lower blades, and the tape groove that the fastener tape passes through is formed between the upper and lower flanges.In this case, the tape grooves disposed on the left and right of the slider are formed such that the height positions of the tape grooves in the vertical direction are set closer to the lower blade side further than an intermediate portion between the upper and lower blades since the continuous fastener elements are sewed to the upper surface side of the fastener tape as described above. Further, in order to properly hold the posture of the continuous fastener elements and stably couple the left and right continuous fastener elements, the tape grooves are formed to have the groove width narrower than, for example, when the element row is formed by the independent fastener elements .For this reason, when the separable bottom end stop  having the insert member  and the pivot stopper body  illustrated in  is disposed in the slide fastener having such continuous fastener elements, the insert plate portion of the insert member  needs to be formed at a height dimension (the thickness), in the tape front-back direction, that is thin enough for the insert plate portion to be inserted into the tape groove of the slider. Further, in this case, since a gap between the tape groove and the lower blade of the slider is narrower than a gap between the tape groove and the upper blade, the thickness of the insert plate portion at the back tape surface side had to be thinner than that at the front tape surface side.However, when the thickness of the insert plate portion of the insert member  is thinly set as described above, the stiffness of the insert plate portion deteriorates. Thus, when the separable bottom end stop  receives lateral pulling force in the tape width direction or pushing-up force in the tape front-back direction in the state in which the element rows of the slide fastener are coupled, the insert plate portion is easily bent to shrink in the tape front-back direction. Particularly, since the back tape surface side is thinner in thickness than the front tape surface side, when lateral pulling force or pushing-up force is applied, the insert plate portion is easily bent to curve in a shape protruding to the back tape surface side.As a result, there occurs a phenomenon that the posture of the coupling portion of the insert member  is obliquely inclined with respect to the tape front-back direction or the position of the coupling portion shifts backward, leading to a problem in that engagement between the coupling portion and the continuous fastener element of the other coupling party is easily disengaged and the element rows of the slide fastener are easily decoupled starting from the end portion at the separable bottom end stop  side.The invention is made in light of the above described conventional problems, and a specific object of the invention is to provide a slide fastener with a separable bottom end stop in which an element row is formed by coil- or zigzag-shaped continuous fastener elements, a bottom end stop is capable of engaging an insert member with a pivot stopper body by two ways of operations, and a coupling state of the element rows is stably maintained even if the separable bottom end stop receives lateral pulling force or pushing-up force.In order to achieve the above object, the invention provides a slide fastener with a separable bottom end stop, including: a slider that passes through element rows each including coil- or zigzag-shaped continuous fastener elements fixed to opposing tape side edge portions of a pair of left and right fastener tapes; an insert member fixed to an end of one element row; and a pivot support member fixed to an end of the other element row, being characterized in that the insert member includes an insert plate portion of a thin plate form that is fixed to front and back tape surfaces of the fastener tape and has first and second surfaces, and a pivot shaft portion disposed to protrude on an end portion of the insert plate portion at a side opposite to the element row, the pivot support member includes first and second surfaces and includes a box pin portion that extends from an end of the element row to a tape end portion side in a tape length direction and holds the slider and a box portion that extends from the box pin portion, the box portion having a nearly J shape that allows the pivot shaft portion to be engageable and disengageable from a side of the pivot support member and to be engageable and disengageable through an element guide passage formed inside the slider, the pivot shaft portion is disposed to protrude only on the first surface of the insert plate portion, and the pivot support member includes a protrusion that extends toward a tape outer side from the first surface side of the box pin portion and supports the first surface side of the insert plate portion at the time of coupling of the element rows and a flat plate-like support portion that extends toward the tape outer side from the second surface side of the box portion and supports the second surface side of the insert plate portion at the time of coupling of the element rows.In the slide fastener with the separable bottom end stop according to the invention, it is preferable that the box portion extend from the box pin portion via a step portion, and that the flat plate-like support portion be disposed closer to the box portion side further than the position of the step portion and closer to the element row side further than the pivot shaft portion engaged with the pivot support member in the tape length direction and disposed closer to an inner side further than the position of an outer wall surface of the box portion at the pivot support member side and closer to the tape outer side further than the pivot shaft portion engaged with the pivot support member in the tape width direction.Furthermore, it is preferable that the insert member include a coupling portion, which is coupled with the continuous fastener element of the other coupling party, at a base end portion of the insert plate portion at the element row side, that the element row be sewed in a state in which a core thread is inserted into the continuous fastener element, and that an end of the core thread be buried inside the coupling portion.In this case, it is preferable that the coupling portion include a projection protruding toward the element row, and that the protrusion be formed close to the first surface side of the insert plate portion.Furthermore, it is preferable that the flat plate-like support portion support an end portion area including a second surface side of an end portion where the pivot shaft portion of the insert plate portion is formed.A slide fastener with a separable bottom end stop according to the invention includes left and right element rows that are formed by coil- or zigzag-shaped continuous fastener elements, an insert member fixed to an end of one element row, and a pivot support member fixed to an end of the other element row.In this case, the insert member includes an insert plate portion of a thin plate form that is fixed to front and back tape surfaces of a fastener tape and has first and second surfaces and a pivot shaft portion disposed to protrude only on the first surface of the insert plate portion. The pivot support member has first and second surfaces and includes a box pin portion that extends from an end of the element row to a tape end portion side in a tape length direction and holds the slider, a box portion having a nearly J shape that extends from the box pin portion, a protrusion that extends toward a tape outer side from a first surface side of the box pin portion in parallel to the insert plate portion, and a flat plate-like support portion that extends toward the tape outer side from a second surface side of the box portion in parallel to the insert plate portion.The slide fastener with the separable bottom end stop according to the invention is excellent in flexibility since the element rows are formed by the coil- or zigzag-shaped continuous fastener elements. Further, in the slide fastener, since the pivot shaft portion is disposed to protrude only on the first surface of the insert plate portion, even though the flat plate-like support portion is disposed at the second surface side of the box portion of the pivot support member, the flat plate-like support portion can be prevented from interfering with the insert member when the insert member is engaged with the pivot support member.Further, in the slide fastener, when engaging the insert member with the pivot support member and coupling the left and right element rows, the first surface side of the insert member is supported by the protrusion of the pivot support member, and the second surface side of the insert plate portion is supported by the flat plate-like support portion. As a result, when the separable bottom end stop including the insert member and the pivot support member receives lateral pulling force in the tape width direction or pushing-up force in the tape front-back direction, the protrusion of the pivot support member supports the first surface side of the insert plate portion, so that the insert plate portion can be prevented from being bent to curve in a shape protruding to the front tape surface side. Further, the flat plate-like support portion of the pivot support member supports the second surface side of the insert plate portion, so that the insert plate portion can be prevented from being bent to curve in a shape protruding to the back tape surface side.Thus, even if the separable bottom end stop receives lateral pulling force or pushing-up force, since the insert plate portion is prevented from being bent to curve, a relative position relationship between the insert member and the pivot support member can be stably maintained. Thus, the element rows are prevented from being decoupled from the end portion at the separable bottom end stop side, so that the coupling state of the element rows can be stably maintained.In the slide fastener with the separable bottom end stop according to the invention, the box portion extends from the box pin portion via a step portion, and the flat plate-like support portion is disposed closer to the box portion side further than the position of the step portion and closer to the element row side further than the pivot shaft portion engaged with the pivot support member in the tape length direction and disposed closer to an inner side further than the position of an outer wall surface of the box portion at the pivot support member side and closer to the tape outer side further than the pivot shaft portion engaged with the pivot support member in the tape width direction.In the slide fastener with the separable bottom end stop according to the invention, the insert member includes a coupling portion, which is coupled with the continuous fastener element of the other coupling party, at a base end portion of the insert plate portion at the element row side, the element row. is sewed in a state in which a core thread is inserted into the continuous fastener element, and an end of the core thread is buried inside the coupling portion.That is, in the slide fastener with the separable bottom end stop according to the invention, an end of the core thread inserted into the continuous fastener element is buried inside the coupling portion of the insert member, and the core thread remains excised in the insert plate portion. As a result, the continuous fastener element can be stably attached to the fastener tape, and the insert plate portion can be more thinly formed. Thus, an operation of inserting the insert plate portion into the tape groove of the slider can be smoothly and stably performed.In this case, the coupling portion includes a projection protruding toward the element row, and the projection is formed close to the first surface side of the insert plate portion. As a result, the projection disposed in the coupling portion can be easily engaged with the element row at the side where the pivot support member is formed, and thus the coupling strength of the left and right element rows can be improved.Further, in the slide fastener with the separable bottom end stop according to the invention, when engaging the insert member with the pivot support member and coupling the left and right element rows, the flat plate-like support portion supports an end portion area including a second surface side of an end portion where the pivot shaft portion of the insert plate portion is formed. As a result, the flat plate-like support portion can more stably support the second surface side of the insert plate portion, thereby preventing the insert plate portion from being bent with a high degree of certainty.Hereinafter, embodiments of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the embodiments and accompanying drawings. The invention is not limited to the following embodiments, and various changes can be made as long as substantially the same configuration and the same function effect as in the invention are provided.For example, in slide fasteners with a separable bottom end stop which will be described in the following embodiments, element rows are formed by sewing coil-shaped continuous fastener elements to tape side edge portions of left and right fastener tapes, but the invention is not limited thereto. The element rows may be formed by sewing zigzag-shaped continuous fastener elements to tape side edge portions of fastener tapes.is a front view illustrating a slide fastener with a separable bottom end stop according to the present first embodiment.  is a perspective view illustrating an insert member and a pivot support member of a separable bottom end stop disposed in the slide fastener, and  is a back view illustrating the insert member and the pivot support member of the separable bottom end stop.Further,  is a cross-sectional view illustrating a state in which a pivot shaft portion of the insert member is engaged with the pivot support member,  is a cross-sectional view illustrating a state in which the insert member is engaged with the pivot support member, and an insert plate portion of the insert member is inserted into a tape groove of a slider, and  is a front view illustrating a state in which left and right element rows are coupled. In , in order to illustrate the state of the slide fastener to be easily understood, a sewing thread for sewing continuous fastener elements to a fastener tape is not illustrated.In the present first embodiment and a second embodiment which will be described later, the following description is made under the assumption that a tape length direction of the fastener tape is a front-rear direction (the side at which a top stop is disposed is the front side, and the side at which a separable bottom end stop is disposed is the rear side), a tape width direction is a horizontal direction (the left portion when viewed from the front surface is the left side, and the right portion is the right side), a tape front-back direction is a vertical direction (the side at which continuous fastener elements are disposed on the fastener tape is the upper side, and the side opposite thereto is the lower side).A slide fastener  with a separable bottom end stop according to the present first embodiment includes a pair of left and right fastener stringers  on which element rows  are formed, a separable bottom end stop  attached to one end of the element rows  of the fastener stringers , and a slider  that couples or decouples the left and right element rows .The fastener stringers  of the present first embodiment are formed by sewing coil-shaped continuous fastener elements  to upper surface sides of opposing tape side edge portions of left and right fastener tapes . The element rows  of the left and right fastener stringers  are formed by sewing the continuous fastener elements  to the upper surfaces of the fastener tapes  using a sewing thread  in the state in which a core thread  is inserted into the coil-shaped continuous fastener elements .Further, the core thread  inserted into the right continuous fastener elements  extends more downward than the lower end of the right element row  and is buried inside a pivot support member  of the separable bottom end stop  which will be described later. Meanwhile, the core thread  inserted into the left continuous fastener elements  is disposed up to the position of a coupling portion of the insert member  of the separable bottom end stop  which will be described later, and the rear end of the core thread  is buried inside the coupling portion Thus, the core thread  remains excised in an area of an insert plate portion of the insert member  which will be described later, and the core thread  is not disposed inside the insert plate portionThe coil-shaped continuous fastener element  is obtained by forming a synthetic resin monofilament in a coil shape. The fastener element  includes a coupling head that is coupled with or decoupled from the fastener element  of the other party, a pair of upper and lower leg portions that extend from the coupling head in one direction (to the tape inner side), and a connecting portion that connects the leg portions of neighboring elements with each other. Here, a leg portion disposed at the upper side is referred to as an upper leg portion, and a leg portion disposed at the lower side is referred to as a lower leg portion. Since the element row  is formed by the coil-shaped fastener elements , the flexibility of the element row can be easily secured.Further, top stops  are fixed to upper end portions of the left and right element rows , respectively. Further, reinforcement portions  are formed on the front and back surfaces of the lower end portions of the fastener tapes  in the tape length direction by adhering a synthetic resin film.As the slider , the same one as the typical slider  used in the conventional slide fastener  having the coil-shaped continuous fastener element  is used. The slider  includes upper and lower blades and a connecting post that connects the upper and lower blades and at a front end portion of the slider , upper and lower flanges disposed at the left and right side edges of the upper and lower blades and a locking pawl that is disposed on the upper blade and capable of stopping the slider  by engaging with the element row , a tab attaching post erected on the front surface of the upper blade and a tab attached to the tab attaching postFurther, on an end portion (a front end portion) where the connecting post of the slider  is disposed, shoulder mouths are formed on the left and right of the connecting post and a rear mouth is formed on an end portion (a rear end portion) at the opposite side. An element guide passage that allows the left and right shoulder mouths to communicate with the rear mouth and has a nearly Y shape in a front view is disposed in the slider . A partition (not shown) for stabilizing the position of the fastener element  passing through the element guide passage is formed inside the element guide passage The partition is configured with a projecting portion formed on the surfaces (the inner surfaces) of the upper and lower blades and at the element guide passage side.Further, tape grooves that allow the fastener tapes  to pass through when the slider  slides along the element rows  are disposed between the upper and lower flanges of the slider , and the left and right tape grooves of the slider  are set closer to the lower blade side further than the intermediate position between the upper and lower blades and in the vertical direction (the height direction).That is, since the element rows  of the left and right fastener stringers  are disposed only on the upper surface sides of the fastener tapes , by disposing the tape grooves of the slider  near the lower blade a gap between the lower blade of the slider  and the lower tape surface of the fastener tape  can decrease when the slider  slides to couple or decouple the left and right element rows . As a result, the continuous fastener element  is prevented from tilting (turning) inside the element guide passage of the slider  in a direction orthogonal to the tape length direction, and thus the posture of the continuous fastener element  can be stabilized. Accordingly, coupling or decoupling of the left and right element rows  can be smoothly performed.The separable bottom end stop  of the present first embodiment is integrally formed at the lower end portion of the fastener tape  by injection-molding thermoplastic resin such as polyacetal or polyamide on the fastener tape . The bottom end stop  includes the insert member  disposed at the tape side edge portion of the left fastener tape  and the pivot support member  disposed at the tape side edge portion of the right fastener tape .The insert member  of the separable bottom end stop  continues from the lower end edge of the left element row  and is formed to sandwich the front and back tape surfaces of the fastener tape . The insert member  includes an insert plate portion of a thin plate form fixed to the front and back tape surfaces of the fastener tape , a pivot shaft portion disposed to protrude at an angular portion of the insert plate portion at the rear end side, a coupling portion disposed on a base end portion (a front end portion) of the insert plate portion at the element row  side, and first and second projecting portions and respectively formed along tape inner side edge portions of the front and back surfaces of the insert plate portion In this case, the front surface (the upper surface) of the insert plate portion is referred to as a first surface, and the back surface (the lower surface) is referred to as a second surface.The insert plate portion of the insert member  has the front and back surfaces formed in a flat thin plate form, and the thickness of the insert plate portion is set to be smaller than the size of the groove width of the tape groove of the slider  (the gap between the upper and lower flanges ) and also set to be smaller than a dimension of the element row  in the vertical direction.Particularly, in the present first embodiment, the core thread  is not disposed in the insert plate portion as described above. For this reason, the thickness of the insert plate portion can become easily thinner than the groove width of the tape groove, and since the insert plate portion is not divided by the core thread , the strength or stiffness of the insert plate portion can increase. Further, the core thread  gets stuck into the inside of the coupling portionThe insert plate portion is inserted into the element guide passage through the tape groove disposed close to the lower blade of the slider  as will be described later when pivot-supporting the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  to the pivot stopper body . Thus, the lower surface portion of the insert plate portion disposed at the lower tape surface side is thinner in thickness than the upper surface portion disposed at the upper tape surface side.The pivot shaft portion of the insert member  is disposed at the angular portion of the tape outer side (the pivot support member opposing side edge side) at the rear end side of the insert plate portion (the upper surface of the insert plate portion and the end portion side opposite to the element row  side) and is disposed to protrude only on the upper surface of the insert plate portion for example, unlike the to-be-pivoted portion (the pivot shaft portion) (see ) that is disposed to protrude on both of the upper and lower surfaces of the insert plate portion as in Patent Document 1. In this case, a height dimension (the thickness) in the tape front-back direction from the lower surface of the insert plate portion to the upper surface of the pivot shaft portion is set to be smaller than the gap between the upper and lower blades and of the slider  and larger than the tape groove of the slider .The pivot shaft portion is formed in a nearly cylindrical shape, but a side wall surface of the pivot shaft portion is formed by a cylindrical surface a first flat surface that is disposed at the tape inner side of the pivot shaft portion and in parallel to the tape length direction, and a second flat surface that curves from the first flat surface and is inclined so that a dimension of the pivot shaft portion in the tape width direction gradually decreases backward.The first and second projecting portions and of the insert member  are formed along the tape inner side edges of the insert plate portion protruding from the front surface and the back surface of the insert plate portion respectively. By forming the first and second projecting portions and it is possible to increase the stiffness of the insert plate portionIn the lower end portion of the first projecting portion disposed on the front surface of the insert plate portion and the lower end portion of the second projecting portion disposed on the back surface of the insert plate portion escape portions are disposed at the insert plate portion side to be cut out toward the tape inner side from the side surface, and a width dimension (a dimension in the tape width direction) of the rear end portions of the first and second projecting portions and is smaller than a width dimension of the front end portions thereof.Further, the escape portion disposed in the second projecting portion is formed to be larger in tape length direction than the escape portion disposed in the first projecting portion and the front end position of the escape portion disposed in the second projecting portion is disposed closer to an element row side (a front side) further than the front end of the escape portion disposed in the first projecting portion By disposing the escape portions in the first and second projecting portions and as will be described later, when the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  is pivot-supported on the pivot support member , or when the insert member  rotates on the pivot shaft portion engaged with the pivot support member  toward the pivot support member  side, the first and second projecting portions and are prevented from interfering with a box portion and a flat plate-like support portion of the pivot support portion  which will be described later.The coupling portion of the insert member  sandwiches the front and back tape surfaces of the fastener tape  and is formed integrally with the insert plate portion Even in the coupling portion similarly to the insert plate portion a portion of the coupling portion disposed at the lower tape surface side is set to be thinner in thickness than a portion disposed at the upper tape surface side.The coupling portion includes a step surface on which the fastener element  of the other coupling party can be placed when the left and right element rows  are coupled, a projection of a truncated quadrangular pyramid shape protruding forward (toward the element row) from the step surface and a concave portion that is recessed along the pivot support member opposing side edge of the coupling portion at the lower surface side. In the present first embodiment, as illustrated in , the projection of the coupling portion is formed to be biased closer to the upper surface side (the first surface side) of the insert plate portion of the thin plate form.Since the projection is formed in the coupling portion as described above, when coupling the left and right element rows , the projection can be stably inserted into between the upper and lower leg portions of the fastener element  of the other coupling party placed on the step surface and the coupling portion can be easily engaged with the fastener element . Accordingly, the coupling strength of the separable bottom end stop  side end portions of the left and right element rows  can increase.Further, since the concave portion is formed in the coupling portion it can be avoided that the coupling portion of the insert member  interferes with the partition disposed inside the element guide passage of the slider , for example, when the insert plate portion of the insert member  is inserted into the slider  after the slider  is held on a box pin portion of the pivot support member  which will be described later.In the present first embodiment, the pivot support member  of the separable bottom end stop  continues from the lower end edge of the right element row  and is formed to sandwich the front and back tape surfaces of the fastener tape . The pivot support member  includes the box pin portion formed to sandwich the front and back surfaces of the right fastener tape , a box portion that is formed at a thickness thicker than the box pin portion from the rear end of the box pin portion via a first step portion and has a nearly J shape in a front view, a protrusion that extends toward the tape outer side from the first surface side (the upper surface side) of the box pin portion through a second step portion at a thickness thinner than the box pin portion and a flat plate-like support portion that extends to the second surface side (the lower surface side) of the box portionThe box pin portion of the pivot support member  has a height dimension (the thickness) in the tape front-back direction that is set to be larger than the groove width of the tape groove of the slider  (the gap between the upper and lower flanges ) and smaller than a height dimension of the element guide passage of the slider  (the gap between the upper and lower blades and ). The box pin portion is formed to be inserted into the element guide passage of the slider  and hold the slider  when the slider  slides along the element rows  up to the position where the slider  abuts on the first step portion of the pivot support member .Further, in order to avoid that the partition (not shown) of the slider  interferes with the box pin portion and the protrusion when the slider  is held on the box pin portion a slope portion that is inclined toward its front end edge is formed at the upper surface side of the box pin portion and the protrusion (see ). Further, a concave portion is formed, at an insert member opposing side edge of the box pin portion at the lower surface side, to be recessed along the tape length direction.The box portion of the pivot support member  extends from the box pin portion to the tape end edge portion and has a nearly J shape in the front view that is formed to curve toward the insert member  side from the tape end edge portion and allows the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  to be engaged or disengaged through the side of the pivot support member . In this case, the box portion includes a space portion formed to receive the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  from the side of the pivot support member  when the slider  is held on the box pin portion and an inner wall surface that rotatably engages the pivot shaft portion inserted through the space portionThe inner wall surface of the box portion includes a first sliding surface that slidingly contacts on the first flat surface of the pivot shaft portion when the pivot shaft portion is pivot-supported and a second sliding surface that slidingly contacts the second flat surface of the pivot shaft portion In this case, the first sliding surface is disposed in parallel to the tape length direction. The second sliding surface is formed to curve from the first sliding surface and to be inclined with respect to the tape length direction.Further, a slit having the groove width larger than the thickness of the insert plate portion is formed on a leading end portion of the box portion at the curved side to allow the insert plate portion of the insert member  to be inserted into. The slit is disposed at the lower surface side of the box portion so that the slit can be penetrated from the outer wall surface to the inner wall surface of the box portion and a portion of the inner wall surface below the slit is formed by the upper surface of the flat plate-like support portionThe protrusion of the pivot support member  extends toward the tape outer side from the insert member opposing side edge of the box pin portion to the upper surface side of the box pin portion via the second step portion in parallel to the upper tape surface and the lower tape surface of the fastener tape  at a thickness thinner than the box pin portion In this case, the second step portion is formed along the tape length direction.The protrusion is disposed behind the position of the coupling portion of the insert member  and ahead of the box portion of the pivot support member  in the tape length direction when the left and right element rows  are coupled. Further, when the element rows  are coupled, the protrusion is superimposed on the insert plate portion of the insert member  in the tape front-back direction, and the lower surface of the protrusion can come in surface contact with the upper surface of the insert plate portionThe flat plate-like support portion of the pivot support member  is formed at the lower surface side of the box portion in parallel to the upper tape surface and the lower tape surface of the fastener tape . The flat plate-like support portion is disposed closer to the rear side further than the position of the first step portion (the end portion side of the box portion ) in the tape length direction and disposed closer to the inner side, which is the fastener tape  side, further than the position of the leading end portion outer wall surface of the box portion in the tape width direction. Further, the flat plate-like support portion is disposed closer to the element row  side further than the pivot shaft portion and disposed to extend closer to the tape outer side further than the pivot shaft portion when the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  is engaged with the pivot support member . That is, the flat plate-like support portion is formed to have a nearly rectangular shape when viewed from the front surface.Further, in the present first embodiment, the front end surface of the flat plate-like support portion is disposed in parallel to the tape width direction and is on the same plane surface as the stepped surface of the first step portion Further, the left side surface of the flat plate-like support portion (the side surface opposite to the second projecting portion of the insert member  when the insert member  is engaged with the pivot support member ) is on the same plane surface as the leading end portion outer wall surface of the box portionNext, an operation of closing the slide fastener  with the separable bottom end stop having the above described configuration according to the present first embodiment will be described.First, by sliding the slider  toward the pivot support member  along the element row  disposed in the right fastener stringer , the rear mouth side end portion (the rear end portion) of the slider  abuts on the front end surfaces of the first step portion and the flat plate-like support portion of the pivot support member , and the slider  is held on the box pin portionAt this time, since the slope portion is formed in the box pin portion and the protrusion of the pivot support member , when the slider  slides to abut on the front end surfaces of the first step portion and the flat plate-like support portion the locking pawl of the slider  can smoothly ride on the upper surfaces of the box pin portion and the protrusion Further, since the slope portion is formed, the box pin portion and the protrusion can be prevented from interfering with the partition of the slider . Further, since the front end surface of the flat plate-like support portion is disposed in parallel to the tape width direction as described above, as the slider  abuts on the front end surface of the flat plate-like support portion the posture of the slider  can be straightly maintained in the tape length direction.Subsequently, by having the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  disposed in the left fastener stringer  abut on the inner wall surface of the box portion through the space portion of the pivot support member , the pivot shaft portion is pivot-supported on the box portion (see ). At this time, in the slide fastener  of the present first embodiment, an operation of pivot-supporting the pivot shaft portion on the box portion may be performed by arbitrarily selecting one of the following two kinds of methods.First, as a first operation method, by guiding the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  from the left side of the pivot support member  and inserting the pivot shaft portion to the inner wall surface of the box portion through the space portion between the box portion and the slider , as illustrated in , the pivot shaft portion can abut on the inner wall surface of the box portion and be pivot-supported on the box portionAt this time, in the slide fastener  of the present first embodiment, since the pivot shaft portion is disposed to protrude only on the upper surface of the insert plate portion even though the flat plate-like support portion extends to the lower surface side of the box portion the insert member  does not interfere with the flat plate-like support portion when pivot-supporting the pivot shaft portion on the box portionFurther, since the slit is disposed in the leading end portion of the box portion when pivot-supporting the pivot shaft portion on the box portion by inserting the insert plate portion of the insert member  into the slit the insert plate portion can be prevented from interfering with the box portion In this case, by having the lower surface of the insert plate portion slidingly contact the upper surface of the flat plate-like support portion the pivot shaft portion can be smoothly guided to and pivot-supported on the box portionAfter the pivot shaft portion is pivot-supported on the box portion by rotating the insert member  centering on the pivot shaft portion toward the pivot support member , the insert plate portion of the insert member  is inserted into the element guide passage from the tape groove of the slider . At this time, the insert member  rotates until the insert plate portion abuts on the connecting post of the slider  or reaches the position near the connecting post As a result, a relative position relationship between the insert member  and the pivot support member  can be set to the state in which coupling of the element rows  can stably start as illustrated in .Meanwhile, as a second operation method, by inserting the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  into the space portion of the pivot support member  from the left side shoulder mouth of the slider  via the element guide passage and having the pivot shaft portion abut on the inner wall surface of the box portion the pivot shaft portion can be pivot-supported on the box portion As a result, similarly to the above described first operation method, a relative position relationship between the insert member  and the pivot support member  can be set to the state in which coupling of the element rows  can stably start as illustrated in .After the insert member  and the pivot support member  are held with a predetermined position relationship using the first operation method or the second operation method, the slider  slides forward, that is, in the element coupling direction. As a result, the projection disposed in the coupling portion of the insert member  is inserted into between the upper and lower leg portions of the right fastener element  adjacent to the pivot support member  (hereinafter, the fastener element  is referred to as a first fastener element ), the coupling portion is engaged with the first fastener element and the left and right element rows  are coupled in order starting from the first fastener element whereby the slide fastener  can be easily closed.The slide fastener  of the present first embodiment in which the left and right element rows  are coupled becomes the state in which the protrusion of the pivot support member  is superimposed on the upper surface of the pivot support member opposing side edge portion of the insert plate portion of the insert member  in the tape front-back direction, and the lower surface of the protrusion comes in surface contact with the upper surface of the insert plate portion as illustrated in .A rear end portion area including an opposite surface side (the second surface side) of the angular portion where the pivot shaft portion of the insert plate portion is disposed is supported from the lower surface side by the flat plate-like support portion extending in parallel to the insert plate portion Further, since the rear end portion area is inserted into the slit of the box portion a part of the rear end portion area is supported from the upper surface side by the leading end portion of the box portion The rear end portion area refers to an area, at the rear end side, that includes the lower surface side (the second surface side) of the angular portion where at least the pivot shaft portion is disposed in the insert plate portion and is directed toward the tape inner side from the angular portion.That is, in the state in which the left and right element rows  are coupled, the thin plate-like insert plate portion of the insert member  is supported from the vertical direction to be sandwiched by the protrusion of the pivot support member , the flat plate-like support portion and the leading end portion of the box portion As a result, even if the separable bottom end stop  receives, for example, lateral pulling force in the tape width direction or pushing-up force in the tape front-back direction, the protrusion of the pivot support member  is superimposed in a state facing the upper surface of the insert plate portion to support the insert plate portion and the leading end portion of the box portion supports the insert plate portion from the upper surface side.For this reason, even if the insert plate portion tends to be bent to curve in a shape protruding toward the upper surface side, since the protrusion comes in surface contact with the insert plate portion the insert plate portion can be prevented from being deformed any more. Further, since the flat plate-like support portion of the pivot support member  supports the second surface side of the insert plate portion even if the insert plate portion tends to be bent to curve in a shape protruding toward the lower surface side, the insert plate portion can be prevented from being deformed.As described above, in the slide fastener  of the present first embodiment, even if the separable bottom end stop  receives lateral pulling force or pushing-up force, since the insert plate portion can be prevented from being bent in the vertical direction, the relative position or posture of the coupling portion disposed on the upper end portion of the insert plate portion can be stably held. Accordingly, engagement between the coupling portion and the first fastener element at the right side can be stably maintained, and it is possible to prevent the element rows  from being decoupled from the end portion at the separable bottom end stop  side.Further, in the slide fastener  of the present first embodiment, since the fastener elements  are sewed to the upper surface side of the fastener tape  and the tape groove of the slider  is formed close to the lower blade as described above, the lower blade is disposed, at a position closer to the tape surface of the fastener tape  than the upper blade Thus, the protrusion protruding toward the tape outer side from the box pin portion can be disposed on the upper surface side (the first surface) of the box pin portion as described above, but a protrusion cannot be disposed on the lower surface (the second surface) side of the box pin portion since a sufficient space does not remain between the lower blade of the slider  and the tape surface of the fastener tape . That is, the protrusion extending from the box pin portion can support the insert plate portion from the upper surface side but cannot support the insert plate portion from the lower surface side. In this case, the lower surface of the insert plate portion is supported by the flat plate-like support portion as described above. Thus, even if the separable bottom end stop  receives lateral pulling force or pushing-up force, the coupling state of the element rows  can be stably maintained.Particularly, in the slide fastener  of the present first embodiment, when the left and right element rows  are in the coupling state, the first flat surface of the pivot shaft portion is spaced apart from the first sliding surface of the box portion and the second flat surface of the pivot shaft portion comes in surface contact with the second sliding surface of the box portion Thus, for example, when the separable bottom end stop  receives lateral pulling force, the pivot shaft portion relatively moves diagonally to the upper left along the second sliding surface of the box portion so as to reduce the distance between the first flat surface of the pivot shaft portion and the first sliding surface of the box portion and thus the insert member  moves to be pushed up forward with respect to the pivot support member .As a result, since the projection of the coupling portion is more deeply inserted into between the upper and lower leg portions of the first fastener element the coupling portion can be more firmly engaged with the first fastener element Thus, the slide fastener  of the present first embodiment can prevent the occurrence of decoupling with a high degree of certainty even if the separable bottom end stop  receives lateral pulling force.Further, the separable bottom end stop  receives lateral pulling force, the pivot shaft portion moves along the second sliding surface of the box portion as described above, and the first flat surface of the pivot shaft portion comes in surface contact with the first sliding surface of the box portion Thus, the position of the pivot shaft portion can be stably held, and it is possible to prevent the pivot shaft portion from getting out of the box portionFurther, in the slide fastener  of the present first embodiment, in order to decouple the left and right element rows  and open the slide fastener , first by sliding the slider  toward the separable bottom end stop  along the element rows , the rear end portion of the slider  abuts on the front end surfaces of the first step portion and the flat plate-like support portion of the pivot support member , and the slider  is held on the box pin portion As a result, the left and right element rows  are decoupled, and engagement between the coupling portion of the insert member  and the first fastener element is also released.Thereafter, the insert member  rotates centering on the pivot shaft portion counterclockwise to be apart from the pivot support member . As a result, the insert plate portion of the insert member  is pulled out of the element guide passage of the slider . As the insert member  further rotates, as illustrated in , the lower end of the first projecting portion disposed at the upper surface side of the insert plate portion contacts the box portion and the lower end of the second projecting portion disposed on the lower surface side contacts the flat plate-like support portion Thereafter, the insert member  rotates counterclockwise using the contact points as a support point. Thus, the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  is easily extracted from the box portion in the left direction through the space portion between the rear end portion of the slider  and the leading end portion of the box portion at the curved side, and thus the slide fastener  can be smoothly opened.In the present first embodiment, when extracting the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  from the box portion the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  may be extracted from the space portion through the element guide passage of the slider  instead of being extracted through the above described space portion in the left direction.is a front view illustrating a pivot support member of a slide fastener with a separable bottom end stop according to a second embodiment of the invention.In the present second embodiment, parts or members having the same configuration as the parts or members described in the first embodiment are denoted by the same symbols, and thus a description thereof will not be repeated.In a slide fastener  of the present second embodiment, a pivot support member  is formed such that a front end surface of a flat plate-like support portion has an inclined surface that is inclined downward to the rear end side as it gets away from the fastener tape  in the tape width direction. Further, in the slide fastener  of the present second embodiment, the remaining configuration except the front end surface of the flat plate-like support portion is basically the same as in the slide fastener  of the first embodiment.In the slide fastener  of the present second embodiment, since the slider  is held on the box pin portion and the rear end of the slider  comes in surface contact with the first step portion of the pivot support member , the posture of the slider  can be straightly maintained in the tape length direction similarly to the first embodiment. Further, by having the rear end of the slider  come in surface contact with the front end surface of the flat plate-like support portion the posture of the slider  can be maintained to a state inclined counterclockwise with respect to the tape length direction in a front view as illustrated in .As a result, for example, in the case of using the first operation method (that is, the case of inserting the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  from the left side of the pivot support member ) so as to pivot-support the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  on the box portion of the pivot support member , by having the rear end of the slider  come in surface contact with the first step portion of the pivot support member , the posture of the slider  is straightly maintained in the tape length direction, and thus the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  can be smoothly inserted toward the box portion of the pivot support member  and pivot-supported on the box portionMeanwhile, for example, in the case of using the second operation method (that is, the case of inserting the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  through the element guide passage of the slider ) so as to pivot-support the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  on the box portion of the pivot support member , by having the rear end of the slider  come in surface contact with the front end surface of the flat plate-like support portion the posture of the slider  is maintained in the inclined state, and thus the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  can be smoothly inserted toward the box portion of the pivot support member  and pivot-supported on the box portionThat is, in the slide fastener  of the present second embodiment, it is possible to easily change the posture of the slider  according to the operation method of pivot-supporting the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  on the box portion As a result, the operation of pivot-supporting the pivot shaft portion of the insert member  on the box portion can be more smoothly performed, and thus the operability of the slide fastener  can be further improved."

                "The invention relates to an attachment buckle comprising a base provided with a hook for attaching a retaining ring, and control means able to occupy a locking position and a releasing position to respectively secure and release the retaining ring on and from the latching hook, the control means comprising two locking elements independent from one another and both having a stop and a control button.The fixing buckle is connected to a strap of a belt or to a harness for climbing, caving or for working at a height. For safety reasons, any untimely opening of the buckle has to be impossible.The document EP 1465507 describes a fixing buckle with self-locking comprising a single control button movable between a closed position and an open position, and a swivelling latch to lock the control button in the closed position. The latch is arranged in the central part of the buckle, and the button is provided with a tab forming a stop which retracts when the ring is inserted on the latching hook. Opening of the buckle under tension is impossible.Opening command of the buckle has to be performed without any load and requires two distinct consecutive actions:The actuating movements necessary for opening require a certain time, as it is necessary to first unlock the latch, to press on the button, and then to remove the ring while at the same time taking one's finger off.The document DE 249673 relates to a fixing buckle with two locking elements arranged in alignment in the transverse direction, the buttons of which elements are salient on each side of the buckle. Such an arrangement of the buttons does not enable reliable securing of the buckle to be guaranteed.The object of the invention consists in providing a buckle for fixing a ring that is of reliable structure, that is easy to release using both hands when the buckle is not on load, and preventing any involuntary releasing in normal use with no hands.The fixing buckle according to the invention is characterized in that the locking elements are formed by two levers pivotally mounted inside the cover, the stop being arranged at one of the ends of each lever and the control button being arranged at the other end thereof, detachment of the ring being enabled when on no load and when the buttons of the two levers are actuated simultaneously to the releasing position.The retaining ring remains captive in the latching hook and any untimely opening of the fixing buckle is impossible without action on the lateral buttons. Double locking of the retaining ring in the fixing buckle is thereby obtained. Deliberate or involuntary actuation of a single button is not sufficient to remove the ring from the latching hook.According to a preferred embodiment, the two locking elements are arranged symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal mid-plane. The locking elements are housed inside a cover fixed to the base and comprising two lateral apertures for access to the control buttons. The lever of each locking element is pivotally mounted around an inclined axis enabling offset pivoting, the two levers being arranged symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal mid-plane.According to one feature of the invention, a bias spring is associated with each pivoting lever to bias the latter to the raised locking position.The lever of each locking element can be provided with a ramp on which the retaining ring presses when the latter is inserted in the latching hook.In the figures, a fixing buckle  comprises a metal base  provided with a latching hook  at the front part thereof. Hook  is designed to receive a retaining ring  to which an attachment strap , for example of a belt or a harness, is connected. The rear part of base  is in the form of a clamp provided with means for adjusting the length of the attachment strap .Base  is fixed to a cover  which partially covers the top surface of base  except for the insertion zone Z of retaining ring  in latching hook .Cover  is equipped with control means able to occupy a locking position and a releasing position to respectively secure and release retaining ring  in and from introduction zone Z. These control means comprise two locking elements EV, EV independent from one another and positioned symmetrically on each side of the longitudinal mid-plane of buckle .In the described example, the two locking elements EV, EV are formed by two levers  pivotally mounted around inclined axes . Each lever  has a stop  at one end thereof and a control button  at the other end thereof. The two stops  are located facing latching hook  and move in introduction zone Z if the two buttons  are actuated. The two buttons  are accessible being housed in two apertures  provided laterally in cover . The two buttons  simply have to be pressed to the depressed releasing position to make the two stops  retract.A bias spring  is fitted on each pivoting axis  of the two locking elements EV, EV to bias the latter to the raised locking position.A ramp  on which retaining ring  presses when the latter is inserted in latching hook  is arranged above stop  of each locking element EV, EV.Operation of the fixing buckle  according to the invention is as follows:To hook retaining ring  on latching hook  of buckle , the ring simply has to be pressed on ramps  of the two locking elements EV, EV exerting a certain pressure. This results in manual releasing driving stops  to the depressed releasing position. Retaining ring  can enter introduction zone Z hooking onto latching hook , and stops  automatically return to the raised locking position. Retaining ring  remains captive in latching hook , and any untimely opening of fixing buckle  is impossible without any action on the lateral buttons .Double locking of retaining ring  in fixing buckle  is thereby achieved. Deliberate or involuntary actuation of a single button  is not sufficient to remove ring  from latching hook .When fixing buckle  is under load due to the tension of the strap, any releasing of retaining ring  is also disabled, even by actuating the two buttons  in the releasing direction.Opening command of fixing buckle  can only be performed if:For the releasing command, the two lateral buttons  simply have to be moved towards one another by means of the thumb and index finger of a single hand. Pivoting of levers  takes place in offset manner resulting in a downward vertical component, i.e. in the releasing direction.It is clear that pivoting levers  of the two locking elements EV, EV can be replaced by equivalent means, in particular tabs movable by translation, or push-buttons arranged side by side."

                "The present disclosure relates to a device for use with a container or vessel or other object and, more particularly, to a device for use with a bottle to assist in securing such bottle to a belt, belt loop, strap, hook or other hanging device while not in use and further allowing the securing of objects such as keys and key rings, and further allowing addition of personalizing accessories to the subject device.It is often advantageous to have a means of conveniently securing bottles, keys, key rings and other objects in a readily accessible location yet without requiring the use of appendages to hold such items. Generally, there are applications which address these needs independently; e.g. there may be a clip to secure a bottle or other container, and there may be a clip to secure key(s) or a key-ring.In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous to provide one clip which can conveniently secure a bottle or other container or object, while at the same time securing another object such as key(s), a key-ring or other object which may conveniently fit. Further, to allow the user to personalize the device as (s)he sees fit, it is advantageous to provide a means to easily decorate or personalize the device with an accessory or accessories.Efforts have been devoted in the prior art to developing devices and/or systems for securing bottles to carabiner clips and similar clips. U.S. Design Patent No. D491,465 describes a ring which attaches to a bottle neck and to a clip. There are also effort devoted in the prior art to developing devices and/or systems for securing key(s) and or key ring(s); Lucky Line Products, Inc. manufactures such items including its “Quik Clip”. There are also efforts devoted in the prior art to developing devices and/or systems to allow personalizing objects with other objects, such as those known as “Jibbitz” for use with shoes known as “Crocs.”Despite the efforts referenced hereinabove, a need remains for advantageous devices that conveniently combine these features.The present disclosure is directed to a device for securing a bottle, vessel or other container, and/or a key ring, to a belt, belt loop, strap, hook, and the like, and which has a means to allow personalizing decoration at the tab end of the device, particularly through insertion of an accessory through an open slot. The disclosed device may be advantageously employed in a variety of applications where it is desired to secure containers, keys, and/or key rings so that the user is not required to hold them in hand or pocket or bag while not in use, thus freeing use of hand(s) and increasing available space in pocket or bag as well as securing containers and keys in a more convenient and readily accessible location. The disclosed device may also be pre-mounted to a container/vessel/bottle, e.g., in the manufacturing process. In such circumstance, the present disclosure is directed to the container/vessel/bottle in combination with such advantageous device.Additional features, benefits and functionalities associated with devices and bottle/key clips according to the present disclosure will be apparent from the detailed description which follows.The device of the present disclosure advantageously secures either keys or bottle or other container, or both, and further allows addition of a personalizing accessory in a slot at the tab. The device may be provided as a free standing item, e.g., an accessory unit/assembly for independent purchase and use, or as part of an integrated product offering, e.g., permanently or detachably secured to a container, vessel or bottle. The disclosed device may be employed in a variety of applications, e.g., to secure keys, key rings, bottles and the like.In an exemplary application of the present disclosure, the device may be employed in connection with securing a bottle and/or keys without holding them directly or storing them in another conveyance, such as a bag, pocket, and the like. The disclosed device allows the user to conveniently hang the device and secured item(s) in a more readily accessible or preferred location. The disclosed device is advantageously sized and dimensioned to be utilized with most standard size bottles, key rings and personalizing accessories, as are known in the art. Adjustments to the size and/or dimensions of the disclosed device and its components may be made to facilitate use with non-conventionally sized fluid bottles, key rings, and other accessories, as is apparent from the detailed description provided herein.With reference to , an exemplary bottle and key clip device  according to the present disclosure is depicted for use, showing an optional interior hook  to receive keys or key ring  (), a flexible ring  which fits around the neck of a conventional bottle neck  (as shown in ), and a flexible opening and closing clip  which attaches to a belt, loop, strap, or other hanging apparatus. A tab  which may be used to help pull flexible ring  onto and off bottle neck  may optionally have a slot  to receive a personalizing accessory  as shown in , as is known in the art. Bottle and key clip device  may be used, inter alia, as a bottle clip, key clip, or both.With reference to bottle and key clip device , the overall assembly generally includes two (2) distinct components as shown in : clip  and flexible ring . With further reference to , when the center area of clip  is squeezed inwardly, a separation occurs at location  allowing keys, key rings and other items to slide into clip  and further allows bottle and key clip  to fit through a belt, loop, strap or other similar hanging device by allowing such belt, loop, strap or other hanging device to travel through the opening created at location . When the squeezing or inwardly directed pressure is removed, opening  reverts to its sealed position.shows bottle and key clip  hanging from belt loop , with flexible ring  around neck  of bottle ; key ring  is captured within interior hook  and further shows the attached personalizing accessory .In an alternative embodiment, with reference to , bottle and key clip device  may be formed without interior hook . In such a case, the keys or key ring would rest against ring  in the area where interior hook  would otherwise have been, or against ring  on the other side, opposite where interior hook  would otherwise have been.In a further alternative embodiment, hook  could be located elsewhere on the interior or even on exterior edge of clip .In a further alternative embodiment, with reference to , tab  may be formed without slot , i.e. solid, and be decorated with stickers, graphics, inks, dyes or other applied decorations.In a further alternative embodiment, with reference to  and , flexible ring  may be formed with tab  and be more advantageously shaped with oblong attachment area  and  to fit a non-rounded, e.g., oblong-edged, clip such as clip  shown in . Assembly of an oblong-edged clip, such as clip  with a flexible ring  including oblong-shaped areas  and , would be more easily facilitated with an oblong opening  rather than a round opening; oblong-edged clips such as clip  would slide more easily through oblong opening  without the added tension, resistance and friction encountered in stretching a round opening typically found in the current art. Tab  may optionally include opening  in order to receive a personalizing accessory . Tab  may also optionally include, either with or without opening , a recessed edge or rim  which may receive and secure the edges of an accessory piece which may be a personalized image, photo or other two-dimensional or three-dimensional design on paper, plastic or in other material, which would be mounted and displayed in area  and which may or may not also include clear plastic cover(s) to protect said image or design.

                "This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/360,286 filed Jun. 30, 2010 which, in its entirety, is hereby incorporated herein by reference.This invention relates to the tensioning of lines, ropes, webbing, elastic cables, and other flexible elongated elements used to tie down cargo, hoisting, and other similar applications.This invention relates to a simple and inexpensive device for enabling the tie down of lines, ropes or elastic cables to be quickly and easily attached, tensioned, and reliably fixed in place under tension, while also enabling them to be quickly and easily released. It also relates to a tie down device that maintains tension of the load even upon a sudden and unexpected potential failure of the primary tie down device.A variety of devices for tie-down tensioning are known in the art. However, such devices have been subject to one or more disadvantages in use. For example, some of the devices of the prior art have made it difficult to adjust the length of the tie-down to size prior to tensioning. This is especially true for those devices incorporating complex and inconvenient ratcheting or cam mechanisms. Most other devices are complicated and expensive to manufacture. Others incorporate sheaves, pins, springs, ratchets, cams, and other small parts that will wear out, potentially fail suddenly and without warning, and not work properly in harsh, muddy, wet, and extremely cold environments.Furthermore, until now most prior art devices have required the user to engage a special unlocking feature at the device to release the rope tension. Unavoidably, this positions the user in close proximity to the load and provides no easy way to put distance between the user and the potentially harmful affects of releasing the tension.Other more pressing problems with the prior art relate to potential unintended and catastrophic sudden failure due to inherent design flaws. For example, in most prior art devices the hook is connected to the main tensioning device with some form of rope or strapping. In other devices the hook is fastened directly to the housing. In all these examples, should the housing or mechanism in the housing fail, the load tension will release. Furthermore, there is no back up method for maintaining the tension in such an event.Embodiments of the present invention provide a significantly enhanced mechanism for hoisting loads and performing other similar functions. When tension is introduced to the rope, a larger proportion of that tension is applied toward lifting a load, as opposed to being countered by frictional forces between the rope and the device. In preferred embodiments, the rope passes over a means for reducing friction (e.g., a wheel that rotates) as the rope is moved. In many such embodiments, there is substantially no relative movement between the wheel and the rope. In some embodiments, the resulting device combines the functionality of a pulley and a jamming cleat.While multiple embodiments of the instant invention are disclosed, alternate embodiments may become apparent to those skilled in the art. The following detailed description describes only illustrative embodiments of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein like elements are designated by like numerals. It should be clearly understood that there is no intent, implied or otherwise, to limit the invention in any form or manner to that described herein. As such, all alternatives are considered as falling within the spirit, scope and intent of the instant invention., respectively, are perspective views of an assembled and a disassembled prior art tensioning device . Detailed descriptions of the features and methods of using tensioning device  are provided in co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 7,428,769 and co-owned U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008/0307612 and 2010/0212116 all of which, in their entirety, are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, housing  of tensioning device  comprises two opposed walls  and . When assembled, opposed walls  and  together define jamming cleat , locking element  and channel  within housing . Jamming cleat  comprising a plurality of opposing ridges  and  in opposed walls  and , respectively, is configured for imparting a non-slip grip on flexible elongated element  therewithin. Locking element  comprising locking arm  is configured for retaining flexible elongated element  within jamming cleat  upon placement of flexible elongated element  in the space between housing  and locking arm . Housing  further includes at least one aperture  extending therethrough, wherein aperture  is formed by aligned apertures  and  in opposed walls  and , respectively. Alternate embodiments of tensioning device  include additional apertures extending through housing , such as aperture  formed by aligned apertures  and  in opposed walls  and , respectively. In the prior art tensioning device  illustrated in , channel  extends through housing  between openings  and  and around the interior surface of aperture . As shown, channel  functions as a passage for flexible elongated element  within housing , extending from the first opening , through an approximately 180° turn, to the second opening . Securing elements, such as removable securing element  extending through aperture  in housing , are used for attaching tensioning device  to a substantially fixed object for the purpose of tensioning flexible elongated element .In use, channel  guides flexible elongated element  through housing . An end of flexible elongated element  extends away from housing  at opening , another end of flexible elongated element  extends away from housing  at opening , and a portion of flexible elongated element  is movably engaged within housing . The portion of flexible elongated element  extending away from housing  at opening  is herein after referred to as an end section of flexible elongated element . After an object has been secured to the end of flexible elongated element  extending away from housing  at opening  and removable securing element  extending through aperture  (or aperture ) in housing  attaches tensioning device  to a substantially fixed object, the end section of flexible elongated element  is pulled in a general direction away from housing  at opening  until a desired tension is achieved in flexible elongated element . Next, as illustrated in , a portion of the end section proximate opening  is first placed within jamming cleat  and then secured within locking element  by placing flexible elongated element  into the space between housing  and locking arm . Accordingly, both flexible elongated element  and the object secured to the end of flexible elongated element  extending away from housing  at opening  are held under tension. The applied tension is relieved by performing the steps in the reverse order., respectively, are perspective views of an assembled and a disassembled tensioning device  in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Several components and features of tensioning device  are substantially similar to those of tensioning device  described herein above with reference to . As illustrated in , housing  of tensioning device  comprises two opposed walls  and . When assembled, opposed walls  and  together define jamming cleat , locking element  and channel  within housing . Jamming cleat  comprising a plurality of opposing ridges  and  in opposed walls  and , respectively, is configured for imparting a non-slip grip on a flexible elongated element (not shown) that is placed therewithin. Locking element  comprising locking arm  is configured for retaining the flexible elongated element within jamming cleat  upon placement of the flexible elongated element within the space between housing  and locking arm . Housing  further includes at least one aperture  extending therethrough, wherein aperture  is formed by aligned apertures  and  in opposed walls  and , respectively. As illustrated in , the inside surface of wall  includes indentation (or hollow)  around aperture . A complimentary indentation or hollow (not shown) on the inside surface of wall  around aperture  aligns with indentation  to define nest  for housing wheel . In an embodiment of the invention, the diameter of hub  of wheel  is essentially equal to the diameters of apertures  and  such that upon assembly of opposed walls  and , aperture  extending through housing  also extends through hub  of wheel . Alternate embodiments of tensioning device  include additional apertures extending through housing , such as aperture  formed by aligned apertures  and  in opposed walls  and , respectively.As illustrated in , channel  extends through housing  between openings  and  and around the outside circumferential surface of wheel . As such, channel  functions as a passage for the flexible elongated element within housing  from the first opening , through an approximately 180° turn, to the second opening . As described herein below, movement of the flexible elongated element within channel  imparts a rotational movement on wheel .As can be seen from , opposed walls  and  have substantially complementary outer edges and form housing  when these outer edges are positioned against one another and opposed walls  and  are secured in place by fastening elements. As shown, bolts  extending through apertures  and  in opposed walls  and , respectively, are secured by nuts . Alternate fastening elements for forming housing  by securing opposed walls  and  in place are considered as falling within the spirit, scope and intent of the instant invention.Securement elements, such as removable securing element  extending through aperture  in housing , are used for attaching tensioning device  to a substantially fixed object for the purpose of tensioning the flexible elongated element extending through housing . Securing element  includes substantially straight section  extending through both aperture  in housing  and hub  of wheel . As such, substantially straight section  of securing element  is essentially configured to function as an axle for wheel  around which wheel  rotates when the flexible elongated element moves within channel  and through housing . In an embodiment of the invention, tip (or end)  of substantially straight section  includes securement means well known in the art for inhibiting removal or disengagement of securing element  from aperture  of housing . As illustrated in , tip  comprises one or more circumferential ridges or indentations configured for securing clip  such as a spring clip or any other similar element. In an alternate embodiment, tip  is configured for securement with a pin such as a cotter pin, hair pin, clevis pin, and the like. In another embodiment, tip  is threaded for securement with a nut or other similar element. In another embodiment, tip  is configured for securement with a rivet. In some embodiments, the structure of tip  includes a feature (e.g., a crimp, a bend, etc.) that serve to secure the securement element  in place. Other structural features of the securing element can also serve the securement purpose. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, sliding movement of tensioning device  along substantially straight section  is limited (or restricted) by including at least two spaced apart securement means, similar to one or more of those described in the foregoing, on either side of housing . In another embodiments of the invention, the spaced apart securement means on either side of housing  are used for fixedly attaching tensioning device  to securing element  for inhibiting both rotational and translational movement of housing  relative to substantially straight section . In yet another embodiments of the invention, the spaced apart securement means on either side of housing  are used for attaching tensioning device  to securing element  such that rotational movement of housing  about substantially straight section  is permitted, however translational movement of housing  along substantially straight section  is inhibited. To one skilled in the art, additional securement means enabling alternate movements of housing  relative to securing element  will apparent. As shown in , substantially straight section  of securing element  entering aperture  of housing  through aperture  in wall , extending through hub  of wheel , exiting aperture  of housing  through aperture  in wall , and retained in this configuration with the installment of clip  in tip  extending through wall . As it will be clearly apparent to one skilled in the art, the exemplary configuration for attaching housing  to securing element  illustrated in  is reversible in that substantially straight section  of securing element  enters aperture  of housing  through aperture  in wall , extends through hub  of wheel , exits aperture  of housing  through aperture  in wall , and retained in this configuration with the installment of clip  in tip  extending through wall . Alternate securement means for attaching tensioning device  to a substantially fixed object are considered as falling within the spirit, scope and intent of the instant invention.In use, channel  guides the flexible elongated element through housing . An end of the flexible elongated element extends away from housing  at opening , another end of the flexible elongated element extends away from housing  at opening , and a portion of the flexible elongated element is movably engaged within housing . The portion of the flexible elongated element extending away from housing  at opening  is herein after referred to as an end section of the flexible elongated element. After an object has been secured to the end of the flexible elongated element extending away from housing  at opening  and removable securing element  extending through both aperture  in housing  and hub  of wheel  attaches tensioning device  to a substantially fixed object, the end section of the flexible elongated element is pulled in a general direction away from housing  at opening  until a desired tension is achieved in the flexible elongated element. Next, as previously described in reference to , a portion of the end section proximate opening  is first placed within jamming cleat  and then secured within locking element  by placing the flexible elongated element into the space between housing  and locking arm . Accordingly, both the flexible elongated element and the object secured to the end of the flexible elongated element extending away from housing  at opening  are held under tension. The applied tension is relieved by performing the steps in the reverse order.As will be apparent to one skilled in the art, substantially straight section  of securing element , when attached to housing  as described herein above, functions as an axle for wheel . In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, wheel  is dimensioned such that there is minimal contact between wheel  and any internal surface of housing , including any surface of nest , while substantially straight section  of securing element  extends through hub  of wheel . A portion of the flexible elongated element within channel  of housing  will be in contact with a portion of the outer circumferential surface of wheel  such that any movement of the flexible elongated element within channel  will impart a rotational movement on wheel  around substantially straight section  functioning as the axle for wheel . Referring back to the prior art embodiment illustrated in , it is seen that at least a portion of aperture  shares a common surface with at least a portion of channel . As it will be apparent to one skilled in the art, this common surface between aperture  and channel  will impart a frictional resistance to the movement of flexible elongated element  within housing . As it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art, this friction resistance inherent in the prior art embodiment shown in  is essentially eliminated with the incorporation of wheel  in the embodiment of the instant invention as illustrated in . As can be seen, wheel  will rotate in conjunction with the movement of the flexible elongated element around aperture  in housing .While the embodiment of the invention shown in  illustrate a simple wheel  as the means for reducing friction, alternate configurations will be apparent to one skilled in the art. For instance, an alternate embodiment of the invention will incorporate a wheel with a locking mechanism which will permit the wheel to rotate in a first direction but not in a second direction opposite the first direction. One such locking mechanism that can be easily incorporated is a ratcheting mechanism as is well known in the art. As such, the wheel will rotate in conjunction with the movement of the flexible elongated element in the first direction; however, movement of the flexible elongated element in the second direction opposite the first direction will lock the wheel and impart frictional resistance between the circumferential surface of the wheel and the flexible elongated element. In some instances, the friction resistance resulting from the locked wheel and the movement of the flexible elongated element in the second direction can be substantial and, as such, can be advantageous when relieving the tension in the flexible elongated element. All wheel locking mechanisms and/or any combinations thereof are considered as falling within the spirit, scope and intent of the instant invention.In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, wheel  functions as a pulley. In an alternate embodiment, wheel  comprises a groove between a pair of flanges around a circumference of the wheel wherein the flexible elongated element is housed within the groove. In another embodiment of the invention, the outer circumferential surface of wheel  includes a plurality of longitudinally or angularly extending ribs or ridges or grooves for providing the flexible elongated element a “grip” on the wheel. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the outer circumferential surface of wheel  comprises a non-smooth, for example a roughened, texture for enhancing a “grip” between the flexible elongated element and the wheel. Combinations of one or more of such design considerations and/or other means for reducing friction will be apparent to one skilled in the art. All such configurations are considered as falling within the spirit, scope and intent of the instant invention., respectively, are perspective views of an assembled and a disassembled tensioning device  in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. Several components and features of tensioning device  are substantially similar to those of tensioning device  described herein above with reference to . As illustrated in , housing  of tensioning device  comprises two opposed walls  and . When assembled, opposed walls  and  together define jamming cleat , locking element  and channel  within housing . Jamming cleat  comprising a plurality of opposing ridges  and  in opposed walls  and , respectively, is configured for imparting a non-slip grip on a flexible elongated element (not shown) that is placed therewithin. Locking element  comprising locking arm  is configured for retaining the flexible elongated element within jamming cleat  upon placement of the flexible elongated element within the space between housing  and locking arm .As illustrated in , the inside surface of wall  includes cylindrical extension  with clearance  therearound for housing wheel . A complimentary cylindrical extension on the inside surface of wall  aligns with cylindrical extension  to define an axle for hub  of wheel . Additionally, a complementary clearance around the complimentary cylindrical extension on the inside surface of wall  aligns with clearance  to define a housing for wheel . The cylindrical extensions, the clearances around the cylindrical extensions, wheel  and hub  are all dimensioned for ensuring smooth rotation of wheel  around the axle formed by the cylindrical extensions and within the housing formed by the clearances around the cylindrical extensions. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, wheel  is dimensioned such that there is minimal contact between the outer circumferential surface of wheel  and any internal surface of housing , including any surfaces of the wheel housing formed by complimentary clearances such as clearance . Other means for supporting wheel  may involve a separate metal shaft rather than the cylindrical extensions, along with other structures known by those of ordinary skill in the art.Housing  includes one or more apertures  and  for attaching tensioning device  to a removable securing element (not shown) such as securing elements  and  as described in the foregoing with reference to . Aperture  is defined between opposed walls  and  when housing  is formed. As shown, aperture  extending through housing , is formed by aligned apertures  and  in opposed walls  and , respectively.As illustrated in , channel  extends through housing  between openings  and  and around the outside circumferential surface of wheel . As such, channel  functions as a passage for the flexible elongated element within housing  from the first opening , through an approximately ° turn, to the second opening . Movement of the flexible elongated element within channel  imparts a rotational movement on wheel . As can be seen, a portion of the flexible elongated element within channel  of housing  will be in contact with a portion of the outer circumferential surface of wheel  such that any movement of the flexible elongated element within channel  will impart a rotational movement on wheel  around the complimentary cylindrical extensions. As previously described, the complimentary cylindrical extensions, such as cylindrical extension  on the inside surface of wall , form an axle for wheel . Referring back to the prior art embodiment illustrated in , it is seen that at least a portion of aperture  shares a common surface with at least a portion of channel . As it will be apparent to one skilled in the art, this common surface between aperture  and channel  will impart a frictional resistance to the movement of flexible elongated element  within housing . As it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art, this friction resistance inherent in the prior art embodiment shown in  is essentially eliminated with the incorporation of wheel  in the embodiment of the instant invention as illustrated in . As can be seen, wheel  will rotate in conjunction with the movement of the flexible elongated element around the complimentary cylindrical extensions on the inside surfaces of opposed walls  and  of housing .As can be seen from , opposed walls  and  have substantially complementary outer edges and form housing  when these outer edges are positioned against one another and opposed walls  and  are secured in place by fastening elements. As shown, bolts  extending through apertures  and  in opposed walls  and , respectively, are secured by nuts . Alternate fastening elements for forming housing  by securing opposed walls  and  in place are considered as falling within the spirit, scope and intent of the instant invention.Securement elements, such as removable securing elements  and  described in the foregoing with reference to , extending through one or more apertures, such as apertures  and  in housing , are used for attaching tensioning device  to a substantially fixed object for the purpose of tensioning the flexible elongated element extending through housing . In some preferred embodiments, a carabineer can be extended through aperture  to serve as the securing element. As previously stated, alternate securement means for attaching tensioning device  to a substantially fixed object are considered as falling within the spirit, scope and intent of the instant invention. Embodiments like those shown in   can be advantageous in that the securing element does not affect the movement of the flexible elongated element relative to the wheel .In use, channel  guides the flexible elongated element through housing . An end of the flexible elongated element extends away from housing  at opening , another end of the flexible elongated element extends away from housing  at opening , and a portion of the flexible elongated element is movably engaged within housing . The portion of the flexible elongated element extending away from housing  at opening  is herein after referred to as an end section of the flexible elongated element. After a securement element attaches tensioning device  to a substantially fixed object and an object has been secured to the end of the flexible elongated element extending away from housing  at opening , the end section of the flexible elongated element is pulled in a general direction away from housing  at opening  until a desired tension is achieved in the flexible elongated element. Next, as previously described in reference to , a portion of the end section proximate opening  is first placed within jamming cleat  and then secured within locking element  by placing the flexible elongated element into the space between housing  and locking arm . Accordingly, both the flexible elongated element and the object secured to the end of the flexible elongated element extending away from housing  at opening  are held under tension. The applied tension is relieved by performing the steps in the reverse order.While the embodiment of the invention shown in  illustrate a simple wheel , alternate wheel configurations will be apparent to one skilled in the art. For instance, and as previously described in the foregoing with reference to wheel  in the embodiment illustrated in , an alternate embodiment of the invention will incorporate a wheel with a locking mechanism which will permit the wheel to rotate in a first direction but not in a second direction opposite the first direction. All alternate wheel locking mechanisms and/or any combinations thereof are considered as falling within the spirit, scope and intent of the instant invention.In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, wheel  functions as a pulley similar to wheel . Alternate embodiments of the means for reducing friction, such as those previously described as alternate embodiments for wheel , are considered as falling within the spirit, scope and intent of the instant invention. Exemplary embodiments for wheel  comprise a groove between a pair of flanges around a circumference of the wheel, a plurality of longitudinally or angularly extending ribs or ridges or grooves on the outer circumferential surface of the wheel, non-smooth or roughened outer circumferential surface, etc. All such variations are considered as falling within the spirit, scope and intent of the instant invention.Various modifications and additions may be made to the exemplary embodiments described hereinabove without departing from the scope, intent and spirit of the instant invention. For example, while the disclosed embodiments refer to particular features, the scope of the instant invention is considered to also include embodiments having various combinations of features different from and/or in addition to those described hereinabove. Accordingly, the present invention embraces all such alternatives, modifications, and variations as within the scope, intent and spirit of the appended claims, including all equivalents thereof."

                "Continuation in Part of 12/587,550 Edged Non-Horizontal Burial Containers.Not applicableNot applicableThis invention relates to conserving cemetery space by using easy to install burial containers which can be self bored into earth or other receiving materials and do not require a large amount of land area or a large pre-dug rectangular hole.A common current interment practice is to first move a body to a mortuary where it is prepared for funeral services. In cases where a body is unclaimed, it is usually provided with minimum preparation and burial, paid for by public funds. A claimed body, after mortuary preparation, is usually placed in an aescetically pleasing casket and either displayed in an open casket funeral service or the casket alone is visible in a closed casket service. Often, after an indoor service the body and casket are moved to a prepared grave site in a cemetery, where a final service is performed.At the prepared grave site the casket containing the body is set either on or in a box like crypt during a grave side funeral service, if one is conducted. None of these burial services need be changed for the use of a Self Boring Vertical Burial Container. Several types of these burial containers are designed to be set on floral or otherwise decorated boxes for open or closed casket funeral services in an in door or out door environment.Currently the prepared grave is often a rectangular excavation approximately four feet wide by seven and a half feet long by six and a half feet deep. Walkways are left on all sides of the grave for later visitors, making about 50 square feet of ground area to be set aside for each grave. A Self Boring Vertical Burial Container requires only about one third of the space used for a current horizontal burial.The removed receiving material from the current type grave excavation is usually piled next to the grave site and covered during a grave side funeral service, if one is conducted. After funeral services, the casket and or box like crypt is lowered to the bottom of the prepared grave excavation and the removed receiving material is shoveled back into the excavation. Ground cover, such as grass, is then restored over the site. In a Self Boring Vertical Burial Container burial only a very small amount of ground cover needs to be replaced.In current type burials, additional digging and preparation is often undertaken to provide for the installation of a headstone, plaque marker or monument and the installation of flower and flag receptacles for persons to later pay respects and honor the deceased. Flower and flag receptacles and provisions for plaques, markers and monuments, are regularly built into the tops or head pieces of Self Boring Vertical Burial Containers.Cemetery properties are usually selected and developed in costly, but pleasant areas with level and softer earth or other receiving materials. Roads, landscaping, fences, monuments, statues, trees, ponds and other items are added for utility and aesthetics. The cost of each grave site, and thus each burial, is relative to the number of grave sites on the developed cemetery property. The business of a cemetery is based on the number of grave sites available in the cemetery. With the Self Boring Vertical Burial Container method a cemetery has about three times the potential grave sites as in current horizontal burial practice. In addition, the invented containers can be readily installed in ponds, corners and steeply sloped land adding greatly to the available grave site total in a cemetery.All in all, the Self Boring Vertical Burial Container method significantly reduces the cost of each grave site and each burial and provides for a tripling of the business potential for each existing old and new cemetery.It is a main object of this invention to greatly reduce the cost of each grave site by significantly reducing the land area required for each burial.It is another object of this invention to reduce the cost of a burial by significantly reducing the amount of excavation and replacement of receiving material.It is an object of this invention to greatly reduce the secondary labor currently required to finish a grave site after interment by providing for plaque, monument, flag and flower placement as an integral part of the burial container.The preferred embodiment of this invention is a Self Boring Vertical Burial Container with a strong hull, tapered from an upper head end toward a lower foot end and having cutting edges extending outward from the foot end perpendicular or at a lesser angle to a diameter larger than that of the upper head end of the container and having receiving material guides starting along the upper edges of the cutting edges and extending upward along the length of the hull to just below the wrenchable portion of the upper part of the container and to a diameter larger than that of the hull. When such a burial container is rotated in the correct direction the cutting edges at the lower foot end of the hull remove about the same volume of receiving material as can be guided up and out by the guides extending outward farther than the hull wall surface and creating space between the hull and the hole being bored by the container. Power equipment on a vehicle grips the burial container and attaches a wrench to the drivable upper head end of the burial container and holds the container in place while it rotates the container to make the interment. The body to be interred is not affected by the motion as it is securely encapsulated within the container to stand proudly tall for all time.is a side view of an open Self Boring Vertical Burial Container with self digging cutting edges, , and guides, , and a hull split lengthwise into an upper lid segment, , and a lower main section, , as is common practice in current coffins and caskets, with a body, , inside, and being stabilized and held level by blocks, , for funeral display.is an end view of a Self Boring Vertical Burial Container illustrating the positions of a raised lid segment, , a body , a lower main section, , and support blocks, .is a side view of a Self Boring Vertical Burial Container in a closed position showing guides, , which guide the cut away receiving material to the surface, and added on cutting edges, .is a side view of the foot end only of a Self Boring Vertical Burial Container with cutting edges, , set at and angle other than perpendicular to the main axis of the burial container.is an end view of a Self Boring Vertical Burial Container showing cutting edges and receiving material guides, .is an end view of a screw in top showing driven flats, , rectangular plaque or monument area, , flower receptacle,  and flag holder, .is a side view of the screw in top shown in , which fits the hull depicted in , pointing out its driven flats, , and threads, , to match those inside a hull.is a side view of a single piece, non-split hull with receiving material guides, , and a body, .is a side view of a Self Boring Vertical Burial Container being held by a device, , on the end of a vehicle arm, , and being revolved by a socket wrench, , driven in the correct direction by a drive motor, , with dug out receiving material, , around the hole.is a cut away side view of a Self Boring Vertical Burial Container having been dug into a receiving material with some dug out receiving material, , around the hole and some dug away receiving material, , being guided upward and out through the space between the hole and the hull by guides extending out from the hull.is a cut away side view of a Self Boring Vertical Burial Container, now fully installed, showing its top, , in its final position after the receiving material around the hull has been tamped, the surplus removed and the ground cover restored."

This is in spite of the fact that the G master electrode is a single conductive structure wherein location of connection would not be relevant in a lumped circuit representation. Circuit diagrams rely upon a lumped circuit model for accuracy of representation. In order to represent this geometric requirement relating to distributed circuit design in lumped circuit figures, the inventors schematically represent the energy conditioners as devices having at least  terminal device, with A, B, G terminals.

The same solder contacts may also contact corresponding conductive regions of the mounting structures shown in .Meaning of “Plate”, and Interconnector and IC Alternative EmbodimentsThe term “plate” herein generally is used to simplify explanation by defining a combination of a dielectric under layer with none, one, or more than one distinct conductive over layers. However, the relevant structure is the sequence of conductive layers separated by dielectric material. The hidden surface of the structures referred as plates in the following figures represents a dielectric surface; that is, dielectric material vertically separating the defined conductive layers from one another. In discrete energy conditioner component embodiments, the structure are often formed by layering dielectric precursor material (green material) with conductive layer precursor material (conductive paste or the like), firing that layered structure at temperatures sufficient to convert the dielectric precursor to a desired structurally rigid dielectric material and to convert the conductive precursor layer to a high relatively conductivity (low resistivity) conductive layer. However, embodiments formed in interconnects and semiconductor structures would use different techniques, including conventional lithographic techniques, to fabricate equivalent or corresponding structures to those shown in , , , , and . Importantly, the conductive bands and solder connections for stacked layers discussed herein below would in many cases be replaced by an array of conductively filled or lined vias selectively connecting conductive layers of the same master electrode to one another. Preferably, those vias would be spaced to selectively contact the tab regions of the A, B, and G layers discussed herein.Regardless of the mechanism of formation, it is the existence of the master electrodes' morphologies, assembly with external conductive structure, assembly with mounting structure, and integration into circuits - that are functionally important for decoupling.Common Features of Internal Structure of Energy ConditionersA master electrode refers to the conductive layers or regions internal to an energy conditioner and the structure internal to the energy conditioner physically contacting those conductive layers or regions so that they form one integral conductive structure.Internal structure of energy conditioners includes conductive layers or regions spaces by dielectric material from other conductive layers or regions. The conductive layers or regions each have tab regions that extend to an edge or periphery of the dielectric material. An edge of each tab region of each conductive layer is contacted to external surface conductive structure. The external surface conductive structure may be either conductive bands integral to the discrete energy conditioner or by solder employed also to mount the energy conditioner internal structure to mounting structure. In energy conditioner internal structures having a plurality of conductive layers or regions designed to form a single master electrode, tabs of those conductive layers or regions are vertically aligned in the stack of layers so that a single conductive tab may conductively connect those conductive layers or regions to thereby form a master electrode.Alternatively, or in addition to conductive bands or solder connecting to externally exposed edges of conductive layers or regions of a master electrode, conductively filled or lined vias may selectively connect to the same conductive layers or regions.Relationship Between Internal Structures of Energy Conditioners and External Structure of Energy ConditionersEach one of the internal structures of energy conditioners shown in , , , , and  may reside in each one of external surface A to K of  in two distinct configurations.

In this alternative, conductive tabs AT and AT, for example, are still vertically aligned and conductively connected by contacts to the inner surface of conductive band C. As with other embodiments, additional alternatives stacks include a repeating sequences of the three plates of layers of stack A, and irregular sequences of A, B, and C, and the alternative to C noted above.shows stack A including a sequence of plates A, B, C, B, A, B, C.Plates A each have an upper surface that consists of a surface of conductive layer A and exposed dielectric surface D. Conductive layer A consists of tabs AT, AT, and main body portion AMB. Conductive layer A is part of an A master electrode. Tab AT extends to the US near the LS. Tab AT extends to the LLS near the LS. AMB extends from tabs AT and AT towards the LS.

                "1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a device that assembles syringes for use in medical practice.2. Description of Related ArtIn recent years, syringes for injecting drug solutions have often been provided as prefilled syringes that are previously filled with drug solutions. An example of the configuration of a syringe formed with a barrel and a plunger is shown in , B, A, B and .The barrel  is a cylindrical component formed of synthetic resin; at one end thereof, a luer taper portion for the attachment of an injection needle is formed. The luer taper portion is covered with a sealing member  that is formed of rubber or soft synthetic resin. A shoulder portion that is formed in the process of narrowing the barrel to the thickness of the luer taper portion in a downward direction is a taper portion . A flange  is formed at the other end of the barrel . The flange  is designed for the attachment of a grip member (not shown) underneath which first and second fingers are put; the flange  is not circular and is shaped to have a major axis and a minor axis. In , an example of the flange  that is rectangular with rounded corners is shown; however, the flange  may have another shape such as an oval shape.A gasket  formed of rubber or soft synthetic resin is inserted into the barrel . In the end face of the gasket  opposite the end face pointing to the luer taper portion, a screw portion  is formed in a position that coincides with the central axis of the barrel . The screw portion  is a right-hand female screw.A plunger rod  is combined with the gasket . The plunger rod  is a component that is cross-shaped in cross section and is formed of synthetic resin; at one end thereof, a knob  for putting thereon the thick of a thumb is formed. On the other end of the plunger rod , a screw portion  that is screwed into the screw portion  of the gasket  is formed in a position of the central axis. The screw portion  is a right-hand male screw. By tightly screwing the screw portion  into the screw portion  of the gasket  within the barrel , the gasket  and the plunger rod  are integrally coupled to constitute the plunger  (see ), and the barrel  and the plunger  constitute a syringe .An automated line is used to manufacture the syringes . In the automated line, an assembly device is included that performs an operation of screwing the plunger rod into the gasket within the barrel. Examples of this type of assembly device are disclosed in patent documents 1 and 2.In the syringe assembly device disclosed in patent document 1, while a plunger rod is so supported at a given height that it cannot be rotated, a barrel is rotated, and thus the plunger rod is screwed. The barrel is rotated by a belt mechanism that is obliquely provided with respect to its cylindrical surface. While the barrels are transported by an arrangement disc (wheel), labels are attached on them.In the syringe assembly device disclosed in patent document 2, while a plunger rod is supported with a slider moving up and down due to the shape of a three-dimensional cam such that the plunger rod cannot be rotated, a barrel is rotated to perform screwing of the plunger rod. The barrel is rotated by a belt.A belt that makes a friction contact with a barrel to transmit rotation also prevents the barrel from moving up and down freely. In the device disclosed in patent document 1, an angle at which the belt is obliquely arranged is needed to be precisely equal to the lead angle of the screw. Otherwise, since the belt does not follow the barrel raised by the screwing, it is likely that a screwing station is disadvantageously passed while the screwing rotation angle is insufficient. In other words, each time the lead angle of the screw is varied according to the type of syringe, it is necessary to adjust the angle at which the belt is obliquely arranged.In the device disclosed in patent document 2, it is necessary to lower the plunger rod as the barrel is rotated. However, if the gasket is improperly positioned, the movement of the plunger rod that is lowered by the lead angle of the screw portion of the gasket differs from the movement of the slider that is lowered by the three-dimensional cam, and thus it is also likely that a screwing station is disadvantageously passed while the screwing rotation angle is insufficient.In view of the forgoing, the present invention is designed, and has an object to provide a syringe assembly device that can completely and accurately screw a plunger rod into a gasket within a barrel.According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a syringe assembly device for screwing a plunger rod into a gasket within a barrel, the syringe assembly device including: a barrel support device that supports a barrel rotationally about an axis of the barrel at a predetermined height with the axis being arranged vertically and an opening of the barrel through which the plunger rod is inserted being directed upward; a plunger rod support device that includes: a chuck which pinches the plunger rod and holds the plunger rod above the opening of the barrel with an axis of the plunger rod being arranged vertically; and a load application device which places a load on the plunger rod held by the chuck; and a rotation application device that rotates the barrel about the axis of the barrel. In the syringe assembly device, the rotation application device places the load acting in a downward direction of the axis on the plunger rod which is held by the chuck and whose end is inserted into the barrel, and, in this state, the load application device rotates the barrel in a direction in which the plunger rod is screwed into the gasket.In this configuration, the load application device is used to place the load acting axially and downwardly on the plunger rod, and simultaneously the rotation application device is used to rotate the barrel and thereby screw the plunger rod into the gasket. Thus, as the screwing is being performed, the plunger rod is naturally lowered, and the movement of a screw portion of the gasket that lowers the plunger rod by a lead angle thereof does not differ from the actual movement of the plunger rod, resulting in complete and accurate screwing.In the syringe assembly device configured as described above according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the chuck can enter a first holding state in which the plunger rod is prevented from rotating about and sliding along the axis of the plunger rod or a second holding state in which the plunger rod is prevented from rotating about the axis of the plunger rod but is not prevented from sliding along the axis, the plunger rod support device performs a first operation of lowering the chuck pinching the plunger rod in the first holding state to insert the end of the plunger rod into the barrel and a second operation of making the chuck enter the second holding state and making the load application device place the load acting axially and downwardly on the plunger rod, and the rotation application device rotates the barrel when the plunger rod support device performs the second operation.In this configuration, when the chuck is in the second holding state in which the plunger rod is prevented from rotating about the axis of the plunger rod but is not prevented from sliding along the axis, the load application device is used to place the load acting axially and downwardly on the plunger rod, and simultaneously the rotation application device is used to rotate the barrel and thereby screw the plunger rod into the gasket. Thus, the screwing is performed without the plunger rod being hindered from lowered.In the syringe assembly device configured as described above according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the barrel support device and the plunger rod support device are each provided in a plurality, and the barrel support devices and the plunger rod support devices are both spaced at equal angles on a circumference of a turret that rotates about a vertical axis, a chuck lifting device provided for the chuck includes: a three-dimensional cam arranged along a circling track of the plunger rod support device; and a chuck support stem being held by the turret such that the chuck support stem moves vertically along an undulation of the three-dimensional cam, the rotation application device may be supported by a rotary shuttle that moves back and forth on an arc track having the same center as the turret; and each of the turret, the rotary shuttle and the rotation application device is driven by an individual motor.In this configuration, when parameters necessary to completely perform the screwing, such as the rotation angle of the barrel and the outer diameter of the barrel, are changed, the change can be easily and conveniently dealt with by changing the motor control program of the rotation application device.According to the present invention, even if an error occurs in the position of the gasket within the barrel, it is possible to successfully screw the plunger rod into the gasket as desired.The configuration of a syringe assembly device according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. The syringe assembly device  schematically shown in  has three turrets that are generally referred to star wheels. The three turrets are each configured as a rotary member that rotates about vertical shafts, and their circumferential speeds are set equal to each other. Among the three turrets, the first one is a component-receiving turret , the second one is a syringe assembly turret  and the third one is a relay turret . A rotary shuttle  that moves back and forth on an arc track having the same center as the syringe assembly turret  is combined with the syringe assembly turret .The component-receiving turret  receives plunger rods  shown in  from a linear feeder , receives barrels  shown in  from a linear feeder  and aligns them along a vertical axis to feed them to the syringe assembly turret . During a time the syringe assembly turret  transports the barrels  and the plunger rods  to the relay turret , a rotation application device  mounted on the rotary shuttle  moving along with the syringe assembly turret  rotates the barrels , and thus the plunger rods  are screwed into gaskets , with the result that syringes  are assembled. This mechanism will be described in detail later. The assembled syringes  are transferred from the syringe assembly turret  to the relay turret , and are then transferred from the relay turret  to a conveyer (not shown) in a label attachment line.The component-receiving turret  is driven by a motor ; the syringe assembly turret  is driven by a motor ; the rotary shuttle  is driven by a motor ; the rotation application devices  is driven by a motor ; and the relay turret  is driven by a motor . The motors  and  are servomotors. The motors ,  and  can be normal induction motors. A combination of all or some of the motors ,  and  may be replaced by a single motor, and the rotation of the single motor may be distributed to the turrets and conveyer with power transmission means such as a gear train and a timing belt.The motor , the motor  and the motor  continuously rotate the component-receiving turret , the syringe assembly turret  and the relay turret , respectively. The motor  moves the rotary shuttle  back and forth along the arc track. A mechanism that transmits power of the motor  to the rotary shuttle  for shuttle movement of the rotary shuttle  can be, for example, combination of an arc-shaped rack fixed to the rotary shuttle  and a pinion that engages the rack and is driven by the motor ; however, the present invention is not limited to this mechanism.On the circumference of the syringe assembly turret , a total of eighteen barrel support devices  shown in  are spaced at equal angles. The barrel support device  supports a barrel  rotationally about an axis of the barrel  at a predetermined height with the axis of the barrel  being arranged vertically and an opening of the barrel  through which the plunger rod  is inserted being directed upward.The barrel support device  includes backup rollers  that support a cylindrical surface of the barrel . The backup rollers  are supported rotationally about a vertical axis, and neighboring two are paired, as shown in . A flange  formed on the lower end of the backup roller  receives the taper portion of the barrel , and thus the barrel  is held at the height.If in the barrel , the shoulder portion, formed to narrow the barrel to the thickness of the luer taper portion, has a surface perpendicular to the barrel axis, the height of the barrel  is constant when the shoulder portion is received by the flange. However, since, in this embodiment, the shoulder portion is the taper portion , it is not certain as to what part of the tapered surface the flange  comes in contact with. Thus, variation in the height of the barrel  is a given. Hence, if labels are attached to the barrels  while the syringe assembly turret  transports the barrels , as in the case of patent document 1, it is impossible to prevent variations in the location where the label is attached. To overcome this problem, label attachment means is not provided in the syringe assembly turret , but provided in another location.An arc-shaped fixed guide  is provided outside the syringe assembly turret ; this fixed guide  prevents the barrel  from coming off the backup roller . A clearance of about 0.5 mm is provided between the fixed guide  and the barrel .In the syringe assembly turret , plunger rod support devices  are arranged to form pairs with the barrel support devices . The plunger rod support device  is provided with: two chuck support stems and that penetrate the syringe assembly turret  vertically and that can slide vertically; a deck  that is supported on the upper ends of the chuck support stems and ; and a chuck  that is supported by the deck . The chuck  holds the plunger rod  in a vertical state, and arranges it above the opening of the barrel  held by the barrel support device .As shown in , the chuck  has a pair of fingers and , and the fingers and are closed to pinch the plunger rod  between both sides. In the opposite surfaces of the fingers and , recesses corresponding to the cross-shaped cross section of the plunger rod  are formed; as shown in , the fitting of the cross-shaped cross section into the recesses prevents the plunger rod  from rotating about its axis.With an unillustrated power source, the chuck  can be opened at three angles. First, as shown in , in a full-open state where the fingers are fully open, the fingers and are far away from the plunger rod , and the plunger rod  can freely rotate about the axis and move along its axis with respect to the chuck . Second, as shown in , in a first holding state where the fingers and pinch the plunger rod  from both sides, the plunger rod  is prevented from rotating about its axis and is also prevented from sliding along its axis with respect to the chuck . Third, as shown in , in a second holding state where the fingers and are slightly opened as compared with the first holding state, the plunger rod  is also prevented from rotating about its axis but can slide along the axis with respect to the chuck .The plunger rod support device  is moved vertically by a three-dimensional cam  arranged along its circling track. The three-dimensional cam  is a ring-shaped member that is arranged coaxially with an unillustrated rotary shaft of the syringe assembly turret , and is attached to an unillustrated table supporting the syringe assembly turret . A cam groove  is formed in the outer circumferential surface of the three-dimensional cam , and a cam follower roller  attached to the lower end of the chuck support stem engages with the cam groove . The chuck support stem is moved vertically according to the shape of the cam groove . The three-dimensional cam  and the chuck support stem constitute a chuck lifting device .The plunger rod support device  includes a load application device . The load application device  is provided with: a pressure stem  that vertically penetrates the deck  of the plunger rod support device  and being capable of sliding vertically; a disc-shaped pressure head  fixed to the lower end of the pressure stem ; and a cam follower  attached to the upper end of the pressure stem . In part of the circling track of the load application device , a three-dimensional cam  (see ) on which the cam follower  rides is provided; the pressure stem  is moved vertically along undulations of the cam surface of the three-dimensional cam  (the upper surface of the three-dimensional cam ).The rotation application device  mounted on the rotary shuttle  has three combinations of the motor  and a roller  rotated by the motor . The rollers  are spaced at angles equal to the angles at which the barrel support devices  are spaced. The roller  makes contact with the outer circumferential surface of the barrel  supported by the barrel support device  to rotate the barrel .An operation of assembling the syringes is performed as follows. A combination of the barrel support device  and the plunger rod support device , which is arranged on the circumference of the syringe assembly turret , sequentially passes through the total of eighteen angular positions (A to A) set spaced at equal angles. At the angular position A, the syringe assembly turret  and the component-receiving turret  intersect; the syringe assembly turret  and the relay turret  intersect between the angular position A and the angular position A. The fixed guide  is arranged to cover the section from the angular position A to the angular position A.As shown in , at the angular position A, the chuck  of the plunger rod support device  is raised high by the cam groove . The load application device , in which the cam follower  rides on the three-dimensional cam  before the angular position A, is raised high by the three-dimensional cam  at the angular position A. Here, the barrel support device  receives the barrel  from the component-receiving turret , and the plunger rod support device  receives the plunger rod  from the component-receiving turret . At first, the chuck  is in the full-open state shown in  and then, as soon as the plunger rod  is inserted, the chuck  is brought to the first holding state shown in , with the result that the chuck  firmly holds the plunger rod .As the angular position transfers from A to A to A and to A, the chuck  that pinches the plunger rod  in the first holding state is lowered. In the meantime, the end (lower end) of the plunger rod  is inserted into the barrel . This is the first operation of the plunger rod support device . At the angular position A, the chuck  changes its state from the first holding state to the second holding state. Consequently, the plunger rod  cannot rotate about the axis but can slide down from the chuck . Even if the plunger rod  can slide down from the chuck , the plunger rod  is unlikely to drop down in a stroke to the place where the screw portion  makes contact with the screw portion  of the gasket , and the plunger rod  stays part way toward the place.Here, the load application device , which has been lowered together with the chuck , leaves the three-dimensional cam  at a position between the angular positions A and A, and places, on the plunger rod , a load exerted by a mass of the load application device  and acting in the downward direction along the axis of the plunger rod . Consequently, the plunger rod  is forcibly lowered until the screw portion  makes contact with the screw portion . This is the second operation of the plunger rod support device . After the second operation, a space h is left between the lower surface of the knob  of the plunger rod  and the upper surface of the chuck . In the load application device , a spring can be used as load application means instead of or in addition to its mass.While the barrel support device  maintains the original height, and the chuck  maintains the height given by the chuck lifting device  at the angular position A, they move to the angular position A. The rotation application device  advances the rollers  toward three barrels  present at the angular positions A, A and A, respectively, and flexibly presses the rollers  onto the barrels  with an unillustrated spring. In this state, the rotation application device  moves along with the syringe assembly turret , and uses the motor  to drive the rollers , and thereby rotates the barrels . The direction of the rotation is the direction in which the screw portion  of the gasket  is screwed into the screw portion  of the plunger rod .As the screwing is being performed, the plunger rod  that is prevented from rotating about its axis by the chuck  is lowered. How the plunger rod  is lowered is shown in . When, in each of the three barrels , the screw portion  is completely screwed into the screw portion , a torque for the screwing reaches a set torque value. The motors  that reach the set torque value individually stop the rotation. The torque at which the motor  stops the rotation, that is, the set torque value is set to the highest of the values at which relative rotation does not occur between the barrel  and the gasket . Thus, it is possible to prevent the case where the gasket  is forcibly rotated and thus the outer circumferential surface thereof is worn by friction with the inner surface of the barrel .As described above, the load application device  is used to place the load acting axially and downwardly on the plunger rod , and simultaneously the rotation application device  is used to rotate the barrel  and thereby screw the plunger rod  into the gasket . Thus, as the screwing is being performed, the plunger rod  is naturally lowered, and the movement of the screw portion  of the gasket  that lowers the plunger rod  by a lead angle thereof does not differ from the actual movement of the plunger rod , resulting in complete and accurate screwing.Moreover, when the chuck  is in the second holding state where the plunger rod  is prevented from rotating about the axis but is not prevented from sliding along its axis, the load application device  is used to place the load acting axially and downwardly on the plunger rod , and simultaneously the rotation application device  is used to rotate the barrel  and thereby screw the plunger rod  into the gasket , with the result that the screwing is performed without the plunger rod  being hindered from loweringWhen the screw portion  is completely screwed into the screw portion , the barrel , the gasket  and the plunger rod  are assembled into the syringe . Although the space between the lower surface of the knob  and the upper surface of the chuck  is reduced to a space h (see ), the knob  still does not make contact with the chuck . Since this space h makes allowance, it is possible to accommodate variations in the depth by which the gasket  is inserted into the barrel .Before the three barrels , which are originally placed in the angular positions A, A and A, reach the angular positions A, A and A, respectively, by advancing three angular positions, the rotary shuttle  reverses the direction of the movement, and then the rotary shuttle  returns to the positions where it receives barrels  that are newly supplied to the angular positions A, A and A. Here, the rollers  are pulled back against the force of the spring, and thus the rotary shuttle  does not make contact with the barrels  to rotate them while it is returning.Even when parameters necessary to completely perform the screwing, such as the rotation angle of the barrel  and the outer diameter of the barrel , are changed, the change can be easily and conveniently dealt with by changing the control program of the motors  of the rotation application device .As shown in , when the chuck  reaches the angular position A, it enters the full-open state. As the chuck  advances angular position positions, from A to A to A and to A, the chuck  is raised to leave the syringe . The chuck  in the full-open state allows the knob  of the plunger rod  to pass therethrough but does not allow the pressure head  to pass therethrough, with the result that the load application device  is raised by the chuck . The chuck  reaches the highest height at the angular position A, and moves from the angular position A to the angular position A without changing the height, and then makes the cam follower  ride on the three-dimensional cam  at the angular position A.When the syringe  passes through the angular position A, the syringe  switches from the syringe assembly turret  to the relay turret . A fixed guide similar to the fixed guide  prevents the syringe  from coming off the relay turret . The relay turret  transfers the syringe  to the unillustrated label attachment line at a point where the relay turret  rotates about one half turn from the syringe receiving point.The embodiment of the present invention is described above, and the scope of the invention is not limited to this embodiment, and many modifications are possible without departing from the scope of the invention. The numbers and values mentioned in this specification are simply examples, and the present invention is not limited to them."

                "This non-provisional application claims priority to the pending provisional application 61/360,628 filed on Jul. 1, 2010 which is owned by the same inventor.The propellant actuated hinge remover generally relates to vehicle and strong door hinges and more specifically to a hinge plate, or yoke, having a specialized form and components that release the yoke following ignition of a propellant. The present invention remains inert until a command ignites the propellant which then releases the mechanical hold of the yoke to a vehicle or a door frame. The present invention allows for rapid egress from a vehicle or room, typically in an emergency.Vehicles and rooms with heavy doors, such as coolers, freezers, and light vaults, have doors mounted upon hinges attached to a frame or as an integral part of a frame. The following description refers to vehicles though application to heavy doors not on vehicles is included. A vehicle generally has doors for ingress and egress of passengers and for loading and unloading cargo into the interior of the vehicle. Vehicle doors generally pivot on an exterior edge upon hinges inside of the exterior surface of a vehicle. This location prevents the hinges from disrupting the appearance of the vehicle and from reducing the airflow along the vehicle. In military vehicles, locating hinges within the body of the vehicle also lessens the radar profile of the vehicle.A vehicle door hinge generally has two components connected by a pin or other rotatable means, such as a pawl and wheel. One component secures to an edge of the door and the other component secures to the vehicle body. A pin, or other rotatable means, then allows the component on the door to pivot relative to the component upon the vehicle body. Upon select vehicles, the component upon the body remains an integral part of the body. The body itself has various pins formed therein that cooperate with the component upon the door during opening and closing.Vehicles in general include armored military land vehicles, bomb disposal vehicles, and select naval equipment. These vehicles generally have heavy doors because of their armor yet the doors serve the same passenger and cargo purposes as other vehicle doors. These doors protect the people and cargo inside an armored vehicle from weapons fire, concussion, explosion, nuclear, biological, chemical agents, and the weather. To fulfill this protective purpose, the doors have armor much like the remainder of the vehicle and various seals to close the perimeter of the door to infiltration by a host of hazards in a combat, bomb disposal, or other serious situation. From time to time though, such a door on an armored vehicle requires quick opening, typically for emergency egress of the vehicle passengers and crew. A quick door opening may take place following a round entering the compartment of the vehicle occupied by people or the armored vehicle losing the ability to move.Over the years, armored vehicles and select ships have had various doors and related hinges. The door assembly initially followed that of residential construction, passenger vehicles, and later commercial vehicles. Early armored vehicles had hinges with two leaves joined by a pin through the common edges of the leaves. The leaves then joined the door and the vehicle frame leaving the pin within the rings outwardly from the vehicle. In an emergency, a crewmember pulled the pins and released the door for a quick exit of the crew from the vehicle.Then the pins evolved to have rounded ends that prevented their inadvertent removal from a host of hazards in a combat, bomb disposal, or other serious situation. Rounded end pins though presented a limited edge for extracting them from a hinge. Select hinges had a rounded end pin incorporated into a leaf so that lifting a door upwardly lifted the pin from the other leaf, usually attached to the vehicle, thus removing the door from the vehicle. Lifting an armored door off its hinges has proven a challenge to a crew seeking an emergency exit.As armor increased in weight and thickness upon vehicles, hinges with leaves of a narrow width lacked the capacity to support heavier doors. The door hinges became wider and extended farther out from the vehicle opening. The door hinges took on the appearance of straps. The strap like door hinges often attached to the exterior of a vehicle with both leaves and the pin exposed to a host of hazards. Armor then increased its weight further and also acquired reactive capability, that is, self detonating, to repel warheads or other hazards touching a vehicle. The weight and reactive capability of armor and radar avoidance limited further usage of strap like hinges exposed upon the surface of an armored vehicle. Door hinges then incorporated the pin and one leaf into the frame of the armored vehicle and the other leaf of the hinge into the perimeter of the door. The door hinges then occupied a recessed position within the armor of the armored vehicle which presented a smooth surface in the vicinity of the door. The door and its hinges blend into the armor and overall profile of the vehicle lessening its radar profile. The recessed hinges though prevent ready access to removing pins or hinges for a quick opening of the door.Exploding pins in a hinge provide another means to separate the leaves of a hinge for ready removal of a door. The pins, generally hollow, have an explosive charge placed through their length and a detonation means. In an emergency, detonation of the explosive shatters the pin so that the hinge leaf upon the door separates from the leaf upon the vehicle frame. However, usage of the door, opening and closing, wears on the pin and causes premature detonation from time to time. Shattering the pin also prevents reuse of the pin and may damage one or both hinge leaves which leads to scrapping of an entire door. Further, explosives utilized in a hinge remain similar to a bomb ready for detonation thus, requiring some shielding for vehicle occupants. Explosive bolts in fracturing may also swell and stick in place preventing the emergency egress sought. The high impulse shock, with its short duration of 30-50 nanoseconds, succumbs to the inertia of door holding fixtures.Though the description has involved a door on an armored vehicle, this description and the remainder of the specification also apply to doors upon ships, freezers, coolers, strong rooms, bunkers, garages, hangars, and other locations where people, cargo, or equipment, inside an enclosed space require a ready, rapid, exit through a closed door.The present invention overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art and provides a propellant actuated hinge remover that keeps a leaf of a hinge secured to a frame during most situations, releases the leaf upon ignition of a propellant such as during an emergency, and allows for reuse of a door. This hinge remover holds a hinge mechanically to a door frame yet uses a propellant actuated mechanism to release the mechanical hold thus separating a leaf of a hinge from the frame, allowing for removal of the door quickly. This hinge remover bolts into an opening of an existing door frame and allows for command ignition either manually or automatically.Generally, the propellant actuated hinge remover has a thick base, generally cylindrical with a central opening and a flange, a hollow cylindrical wall upon a yoke, and two spaced apart shoulders upon the yoke. The shoulders receive a pin to hold a door. The wall receives a spring and a head upon the spring. The wall also has two diametrically opposed recesses that receive ball bearings of suitable diameter for the recesses. The central opening of the base admits the piston with the head upon the spring extending opposite the yoke. Opposite the flange, the central opening narrows in diameter and forms a chamber that accepts a propellant. Opposite the flange and the chamber, the central opening narrows a second time to form a fill hole for loading of propellant into the chamber. A cap closes the fill hole further, the fill hole also allows insertion of a rod that compresses the spring during assembly and disassembly of the invention where the ball bearing drop within the piston as the hinge assembly slides into or out of the body. Extending radially from the chamber, the base has a slot that opens upon the exterior of the base inwardly from the flange. The slot accepts an igniter that maintains contact with the propellant. During assembly of the invention, the head is compressed upon the spring against the yoke outwardly revealing the recesses in the cylindrical wall. Then the ball bearings are placed into the recesses and the head is eased inwardly securing the ball bearings into the recess and the head within the base. The present invention installs upon the Stealth Reconnaisance Assault Transport System—SRATS—though the Applicant foresees installations on other vehicles and facilities.There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood and that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. The present invention also includes an O-ring, propellant, and a chamber with stepped inward diameters. The propellant may include diluted RDX. Full strength RDX is a high explosive that serves as a boosting ingredient in select solid propellants. RDX does create an explosive force but without enough sustained gas pressure to move the piston through a stroke that would remove it from the housing. RDX though causes a shockwave that travels at 8000 meters per second damaging the hinge assembly at rest before the assembly moves at all. Additional features of the invention will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims attached.Numerous objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description of the presently preferred, but nonetheless illustrative, embodiment of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Before explaining the current embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also, the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.One object of the present invention is to provide a hinge remover that separates its two major components rapidly.Another object is to provide such a hinge remover that remains dormant during typical road and off-road travel.Another object is to provide such a hinge remover that utilizes an energetic propellant actuated device rather than a pure explosive.Another object is to provide such a hinge remover that remains safe from projectile impact.Another object is to provide such a hinge remover that utilizes a propellant safe from a 0.30 caliber projectile.Another object is to provide such a hinge remover that fires readily upon battery power of a vehicle or other installation.Another object is to provide such a hinge remover that functions in the range of 0.018 to 0.050 seconds.Another object is to provide such a hinge remover that has a low cost of manufacturing so the purchasing units and organizations can readily buy the hinge remover through existing supply channels.These together with other objects of the invention, along with the various features of novelty that characterize the invention, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and the specific objects attained by its uses, reference should be had to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which there is illustrated a preferred embodiment of the invention.The same reference numerals refer to the same parts throughout the various figures.The present art overcomes the prior art limitations by providing a propellant actuated hinge remover that separates a hinge from a frame typically of a vehicle for land or sea, and upon select building doors.  shows the propellant actuated hinge remover  installed upon a frame F. Preferably, the invention installs upon a vehicle frame such as a tank, other armored vehicle, or MRAP. Alternatively the invention installs upon a frame to a room or compartment such as a bunker, vault, ship passageway, or strong room. This description continues with reference to a vehicle frame while incorporating usage of the invention upon a frame to a room. The remover  connects to a door D, here shown partially, with at least one pin P secured within the remover  upon which the door D pivots.Proximate the door, the remover  has a yoke  with a generally elongated shape, here shown as rectangular. The yoke has a length similar to the portion of the door D, such as a leaf, that pivots within the remover. Generally symmetric, the yoke has two spaced apart shoulders . Each shoulder has a width and a thickness outwardly from the yoke towards the door. The width and the thickness exceed the diameter of the pin P inserted into the shoulders. The width and the thickness of the shoulder resist the torsion, bending moment, and shear forces imposed by the door to the remover . The pins occupy a hole in each shoulder where the hole has a length generally parallel to the surface of the frame. The shoulders are generally spaced apart for turning of a portion of the door.Opposite the shoulders, the yoke has a wall , later shown as cylindrical in shape, here shown as two parallel segments, The wall extends away from the yoke more than the thickness of the shoulder, generally at least twice the shoulder thickness. The wall is generally hollow as shown by the spaced apart segments, each segment having a thickness slightly less than the yoke thickness. Proximate the yoke, the remover includes an O-ring  that seals the wall  of the yoke to the remainder of the invention. The wall has a rounded groove , here shown as two recesses, well away from the shoulders, generally proximate the end of the wall, inwardly to the frame. The recesses, of the groove, are mutually spaced apart and each recess has a generally round shape that receives a ball bearing . When placed in the recess, the ball bearings secure the wall within the remainder of the remover. Preferably, the remover has four ball bearings  generally equally spaced about the wall. The ball bearings seat within swaged holes by a drill point in the wall.Within the wall , the yoke has a stub generally centered inside of the segments and proximate the yoke. The stub receives a biasing member, or spring , that expands outwardly from the yoke generally parallel to the segments of the wall. Opposite the stub, the spring fits within a head . The head has a hollow end that receives the spring upon its own stub Opposite its hollow end, the head has a solid face that abuts the remainder of the invention. The solid face though has a centered frusto conical chamber extending axially inward. This chamber channels the pressurized gasses of the combusting propellant for even application of force upon the head. The solid face has a material of sufficient thickness and hardness to resist an explosion and gas pressures of approximately 52,000 psi.Inwardly towards the frame from the yoke  and its wall , the remover  has its base  that has at least one flange, here showing two flanges . The flanges generally extend farther from the shoulders  of the yoke. As later shown, the flanges form a rectangular shape for securement to a frame. Each flange has its tapped hole that admits a screw in the frame F. The screws provide mechanical securement of the remover  to the frame during its operational lifetime. The screws also allow for removal of the base after an ignition of the propellant as later described. The base has a hollow interior formed from a central opening . The central opening extends inward from the flanges  towards the interior of the vehicle, that is, inwardly from the door. Similar to the wall , the base  has two portions, mutually parallel and spaced apart as shown. The portions have much greater thickness than the flanges and the yoke, approximately four times the flange thickness. The portions establish that the central opening has sufficient width and length to admit the wall . Slightly inward from the flanges, the central opening has a slot that admits the O-ring  as previously described. Much inwardly from the slot the portions have their section of the recess  from the wall. Their sections are generally rounded and a have a depth a mere fraction of the radius of the ball bearings . The sections primarily receive the ball bearings so that the ball bearings fit tightly between the wall and the sections without compression of the ball bearings.Inwardly from the ball bearings  and proximate the head , the central opening steps inwardly in width to less than the width of the head. This stepped inward portion of the central opening is the chamber . The chamber is also hollow and has a length of approximately 16% of the length of the base. Away from the head, the chamber opens to a fill hole  that extends furthest into the frame from the flange. The fill hole opens through a breech  of the base. The breech is generally opposite the flange and extends across the portions of the base. The fill hole  receives a cap  to contain the contents within the fill hole. The fill hole has threading that mates with threading upon the cap. The material of the cap has sufficient strength to resist the explosive pressures generated within the chamber. When the remover has been prepared for installation, the chamber contains a propellant  that combusts very rapidly, in the range of approximately 0.018 seconds through approximately 0.050 seconds. This range of times provides a device with negligible effects upon occupants of vehicle but slightly more time than with explosives. The propellant has a formulation that produces sufficient gas pressure to function the invention at its time of need, emergency egress of people. Typical solid or composite propellants contain a fuel component and an oxidizing component. Ignition of the fuel produces a very rapid thermo-chemical reaction producing heat and gases at high temperature. The fuel includes organics such as nitrocellulose or charcoal, vinyl, or explosives such as gun cotton, HNS, RDX, or PETN. includes and high energy composites such as RDX. Inorganic fuels include powdered metals such as iron, zinc, boron, magnesium, and others. Suitable oxidizers include ammonium perchlorate, potassium perchlorate, or nitrates of boron, barium or other elements, or oxides of iron, lead, or other elements. Regarding RDX particularly, RDX serves as a high explosive and see use only as an additive to more conventional propellants to boost their output energy. RDX therefore undergoes consumption as a fuel additive. Alone, RDX is a secondary explosive that requires a primary explosive, such as like lead azide or lead styphnate, to accumulate the explosive propagation velocity until the RDX achieves initiation energy to explode as a high explosive. RDX alone generally does not see use for generating pressure due to its risk of ancillary damage and shock. The present invention utilizes various formulations of propellants that begin with a fuel/oxidizer combination. The propellant of the invention seeks to create the pressure time relationship to compress the locking piston, unlatch the mechanism, and provide the heat and gas pressure to drive the hinge attachment free of the body of the invention. The propellant may have a pelletized form that allows for unlocking of small grains, overcoming of inertia in the invention and related door, and for larger grains that sustain the chamber pressure as the volume increases with the stroke.The present invention foresees using between 0.01 pounds to 5 pounds of propellant. In the invention, the propellant has sufficient weight to eject the yoke from the wall without leaving any residual amount of unburnt propellant. During ejecting of the yoke, the yoke bears a portion of the weight of an attached door. Such doors may have various weights ranging from a light armored vehicle door to a heavy armored door upon a fixed bunker of classified storage room. Heavier doors call for additional weight of propellant or propellants with greater foot*pound per pound ratios.Off to one side, the chamber has an elongated aperture  that extends radially from the center of the chamber through one portion of the base, here shown as The aperture receives an igniter  that contacts the propellant or a blasting cap if needed and extends outwardly from the aperture proximate the surface of the base. The igniter may have two prongs suitable for connection to electrical wiring or other control mechanism. Preferably, the igniter fires from battery power, typically off of a vehicle. Battery power provides nearly constant power in contrast to capacitor discharge that once used takes a long time to recharge. Capacitor discharge does not allow for a second use upon a failure of the igniter the first time. Alternatively, the igniter has a safety  that covers it outwardly from the base.Moving to , the remover is shown in an exploded view. The remover  begins with the yoke  shown as rectangular with a narrow lateral axis and an elongated longitudinal axis The longitudinal axis orients the yoke generally upright, that is, perpendicular to the surface upon which a vehicle travels. Spaced apart and outwardly, the yoke has two shoulders . Each shoulder has a thickness exceeding that of the yoke and slight less length than the spacing between the two shoulders. Each shoulder then has a hole extending through it generally parallel to the longitudinal axis The hole has a diameter sufficient to admit a pin P of a door in a generally snug fit. Centered upon the yoke and opposite the shoulders, the wall  has a generally cylindrical shape with a diameter slightly less than the spacing between the shoulders. As previously described, the wall extends away from the yoke a substantial distance, well more than the thickness of the yoke as shown. Opposite the yoke, the wall has its inner end that enters the central opening  of the base  of the assembled remover . Slightly inward along the wall from the inner end, the wall has at least two recesses  that each receives a ball bearing . Each recess is round and each ball bearing is spherical. The diameter of the recess and the ball bearing are identical. The recesses extend through the wall segments providing access to the hollow interior.Slipped over and along the wall, the remover includes the O-ring  with an inner diameter slightly less than the outer diameter of the wall. The O-ring  fits within the slot of the base. Then the inner end of the wall accepts the spring . The spring has a length when unstressed that places the solid face of the head flush with the inner end of the assembled remover. The spring also has a spring constant, or k, that keeps the spring rigid during normal vehicle movement yet allows the spring to compress upon ignition of the propellant. The spring has sufficient diameter to avoid breakage during an explosion. The spring then fits within the head . More precisely, the spring enters the hollow end and extends into the head until it abuts the stub not shown. The head is generally cylindrical and of a lesser diameter than the outer diameter of the wall and of an identical diameter to the inner diameter of the wall. Opposite the hollow end, the head has its inner faceAs shown outwardly from the inner face the remover  has the propellant . Though shown in cylindrical form, the propellant takes the shape of the chamber . As previously described, the propellant can be a powder or a solid capable of rapid burning. Outwardly from the propellant as shown, the base  collects the components of the invention for installation as a unit upon a door frame. The base is generally cylindrical with an opening  upon one end and the fill hole upon the opposite end, not shown. Proximate the opening, the base has a flange  here shown as rectangular and generally perpendicular to the length of the base. The flange has at least two holes through it, mutually spaced apart, that receive screws, bolts, rivets, or other mechanical fasteners. The fasteners secure the remover  to the door frame and remain secured during and following ignition of the propellant. Though a rectangular flange is shown, round, square, or elliptically shaped flanges are foreseen. Inwardly from the flange , the opening  has the slot that receives the O-ring  placed around the wall  inwardly from the yoke . The slot extends around the internal circumference of the central opening.Nearly opposite the flange , the base has the aperture  slightly inward from the breech . The aperture extends radially outwards through one portion of the base, here shown as the upper portion. The aperture has an inner diameter forming a hollow cylindrical shape. The aperture extends from the chamber to the surface of the base. The aperture has a countersink at the surface for reception of a safety, not shown. The igniter  fits into the aperture and extends from the propellant to slightly outside of the surface of the base.The breech  includes the fill hole, generally centered therein and the cap  closes the fill hole. The cap, the chamber, the inner face of the head, and the end of the igniter cooperate to retain the propellant in the base. The igniter in contact with the propellant provides the impulse of energy to start combustion of the propellant upon command.Having described the components of the invention, the invention assembles by placing the O-ring  into the slot Then an end of the spring is placed upon the stub within wall and the head is placed upon the other end of the spring. The head is then pushed inward towards the yoke, allowing for insertion of the ball bearings  into the recesses of the groove . The ball bearings are less than fully inserted so that the ball bearings are flush with the exterior of the wall. Preferably, the recesses do not pass completely through the wall but stop short of doing so. The recesses each have a residual drill point remaining proximate the bottom or interior of the recess. The residual drill point prevents a ball bearing from passing completely through the end of the recess. Generally following placement of a ball in a recess, the wall has the residual drill point material staked over which disrupts enough material to prevent the ball from falling out of the recess. Therefore, with the locking piston and spring in place, the yoke can be moved to the central opening  and into the wall. During assembly, a worker compresses the spring utilizing a rod just enough so that the balls fit into the cooperating depressions of the locking piston. Where once the balls enter the chamber, a worker pushes them past the O ring for camming into the locking groove by the spring force applied against the locking piston. For disassembly of the invention, a worker inserts a rod through the fill hole and pushes the locking piston against the spring thus compressing the spring enough for camming the balls out of the groove thus unlocking the yoke from the wall for removal.In an alternate embodiment, a band, tape, or adhesive temporarily holds the ball bearings inwardly and upon the inner face of the head. With the head and ball bearings assembled into the wall , the head, with the yoke following, is inserted into the central opening  within the O-ring. The insertion is generally quick to avoid the ball bearings extending fully into the O-ring. The wall is advanced fully into the central opening of the base so that the yoke abuts the flange and the ball bearings extend fully outwardly allowing the inner face of the head to abut the chamber. Propellant is then loaded through the fill hole as much as possible and the cap is emplaced in the fill hole. This loading does not fill the chamber so additional propellant is loaded through the aperture until the chamber fills completely. Then an igniter is installed in the aperture so that it makes contact with the propellant. A safety remains on the igniter to prevent premature ignition of the propellant and activation of the remover. The base is then placed in a prepared opening in the door frame and secured by screws through the holes in the flange. Then a door pin is emplaced through a hinge leaf to attach a door. With installation complete from a mechanical perspective, the safety is removed and the igniter connected to a command source, generally an electrical circuit, not shown.Most of the time during usage, the remover remains dormant. However, when an emergency occurs, a person, or a select sensor, inside of the door frame issues a command to the igniter that sends a spark or concussion into the propellant. The propellant ignites and burns rapidly creating heated gases inside the chamber. The heated gases seek to expand outwardly from the chamber though thwarted in that effort by the cap  and the igniter . The heated gases though supply pressure against the inner face of the head. Upon complete combustion of the propellant, the heated gases press the head against the spring so that the spring compresses and the head moves towards the yoke. When the inner face of the head passes the inside edges of the recesses, the ball bearings fall out of the recesses within the wall. This allows the remaining gas pressure to eject the wall with the yoke outwardly from the base and the frame of the door. By ejecting the yoke, the remover separates the pin of the door hinge from the frame allowing for the door to detach from the frame quickly. With the door detached, people can exit from behind the door in a timely manner to avoid an emergency.From the aforementioned description, a propellant actuated hinge remover has been described. The remover is uniquely capable of providing a hinged connection for a door to a frame that rapidly separates a yoke joined to a wall from a base using a propellant. The wall remains secured to the base using mechanical means until an emergency triggers combustion of the propellant to release the mechanical means, allowing for separation of the hinged connection. The hinge remover and its various components may be manufactured from many materials, including but not limited to, steel, cast iron, aluminum, polymers, high density polyethylene, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, their alloys, and composites.As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention. Therefore, the claims include such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and the scope of the present invention."

                "1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to the field of internal combustion engines. More specifically, the invention comprises a flexible magnetic belt configured to attach to a can-type oil filter in order to attract and retain metallic particles circulating in the oil.2. Description of the Related Artshows a prior art can-type oil filter . Can  is attached to mounting flange  by any suitable method—such as roll crimping. Flange  incorporates conventional features allowing oil filter  to be attached to an internal combustion engine. Threaded outlet  is surrounded by a plurality of radially spaced inlets . O-ring  surrounds threaded outlet  and inlets .shows a sectioned elevation view of the filter shown in  installed on an internal combustion engine. Engine block  includes a threaded mounting spindle , which is configured to engage threaded outlet  on oil filter . The user installs the oil filter by spinning it onto mounting spindle . This action compressed O-ring  and O-ring  against engine block , creating a positive seal.Pressurized oil is fed into inlet manifold , from whence it flows through inlets  into can . The oil is then forced to flow through filter media  and into intake cylinder  through ports . From this point the oil flows up through outlet  and thereafter circulates through the engine.All the features thus described are well known to those skilled in the art. Oil filters in present use contain a variety of internal features and the specific structure shown in  is properly viewed as being one example among many possibilities.It is well known that mechanical forces within internal combustion engines create loose meal particles (“filings”) which circulate in the moving oil. These filings can damage the engine. As the metal particles are usually ferromagnetic (steel or iron), prior art devices have uses magnetism to capture them.Typical prior art devices use a magnetic sleeve which is sized to fit closely around the external diameter of can . Unfortunately, oil filter cans come in a virtually endless variety of sizes. A specific magnetic sleeve must be provided so suit each size or range of sizes. It is therefore desirable to provide a method of magnetically capturing metal particles using a device which can be adapted for use in a wide range of oil filter sizes.The present invention comprises a method for capturing small metal particles within an oil filter can. The method uses a flexible belt incorporating a number of pockets. Magnets are contained within the pockets, with one magnet per pocket being preferable. The pockets are sealed so that the belt and magnets operate as a unified whole.The belt is wrapped around an oil filter and held in place via the attraction between the magnets and the metal oil filter can. No additional securing mechanism is needed. The belt may be wrapped around oil filters of various sizes with need for any alterations.The present inventive method attaches a flexible magnet belt to an oil filter in order to entrap metal particles circulating in the oil.  shows magnet belt  in an assembled state. The belt is flexible so that it may be wrapped around oil filters of different sizes. A plurality of magnet pockets  are provided along the length of the belt. Each pocket preferably contains one or more magnets.The magnet belt can be made in a variety of different ways.  illustrate one exemplary approach. Inner layer  is laid flat. A suitable number of magnets (in this case plate magnets ) is then place don top of inner layer .Outer layer  is then placed over inner layer  and plate magnets . It is desirable to retain the plate magnets in an even spacing. In order to do this each plate magnet is contained within a pocket in this embodiment.is a section view through the completed assembly shown in . The reader will note that outer layer  has been attached to inner layer  along seams , thereby creating pockets .is a perspective view of the same assembly. Seams  are formed around each magnet in order to isolate each magnet in its own pocket and retain it in the desired location along the length of the belt.The seams may be formed using any suitable technology, including: (1) stitching the inner and outer layers together; (2) using meltable materials for the inner and outer layers and melting the seams together; and (3) screen printing a suitable adhesive along the locations of the desired seams and pressing the two layers together so that the adhesive forms a bond. Other techniques will readily occur to those skilled in the art and the particular method used to create the seams and pockets is not critical to the present invention.Once assembled, the magnet belt is touch and durable.  shows magnet belt  in use in the present inventive method. The user wraps the belt around the cylindrical wall of oil filter . Because the oil filter's can is made of steel, the magnets within the belt adhere strongly to its exterior. The magnetic attraction alone is sufficient to retain the belt in the position shown during the operation of the internal combustion engine to which the oil filter is attached.shows a sectional elevation view through the oil filter with magnet belt  attached. The oil circulates through the filter as described in the prior art. However, metal particles  are retained within the filter via the magnetic attraction of magnet belt . These particles accumulate along the interior of cylindrical wall . Filter media  is able to retain larger metal particles on its own. The use of the magnet belt, though, retains much smaller particles and thereby enhances filtration.Returning to , the reader will observe that magnet belt  is not quite long enough to pass completely around the can of oil filter . The gap shown does not significantly affect performance. Thus, the belt may be used effectively on oil filter cans that are much too large for the belt to pass completely around.Of course, if a small diameter filter is present, the magnet belt may wrap around more than one complete turn and actually overlap itself. In this case, one end of the belt will overlie the other. The magnets in the overlapping portion will then align with the magnets in the portion beneath. The flexibility of the material used for the inner and outer layers of the belt allows the magnet to move laterally so that this alignment occurs with no action by the user. The flexibility also allows the user to bunch the magnets closer together so that the spacing between magnets can be varied to suit different filter applications.Those skilled in the art will know that an oil filter can is subjected to high temperatures (45 to 95 degrees Centigrade), vibration, dust, and other hazards. The materials for the belt should be selected with these hazards, in mind. High temperature, flexible plastic sheeting is suitable. A flexible, UV-resistant polyvinyl chloride is one example of a suitable material. Many other natural and synthetic materials could be substituted. Likewise, any adhesive used to bond the layers or thread used to stitch the seams must be suitable for the environment. Silicone-based adhesives are one good example.Although the preceding description contains significant detail, it should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but rather as providing illustrations of the preferred embodiments of the invention. The inventive method could be realized in many different ways. As one example, inner layer  and/or outer layer  may be formed of multiple pieces rather than one piece of continuous material. For instance, outer layer  could be seven individual pieces—with one piece being present for each pocket. Thus, the examples provided are properly viewed as embodiments of the invention rather than a definition of the invention's scope."

                "This patent application relates to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/305,266 filed on Feb. 17, 2010 entitled “Scalable Common Interface Plate System (SCIPS)” which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.The present invention relates to a scalable common interface plate system for use with robotic manipulators.Many space robotic manipulator designs to-date have been especially accommodating with respect to allowable interface misalignments. While this requirement has the obvious advantage of a generous capture window, it has also imposed considerable mass penalty and a high level of complexity on the manipulator's end-effectors. Current generation robotics performing operations local to the manipulator (i.e. on a common structure) can be expected to have significantly better alignment prior to capture and would as a consequence deem most of the end-effector's misalignment tolerance as superfluous.With this situation in mind, it would be very advantageous to provide a new interface configured to provide a light-weight, low cost alternative for applications not requiring the full capabilities of traditional snare rigidize end-effectors which tend to have high mass and superfluous capture misalignment capabilities.The present invention provides a low profile, compact, scalable concept end-effector for use in robotic handling applications. The end-effector acts as the interface between a multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator and its base (if applicable), as well as the tools it handles and is compatible with both large manipulator systems such as the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) and Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) and smaller dexterous manipulators such as the Orbital Express Dexterous Manipulator System (OEDMS class) manipulators. An active/controlled component is attached to the roll joint(s) at one or both end(s) of the manipulator, with an entirely passive component attached to the structure/tools that the manipulator interfaces with.Interface engagement and mate operations are performed by way of the manipulator roll joint. Once mated, shear pins are extended to lock the mated assembly in place and achieve a high stiffness, zero free play mated interface.Thus, there is provided an embodiment of a scalable common interface plate system for use with a robotic manipulator, comprising:a) an active base interface plate including a housing structure, said housing structure including a base plate and a top plate, said top plate having attachment points for affixing to said robotic manipulator, said active base interface plate including a locking mechanism mounted in said housing structure on an internal side of said base plate, said locking mechanism including at least one wedge protruding through an aperture in said base plate, said locking mechanism including at least one locking pin and an actuator for extending and retracting said pins; andb) a passive base interface plate including a first and second side, said first side having attachment points for attaching said passive base interface plate to an object, said passive base interface plate including at least one slot through which said at least one wedge can be inserted and withdrawn, said passive base interface plate including at least one pin hole on said second side for receiving said at least one locking pin, said first side including at least one complementary surface associated with said at least one slot, said complementary surface being contoured for receiving said at least one wedge.In an embodiment, to perform a mating operation, said robotic manipulator having said active base interface plate affixed thereto maneuvers said active base interface plate such that said at least one wedge protrudes through said at least one slot and subsequently rotates said housing structure such that said at least one wedge contacts said complementary surface, at which point said actuator is commanded to extend said at least one locking pin into said at least one pin hole, such that said active base interface plate is mated to said passive base interface plate, andwherein to perform a demating operation of said active base interface plate from said passive base interface plate, said actuator is commanded to retract said at least one locking pin, and said robotic manipulator is commanded to maneuver said active base interface plate away from said passive base interface plate.The present invention also provides a method of mating an object to a robotic manipulator, said method comprising the steps of:providing an active base interface plate affixed to said robotic manipulator, said active base interface plate including at least one wedge protruding from said active base interface plate, at least one locking pin, and an actuator for extending and retracting said at least one locking pin,providing a passive base interface plate affixed to said object, said passive base interface plate including at least one slot and at least one pin hole,commanding said robotic manipulator to maneuver said active base interface plate affixed to said robotic manipulator towards said passive base interface plate such that said at least one wedge protrudes through said at least one slot,commanding said robotic manipulator to rotate said active base interface plate such that said at least one wedge contacts a bottom surface of said passive base interface plate, andcommanding said robotic manipulator to extend said at least one locking pin into said at least one pin hole.The interface disclosed herein is very advantageous in that it results in a high stiffness, low power, and compact end-effector design. It uses a barrel-cam component design which removes the need for mechanism brakes, while utilizing a sequencing of cam surfaces which enables multi-mechanism actuation from a single motor.A further understanding of the functional and advantageous aspects of the invention can be realized by reference to the following detailed description and drawings.Generally speaking, the systems described herein are directed to a scalable common interface plate system (SCIPS) for robotic systems. As required, embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein. However, the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary, and it should be understood that the invention may be embodied in many various and alternative forms.The Figures are not to scale and some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular elements while related elements may have been eliminated to prevent obscuring novel aspects. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention. For purposes of teaching and not limitation, the illustrated embodiments are directed to a scalable common interface plate system (SCIPS) for robotic systems.As used herein, the terms, “comprises” and “comprising” are to be construed as being inclusive and open ended, and not exclusive. Specifically, when used in this specification including claims, the terms, “comprises” and “comprising” and variations thereof mean the specified features, steps or components are included.

It is not the intention to exclude embodiments such as these from the present invention.As used herein, the coordinating conjunction “and/or” is meant to be a selection between a logical disjunction and a logical conjunction of the adjacent words, phrases, or clauses. Specifically, the phrase “X and/or Y” is meant to be interpreted as “one or both of X and Y” wherein X and Y are any word, phrase, or clause.The interface described in this application is referred to as a scalable common interface plate system (SCIPS) which comprises an active base interface plate (ABIP) on the manipulator side and a passive base interface plate (PBIP) on the structure/payload side.  shows the general conceptual layout of the scalable common interface plate system shown generally at  which is intended to act as the interface between a multi-DOF (degree of freedom) manipulator  and its base, as well as the tools it handles and is compatible with both large shuttle remote manipulator system (SRMS) and space station remote manipulator system (SSRMS) and small orbital express dexterous manipulator system (OEDMS class or smaller) manipulators. In this way, the accuracy of the manipulator  can be exploited to the benefit of much lighter, simpler hardware while still addressing free-flyer capture (or other specialized) situations with a selection of available tools.An active base interface plate  is attached to each of the two roll joints  of the manipulator  while passive base interface plates  are attached to the structure at each of the desired manipulator base locations as well as to the tools and payloads that are to be picked up by the manipulator . The active base interface plate  includes two sets of interface wedges that engage with a corresponding set of complementary surfaces located on either a full-size passive base interface plate  (for large payloads, base operations, heavy tools, etc . . . ) or a reduced size passive base interface plate  (for small payloads, tools, etc . . . ).Interface engagement and mate operations are performed by way of the manipulator roll joint . Once mated, shear pins are driven from the active base interface plate  into the passive base interface plates  to lock the mated assembly in place and achieve a high stiffness, zero free play mated interface.General operation of the scalable common interface plate system is a staged operation similar to grapple operations employed with the power data grapple fixture (PDGF). Initial positioning and interface alignment is performed with standard manipulator operations assisted by a vision system integral to the active base interface plate . Initial engagement is performed utilizing the manipulator arm wrist roll joint  with final rigidization and connector actuation being performed by components within the active base interface plate . Connector engagement is optional.The active base interface plate  internal design is based on barrel-cam sequencing, therefore it is able to operate all mechanisms from a single rotational actuator. This design has the benefit of compact, light-weight packaging, low-power requirements and easy configurability with respect to mechanism stroke and timing. The active base interface plate  design provides capability for EVA (extra vehicular activity) actuation, as well as incorporation of the above-mentioned vision based capture system for either automated or human-in-the loop operational modes. The vision system provides sensing (image and a measure of the relative misalignment of the two plates) and this information is used to control the manipulator either in the human-in-the-loop control or automatic control modes.The passive base interface plate  design is compact and entirely passive in function; it is extremely robust in application and tolerant to the wide variety of environmental extremes encountered in space exploration (i.e. cold vacuum, lunar regolith, etc.). The passive base interface plate  contains no mechanisms or moving parts and, due to its relative simplicity, provides a very light weight robotic interface. The passive base interface plate  is flexible and allows both full-size (load constrained application) and reduced size (size constrained application) interface options.To facilitate vision based capture by active base interface plate  integrated vision system, the passive base interface plate  is marked to provide visual cues for both the automated and human-in-the-loop capture modes.The passive side of the present scalable common interface plate system, the passive base interface plate , is the complementary mating surface to the active base interface plate  and targeted as a low-profile alternative to the power data grapple fixture in non-free flyer capture operations. The passive base interface plate  economical design requires no electronics for actuation or keep-alive and contain no mechanisms and thus provides a low-cost, light-weight and robust alternative tolerant to significant environmental extremes.  shows a perspective top view of an embodiment of the passive base interface plate  and  shows a perspective bottom view of the passive base interface plate .The passive base interface plate  is preferably a machined disk  made of aluminum, specifically contoured to be complementary to the outer set of preload wedges forming part of the active base interface plate , (to be discussed hereinafter) as well as to reduce interface misalignments as the active base interface plate  and passive base interface plate  are brought together. Specifically, the passive base interface plate  includes slots  having three wedge surfaces , on the bottom surface of the plate , see . The passive base interface plate  includes three equally spaced holes  located on the top surface penetrating into the plate near the outer periphery of the plate , and spaced just in from holes  are smaller diameter tapered holes , see . Holes  are the holes for the mounting bolts used to affix the plate  to the mounting structure to which plate  is to be rigidly attached.A low-friction interface contact ring , seen in  (made of Vespel® (sold by Dupont) or nylon) near the outer periphery of the passive base interface plate  will reduce the required wrist roll joint torque during the interface preload portion of the interface mate operation.Interface preload results from the machined passive base interface plate  wedge surfaces  reacting against the active base interface plate's  preload wedges  as the wrist roll joint  is rotated. Alignment of the interface will be complete after engagement of tapered rigidization pins of the active base interface plate  into complementary collocated taper holes  in the top surface of passive base interface plate , see . The tapered rigidization pin design provides additional misalignment tolerance of the mated interface and, due to the preload developed in the rigidize pin deployment, helps to ensure a highly repeatable relative orientation of the two interfaces.Souriau plug connectors, if required for the application, may be rigidly installed to the passive base interface plate  body without accommodation for compliance (as compliance is already built in to the receptacle portion of the connection) or protective covers. Material selections for the body of the passive base interface plate  are driven by interface stiffness requirements and efforts to minimize mass, and therefore aluminum is preferred. To help reduce sliding friction of the wedge surfaces during preload, passive base interface plate  wedge surfaces  may have either a hard, high-tolerance surface finish (<16 μm) or dry film lubricant (i.e. Vitro-lube or Lubeco) applied thereto.shows a perspective view of the active base interface plate  looking at the bottom of the plate. Plate  includes a cylindrical housing  attached to a base plate  and three interface wedges  on the bottom of plate  that each engage with a corresponding set of complementary wedge surfaces  located on the passive base interface plate . Also protruding through the bottom of base plate  are three tapered rigidization pins . During the mating operation, once the wedges  have engaged wedge surfaces  in plate  pins  are inserted into complementary collocated taper holes .As mentioned above, and referring to , the mate/demate operations are enabled by way of transforming the wrist roll joint rotation into the interface preload. Interface preload is developed as wedging action due to the roll joint rotation driving the interface wedges  down (relative to the passive base interface plate  top surface), compressing a spring stack on which the active base interface plate  interface wedges  are mounted. The interface is ultimately locked in its preloaded condition by actuating the trio of drive pins  from the active base interface plate  into the holes  in passive base interface plate .Referring to , two electrical connectors  and  are attached to the outer surface of cylinder . Connectors for delivering data and power, if required for the application, may be integral to the passive base interface plate  body and positioned such that they are fully engaged at active base interface plate  connectors ,  end-of-stroke. The passive base interface plate  may be constructed in different sizes, for example, but not limited to two sizes in which one may be a full-size, high-stiffness interface to accommodate manipulator base operations and to interface with large tools/payloads (i.e. free-flyer end-effector tool) as well as a smaller available interface for tools and smaller payloads. Both designs accommodate a target/visual cue system to allow for either automated capture or human-in-the loop operational capture modes. The internal structure of the active base interface plate  is described in further detail below.shows a perspective view of the active base interface plate  absent the cylindrical housing . Three rigidization pin assemblies  are mounted on base plate , with each assembly  containing one of the three tapered pins  discussed above. A barrel cam assembly  includes an inner barrel cam ring , and an outer barrel cam ring  with the inner ring  and outer ring  separated by a barrel cam spacer ring . A toothed drive ring  is attached to the bottom of the inner barrel cam ring .Mounted on top of each pin assembly  is a rigidization pin follower  which are engaged in the cam track  of the inner barrel cam ring . An actuator/active base interface plate (ABIP) motor module  is mounted on the top surface of plate  which rotates a drive gear  which is meshed with the drive ring  for rotating the barrel cam assembly  and hence all three rings , and .A bearing support bracket  is mounted on the barrel cam assembly  and a large diameter roller bearing stack  supports the barrel cam assembly  on the interior of the outer casing . Three interface pre-load finger assemblies  are mounted on top of plate , and each supports one interface preload wedge .A connector cam follower  engaged into the outer cam track  of outer barrel cam ring  is connected to each of electrical connecters  and .Referring now to , the interface preload wedges  are mounted to the internal side of the active base interface plate  interface plate  via a pair of fixed linear bearing races  and will be oriented to allow limited vertical motion of the wedge  with respect to the active base interface plate  and interface plate . Each wedge  contains an enclosed pair of corresponding linear bearings  and will be isolated from the active base interface plate  structure by a bi-linear stiffness Belleville spring stack . The stack  includes a high travel, low stiffness section (for predictable interface preload) in series with a low travel, high stiffness section (for high interface stiffness). It is noted that it in operation, wedges  are neither extended nor retracted. They are suspended using the Bellville stack  and are forced up and down by their interaction with the mating surfaces  on the passive base interface plate  when the manipulator roll joint  is driven.Nominal interface preload will target 100% of the soft spring stroke to reduce any ‘deadband’ in the interface stiffness. Wedge travel of wedges  is limited in the negative direction by the available stroke of the bi-linear stiffness Belleville spring stack , while travel in the positive direction is limited by the available stroke of another low travel, high stiffness, rebound spring stack . The rebound Belleville spring stack  provides a compliant hardstop in the event of inadvertent contact of a given wedge and structure. At assembly, the springs  and  will be preloaded, positioning the wedge  in an equilibrium position resulting from the various spring stiffnesses.The scalable common interface plate system disclosed herein is advantageous in that it can be readily scaled to whatever size the application requires. For example, the passive base interface plate  may be scaled down to a smaller size for mounting on tools that need to be picked up using the system. The active base interface plate  can be scaled proportionately for use as an interface for picking up the tool. This smaller active base interface plate  can also be mounted inside a larger version of the active base interface plate  to produce a compound active base interface plate device which can be used as the mating device for either the manipulator base with a larger passive base interface plate  or for picking up tools with a smaller passive base interface plate . This version of the active base interface plate will have two concentric sets of wedge groups , locking pins , connectors and actuators. The outer set will be sized for the larger passive base interface plate and the inner set will be sized for the smaller passive base interface plate . Thus a large active base interface plate can interface to a large passive base interface plate, a small active base interface plate can interface to a small passive base interface plate. A compound active base interface plate device can interface to either a large passive base interface plate or a small passive base interface plate.shows a cross section of a rigidization pin assembly  which includes a housing  and a piston  having a cutout  for receiving the top section of tapered pin . Piston  has a channel  cut out of one side and a pin  mounted in housing  projecting into channel  so that as piston  moves up our down, the pin  hitting the ends of the top or bottom of channel  acts as hard stops and also prevents the rotation of the piston . A base  with holes  located therein allows pin assembly  to be bolted to base plate . Rigidization pin follower  is mounted in the top section of piston . A Belleville spring stack  is mounted around the top end of tapered pin  bearing against a shoulder  around the midsection of pin  and the bottom end of piston .Referring to , the connector and rigidize pin extend mechanism is composed of the active base interface plate  motor module (AMM)  ring gear , inner barrel-cam surface , outer barrel-cam surface  and the various necessary pin/connector cam sliders/rollers  and .The outer and inner barrel-cam surfaces  and  respectively will be rigidly affixed to each other and supported by the active base interface plate  housing  via large diameter roller bearing stack . Operationally, the cam surfaces will be rotated by the AMM  and a ring gear  mounted to the underside of the inner barrel cam ring . Cam surfaces  and  are coordinated to engage the rigidize pins  first (AMM  target drive Position ), followed by connector engagement if required (AMM  target drive Position ). Overall travel range of the pins , connectors and barrel cam assembly  are limited by cam surface design. The motion of the rigidize pin top portion will follow the cam surface and compress the Belleville spring stack  in line with the taper-tipped engagement pins  that interface to the passive base interface plate . The preload that develops between the cam surface and the taper-tipped component  will ensure a zero free play contact between the two taper surfaces.In operation, as mentioned above, the initial positioning and interface alignment may be performed with standard manipulator operations assisted by a vision system integral to the active base interface plate . Initial engagement is performed utilizing the manipulator arm wrist roll joint  with final rigidization and connector actuation being performed by components within the active base interface plate .The manipulator maneuvers the active base interface plate  either autonomously or under operator command to a position where the passive base interface plate  is within the range of the vision system. The manipulator is then commanded in vision guided mode to insert the active base interface plate  wedges  into the corresponding slots in the passive base interface plate  to achieve a ready to engage relative position and orientation. The manipulator wrist roll joint  is then commanded to cause the wedges  to engage with the corresponding mating surfaces  on the passive base interface plate  and achieve the required preloading of the Bellville stacks . At this point the rigidize pins  will be sufficiently aligned with the corresponding tapered holes  in the passive base interface plate  to guarantee engagement. The motor module  is now commanded to Position  to cause the rigidize pins  to engage with the tapered holes  and thus causing the interface to lock in place under a preloaded condition. The motor module  is now commanded to Position  to cause the connectors ,  to advance and mate with the corresponding mating halves mounted on the passive base interface plate  thus completing the mating operation. The demating operation consists of the following steps: The motor module  is commanded to Position  to cause the connectors ,  to demate. Then the motor module  is commanded to its standby position to cause the rigidize pins  to withdraw from holes  and cause derigidization of the interface. The manipulator roll joint  is now commanded to disengage the wedges . The manipulator is then commanded to maneuver the active base interface plate  away from the passive base interface plate  thus completing the demating operation.While the embodiments described herein describe three wedges , three slots , three pins , and three tapered holes , a different number of wedges, slots, pins, and holes may be employed. Further, those skilled in the art will appreciate that different actuators may be used to extend and retract pins  and electrical connectors , . Non-limiting examples of such actuators may include solenoids, dc motors, stepper motors, and pneumatic actuators. The above embodiments describe only a few examples of the various configurations and specific elements that may be used with embodiments of the present invention. As such, the listing of specific examples is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention has been presented to illustrate the principles of the invention and not to limit the invention to the particular embodiment illustrated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by all of the embodiments encompassed within the following claims and their equivalents."

These ladders can be used like a stepladder which can stand erect by itself when in use or can be “flipped” open to form a straight ladder for use when leaned up against some surface such as a wall. One limitation of flip ladders today is the lack of a tray for paint cans, tools etc. to be used when the ladder is in the stepladder configuration. The purpose of this invention is to provide a flip ladder having a tray attached to the ladder for use in the stepladder configuration. In addition, a means is provided to positively stow the tray out of the way of the user when the ladder is used in a straight configuration.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention pertains to a climbing apparatus that rests on a surface. The apparatus comprises a flip ladder that can move between a straight configuration and a stepladder configuration. The apparatus comprises a tray having a plane attached to the flip ladder that moves with the flip ladder between the straight configuration where the tray plane is essentially parallel with the ladder in a stowed position and a stepladder configuration where the tray plane is essentially parallel with the surface in an open position.The present invention pertains to a method for climbing. The method comprises the steps of moving a flip ladder between a straight configuration and a stepladder configuration. There is the step of moving a tray having a plane attached to the flip ladder from a stowed position where the tray plane is essentially parallel with the ladder to an opened position where the tray plane is essentially parallel with the surface.

                "This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a filter screen and apparatus for use with the method. The invention is especially concerned with filter screens for use in vibratory filtration equipment used for separating solids from muds used in oil drilling operations.Filter screens used in the field of this invention are described for example in WO95/23655, WO98/37988 and GB2388558. Typically tensioned wire meshes (wire cloths) are bonded to frames of plastic or metal reinforced plastic materials. The bonding may be by means of an adhesive or by heat softening the plastic surface of the frame and pressing the wire cloths into the softened plastic. Heating the wire cloths may be employed as the method of softening the plastic. After cooling a filtering screen having pretensioned mesh cloths is produced. Preferably two or more wire cloth layers of differing mesh size and wire diameters are employed in a screen. For optimal performance these are pretensioned individually to ensure the correct tension. In some cases they may be pretensioned to different extents.Careful tensioning of the wire cloths to selected tensions and avoidance of creases or other defects in the tensioned cloths of the filter screens produced is required to avoid loss of screening performance and early failure (holing) of the screens.Various means of gripping the edges of wire cloths and then applying forces to tension the cloth across a screen frame before bonding thereto are known. Typically a number of clamps are employed to grip the edges of the wire cloth and the clamps are driven (for example pneumatically or mechanically) outwardly of the screen frame to achieve the desired tension. Tension is applied in orthogonal directions to ensure the apertures in the mesh are kept open in the tensioned mesh. The gripping of the cloths should be arranged to allow the tensioning process to occur without slippage of the cloths in the clamps and consequent loss of control of the tension. At the same time the grip should not damage the cloth to the extent that tearing can occur.It is an object of the present invention to provide methods and apparatus for manufacturing filter screens that avoid or at least minimise one or more of the aforementioned problems.According to a first aspect the present invention provides a method of manufacturing a filtering screen comprising:attaching handle members to edges of at least one wire cloth;\n\nproviding a jig comprising tensioning means;\n\nplacing the at least one wire cloth in the jig and engaging the handle members with handle member engagement portions of the tensioning means;\n\noperating the tensioning means to drive the handle members outwardly to tension the wire cloth in orthogonal directions;\n\npressing the tensioned wire cloth against a screen frame;\n\nbonding the wire cloth to the screen frame; and trimming the wire cloth.The wire cloth may be tensioned before being pressed against the screen frame. In this case the screen frame may be raised from below to press against the tensioned wire cloth or lowered to press down on the tensioned wire cloth.Alternatively the tensioning step is carried out with the wire cloth being tensioned across the screen frame i.e. the screen frame is pressed into the wire mesh as it is tensioned across it. In this case the screen frame may be located in the jig and the wire cloth laid across it before engagement of the handle members with the tensioning means.The method may be employed to fit wire cloth to more than one screen frame at a time. Two or more screen frames may be pressed against a wire cloth simultaneously and then bonded to it.According to a second aspect the present invention provides handle members for use in the method of the invention.According to a third aspect the present invention provides an apparatus comprising a jig having tensioning means for use in the method of the invention.The screen frame may be of a plastics material, a reinforced plastic material or of plastics coated metal. Other materials may be employed, for example metal or wood.Bonding between the screen frame and the wire cloths may be by means of an adhesive, in which case the amount of pressing of the wire cloth to the frame may be just sufficient to ensure good contact between the wire cloth, the screen frame and the adhesive layer. Where the frame comprises plastics, bonding can be by heat softening the plastic surface of the frame so that pressing the wire cloth into the surface of the frame and allowing the heated material to cool embeds the wire cloth in the surface of the frame, bonding the tensioned wire cloth to the frame in the known manner. Advantageously, in the known manner, the wire cloth is itself heated so that when pressed against the frame it acts to soften the plastic material. For example a heated platen may be employed. Heat may be applied across substantially the whole surface of the wire cloth, or at least the whole area to be attached to the frame (i.e. excluding the parts to be trimmed off after the bonding step).Alternatively heat may be applied selectively, to those parts of the cloth that will form the bonds to the frame.The method may be used when producing a filtering screen comprising two or more wire cloth layers such as are often employed in apparatus for separating solids from drilling muds. If more than one wire cloth layer is fitted to the frame they may be joined to each other by common handle members before tensioning for bonding to the frame.Where such joining together of layers of wire cloth is used, the layers may be pre-tensioned before fitting the handle members so that all the wire cloth layers are free of creases relative to each other. The pre-tensioning and fitting of the handle members to the multiple layers of cloth may be carried out in a separate handle attachment apparatus or jig.However, especially where wire cloths of different mesh and wire size are employed, each cloth may have separate handle members attached. This allows wire cloths to be separately engaged by tensioning means on the jig, and thus separately and selectively tensioned.The screen frame may have a rectangular shaped periphery with a lattice of intersecting bars in between. In which case the wire cloth or wire cloths may be bonded to both the surface of the periphery and to the surface of the lattice. Any type of screen frame suitable for supporting a wire cloth may be employed, including substantially flat plates, typically of metal or plastics coated metal that are perforated to form a lattice work. The wire cloth is bonded to the lattice to form the filtering screen.The handle members are attached to edges of the wire cloths. Advantageously, all the edges of each wire cloth layer have at least one handle member attached. The cloth can then be securely gripped, for example by clamps of the jig or engaged by the handle member engagement portions of the tensioning means, at each edge of the cloth during the tensioning procedure.Typically each edge of a wire cloth will have several handle members attached, spaced at intervals along the edge. A separate handle member engagement portion of the tensioning means may engage each handle member. Such arrangements have the advantage of allowing the tensioning means to act independently at each handle member, thereby assisting in providing an even tension across the wire cloth. For example if the cloth is uneven or if the handle members are not attached to the cloth in a consistent manner along the edges.Alternatively a single handle member can be provided, on each edge of the wire cloth. The single handle member runs along substantially the whole length of the edge of a screen frame to which the wire cloth will be attached. In this case, to avoid creasing of the wire cloth the wire cloth may be pre-tensioned (in a separate handle attachment apparatus or jig), before attachment of the handle members. The pre-tensioning may be of the whole cloth piece bounded by the handle members or may be only of the mesh in the vicinity of each edge of the wire cloth. The pre-tensioning is to a tension similar to that employed when bonding the wire cloth to the screen frame.By attaching long single handle members along the edges of a pretensioned wire cloth, creasing along the edges of the mesh is avoided. After attachment of the handle members the wire cloth is removed from the pre-tensioning apparatus and can then be placed in the jig including the tensioning means with handle member engagement portions. It is then retensioned and subsequently bonded to a screen frame.Although this approach makes use of an additional apparatus, to pre-tension the wire cloth, it has some advantages. As only a single handle member is fitted to each edge of the wire cloth, only one handle member engagement portion is required at each edge of the jig. Tensioning of the wire cloth can be carried out by providing a single tensioning means at each edge of the jig, or as discussed below, at only two edges of the wire cloth. The reduction in complexity of tensioning means in the jig makes it easier to place the wire cloth in the jig, engage the handle members and carry out the tensioning and bonding to the screen frame steps.Furthermore when reduced numbers of tensioning means are employed at each edge of the jig the system is more compact, making it easier to provide separate tensioning means when two or more wire cloth layers are to be fitted to a screen frame. The multiple tensioning means can be located closer to the edges of screen frames, reducing the wastage of wire cloth when the handle members are removed at the end of the process.Generally screen frames are rectangular and the wire cloths fitted thereto have four edges. A separate wire cloth tensioning means may be provided along at least two adjacent sides of each cloth layer for orthogonal tensioning. The other two edges of the cloth may be held in clamps whilst the tensioning means operates.Alternatively a cloth tensioning means is provided for each cloth layer along each edge.Providing handle members attached to the wire cloths has a number of advantages. The handle members aid secure interengagment between the tensioning means and the mesh cloth avoiding slippage during the tensioning procedure that can occur where the tensioning means is secured to the mesh by clamps, which bite directly on the mesh.Additionally the handle members can evenly spread the load applied to the cloth avoiding tearing. Furthermore when locating the edges of two or three wire cloths in the clamps of tensioning means in prior art apparatus there are risks of creasing, misaligning or failing to properly locate the wire cloth edges in the clamps. This results in loss of control of the tensioning procedure. With the present invention handle members can be carefully attached to the wire cloths away from the crowded environment of the jig and its associated tensioning means. The handle members can then be positively engaged by the handle member engagement portions of the tensioning means ensuring consistent tensioning.The handle members are attached to the edges of the wire cloths. They may be attached by mechanical fittings. For example, pins pressing through the cloth connecting opposed parts of the handle member on either side of the cloth. Other mechanical means such as spring loaded clips, clamps or bolts and nuts may be used. Advantageously the handle members are bonded to the wire cloth, for example by an adhesive.Alternatively the handle members may comprise a plastics material which is heat softened to allow embedding of the mesh in a surface of the handle member in a similar fashion to that described for above bonding the cloth to the screen frame.After use in the manufacture of a filtering screen the handle members are removed when the excess wire cloth is trimmed. Alternatively the handle members may be removed before trimming the wire cloth. For example where the handle members are attached by mechanical fixing to the wire cloths they may be removed before the cloth is trimmed. The handle members may be reused if desired.The handle members and the corresponding engagement portions of the tensioning means are formed for interengagement, at least when tension is being applied to the cloth.For example the handle member may comprise an elongate bar of a plastic material attached to an edge of the wire cloth and the engagement portion may be a conventional clamp (mechanical, pneumatic or hydraulic) whose jaws grip the bar, thus spreading the load applied to the mesh during tensioning. Whilst such an arrangement can provide satisfactory results, the handle members and/or the engagement portions can be formed and arranged for a more positive and secure interengagement if desired.For example where the handle member is an elongate bar of plastic material as described above but the engagement portions of the tensioning means are clamps whose jaws close around the bar with the leading edges of the jaws inwards of the bar, (closer to the screen frame edge). As the tensioning means drives the jaws outwardly the leading edges of the jaws hold the bar captively, preventing slippage.Alternative arrangements can include a handle member that is shaped to engage securely in a correspondingly shaped recess or slot in the engagement portion of the tensioning means. For example the handle member may be wedge shaped. For example narrow nearer the screen frame and wider towards the edge of the cloth. The wedge is located in a corresponding recess of the handle engagement portion of the tensioning means when the cloth is not under tension, and securely interengages with the recess as the tensioning means drives the handle member outwardly of the frame.Yet further alternatives include handle members provided with hooks or loops for interlocking with corresponding hooks or loops of engagement portions.Advantageously the handle members are provided with slots for engagement with the engagement portions of the tensioning means. In use the engagement portions are located in or through the slots so that when the tensioning means are operated the engagement portions act against edges of the slots to hold the handle members as they are driven outwardly to tension the wire cloth. Where the handle members are provided with slots the engagement portions of the tensioning means may comprise pins which are sized to fit through the slots. This arrangement has the convenience that the handle members can be easily and correctly engaged with the tensioning means. The pins of each tensioning member hold the wire cloth in place until all the handle members are fitted and the tensioning process is begun.More advantageously where slots are provided, the slots are of larger dimension than the pins or other parts of the engagement portions of the tensioning means that fit in or through them, at least in the direction parallel to the edge of the wire cloth associated with the handle member (i.e. parallel to the edge of the frame to which the cloth is to be fitted).Providing handle members with slots of this form, elongate, in the direction of the edge of the frame, has the advantage of allowing some lateral movement of each handle member. Wire cloths are tensioned in orthogonal directions before bonding to a rectangular screen frame. The elongate slots allow creasing in the cloth (that may be present after tensioning has been applied in one direction) to be removed when the cloth is tensioned in the other, orthogonal, direction.A yet further advantage of this form of arrangement is that it can be compact, handle members comprising slots and engagement portions comprising pins take less space than other clamping arrangements, such as pneumatic or hydraulic clamps. For example, where two or three wire, cloths are fitted to a screen frame and each cloth is separately tensioned across the frame then the two or three separate sets of clamps and tensioning means, placed at each edge of the jig, must be spaced at some distance from the corresponding edge of the screen frame, because of their size. This is necessary to allow each cloth layer an uninterrupted path from the edge of the screen frame to its own clamp jaws and associated tensioning means. This arrangement results in significant wastage of wire cloth. The wire cloth between the screen frame edge and the relatively distant clamp jaws is cut away following the bonding step and is waste.With the use of handle members provided with slots and engagement portions comprising pins the distance between the screen frame edge and the engagement portions can be greatly reduced as illustrated hereafter with reference to a particular embodiment, resulting in substantially less waste of wire cloth.Other crease removing or inhibiting techniques can be used in the method of the invention if desired. For example the jig may be supplied with breaker bars along its edges such as are known in the art. These are bars running parallel to the edges of the screen frame over which the wire cloth is pulled during tensioning, providing a “break” between the tensioning means and the frame edge. The breaker bars act as a fulcrum to interrupt creases in the wire cloth formed at the tensioning means, preventing them from running onto the cloth stretched across the screen frame.As another alternative or additional crease inhibiting technique the method may include the fitting of crease inhibiting members to the wire cloth inward of the handle members as described hereafter.The tensioning means drives the handle members outwardly and hence tensions the cloth or cloths. The tensioning means may be of any form such as is known in the art. For example the tensioning means may include pneumatic or hydraulically driven pistons in cylinders to which handle engagement portions such as clamps are attached. Alternatively the tensioning means may be a screw turned manually or by a motor drive.The method of the present invention may be carried out manually but can conveniently be automated or semi-automated. For example wire cloth provided as a roll can be unwound, fitted with handle members, then tensioned in a jig and bonded to a screen frame or frames as described above. The excess wire cloth and handle members are then trimmed away. Some or all of these steps may be automated as desired.Conveniently where a roll of wire cloth (or wire cloths) is used in the methods of the invention the handle members are pre-fitted to the whole roll. Thus a roll of wire cloth, with handle members attached can be prepared in one location and then transported to the location where the screens are made, for unrolling and bonding to frames.shows a wire cloth , with only a portion of the mesh indicated by the hatching , for clarity. The wire cloth  is ready for tensioning.Handle members , in this example rectangular plastic blocks are bonded to opposed pairs of edges  and  of the wire cloth . A screen frame  is placed under the wire cloth . The screen frame is rectangular in form and includes opposed pairs of ends  and sides . A lattice of intersecting bars  is provided between the ends and sides ,  to support the wire cloth  when fitted to the screen frame .As indicated by the arrows A and B the wire cloth can be tensioned in orthogonal directions by pulling on the handle members  by tensioning means located in a jig (not shown for clarity). The tensioning in this example is carried out across the frame  (see ); so that the frame is pressed into the wire cloth  as the tensioning operation is carried out. The frame  is made of a plastics coated metal. Heating the wire cloth  and pressing it further into the frame  bonds the cloth  to the frame . The excess cloth, outside the frame , may then be trimmed away together with the handle members . The handles  may be reused.shows a detail in elevation of the frame  pressing against the wire cloth  during tensioning. Handle member  is gripped between the upper  and lower  jaws of a clamp, which constitutes the handle member engagement portion  of a tensioning means. The tensioning means is driving the handle member  and hence the wire cloth  outwardly in the direction of the arrow B by means of a pneumatically driven piston (not shown) which connects to the handle member engagement portion . By this means the wire cloth  is tensioned across the screen frame . In this example the handle member locates in a recess  of the upper jaw  and so is held captively during the tensioning process.An alternative, a wedge shaped handle member  is shown in . The wedge shape allows the jaws ,  to securely grip the handle member during tensioning.shows in plan view a handle member , of a plastics material. The handle member  comprises slots  which are elongate in the transverse direction (in a direction parallel to the corresponding edge of a wire cloth when fitted to it). A handle member engagement portion  suitable for interengagement with the handle member  of is shown in . The engagement portion  comprises a flat metal bar  fitted with short pins  that are sized to fit in the slots  of the handle member of . A rod  is connected to a piston in cylinder arrangement (see ) for driving the engagement portion .The plan view detail of shows a pin  of the engagement portion  of located in a slot  of the handle member of . As indicated by the arrow C transverse movement of the handle member  about the pin  can occur, even when the handle member and wire cloth  are tensioned in the direction of the arrow B. The slot  thus allows removal of creases from wire cloth  when tensioning the cloth in the orthogonal direction indicated by the arrow A.shows in elevation a detail of three wire cloths  being tensioned across a screen frame . Each wire cloth  has handle members  of the form shown in bonded to the edge of the wire cloth . Handle member engagement portions  of the form shown in engage the handle members  by means of the pins  on flat bars . Tensioning is applied in the direction of the arrow B by means of conventional pneumatically driven piston and cylinder arrangements  connected by the rods  to the metal plates . Each wire cloth can therefore be individually tensioned across the frame , about the edge  of the frame side . Once all the cloths  are correctly tensioned in orthogonal directions, heat can be applied, for example by a heated platen, to the cloths  to bond the cloths to the frame .The arrangement shown in is particularly compact as the handle members  and handle member engagement portions  can be substantially thinner than conventional clamping arrangements. This allows the tensioning means (engagement means , rods  and pistons in cylinders ), to be located only a short distance from the screen frame edge . Despite the short distance, the thin handle members  and engagement portions  allow each cloth  a clear uninterrupted path to the screen frame edge , ensuring that the desired tension is correctly applied across the frame . The short distance between the handle members  and the screen frame edge  means that there is much less wastage of wire cloth  when the edges are trimmed away (following the bonding step) than when using conventional clamps.shows in schematic plan view the edge of a wire cloth  fitted with handle members  being tensioned in the general direction of the arrows D. If the tensioning force and direction is not consistent or parallel at each handle member  then creases  can occur. These creases  may be removed where the handle members  have slots as shown in  and when the orthogonal tensioning is applied. Alternatively or additionally crease-inhibiting members  as shown in may be employed to inhibit crease formation. The crease-inhibiting members  are made of a resilient rubber or rubber like material and are bonded to the wire cloth  inward of the handle members . As shown in the crease-inhibiting members  may be sized to bridge the gaps  between adjacent handle members . Alternatively a continuous crease-inhibiting member  may be applied along each edge of the wire cloth. The crease-inhibiting members  act to reduce or prevent creasing by resisting stretching or narrowing of the gaps (as indicated by arrows E and F) by virtue of their resilient properties. A yet further alternative or additional means of inhibiting creases is the use of breaker bars as described hereafter with reference to .shows schematically the method of the invention applied when the wire cloth  is provided on a roll .The method illustrated is suitable for automation or semi-automation.In this example tensioning of the wire cloth  is carried out before pressing a screen frame to the tensioned cloth. A roll  of wire cloth  is pre-fitted with handle members  along the edges of the cloth.Additional handle members  are located across the width of the cloth in this example. The cloth  is pulled through a jig in the direction of arrow X and the handle members  on opposite side edges  of the cloth  are engaged by engagement portions (not shown for clarity) of tensioning means which include piston and cylinder arrangements  similar to those discussed above (). The wire cloth is then tensioned in the direction of arrows Y by the action of the pistons in cylinders .The handle members  of the front edge  of the cloth  and the additional handle members  are then engaged by tensioning means (see ) and orthogonal tensioning, in the direction of arrows X and Z is applied. Thereafter a screen frame (not shown) can be pressed onto the tensioned wire cloth mesh, inside the area bounded by the handle members ,, either from below or from above and a bonding step carried out. For example by applying a heated platen to the wire cloth, making use of a non stick element such as a PTFE sheet between the wire cloth and the platen to prevent inadvertent bonding of the mesh or the frame to the platen.After the bonding step the excess wire cloth and handle members are trimmed away and the process can be repeated by drawing the next section of cloth  from the roll .illustrates in elevation the engagement of handle members  of edge  and the additional handle members . Tensioning means of the form shown in and described above (comprising pins , flat metal plates , rods  and piston and cylinders ) are raised in the direction of arrow G to engage the handle members ,  which are provided with slots  to receive the pins . Tensioning can then be applied in the direction of arrows X and Z.The method described above can also be employed where two or three wire cloth layers are applied to a screen frame.The method may be modified in various ways. For example a screen frame may placed in the jig and tensioning and pressing to the screen frame carried out together as described above in respect of .For example the additional handle members  may be omitted and tensioning in the direction of arrows X and Z achieved by temporarily locking the roll  of wire cloth  to prevent unrolling. Tensioning means are then engaged with the handle members  along edge  of the wire cloth and activating the tensioning means provides the desired tension between the locked roll  and the handle members  at the edge .shows schematically a wire cloth  which is being held under tension in orthogonal directions (as indicated by the arrows A and B) in a pre-tensioning apparatus that makes use of a series of clamps and associated tensioning means . The clamps bite directly on the wire cloth . After tensioning the cloth  to the tension used when forming a filtering screen in a jig a single elongate handle member  is bonded along each edge of the wire cloth . The pre-tensioning ensures that the wire cloth is not creased. After attachment of the elongate handle members  the wire cloth is released from the clamps and tensioning means . The wire cloth  with handle members  attached can then be placed in a jig for tensioning and bonding to a screen frame as described before. The single handle member  along each edge of the wire cloth  means that the jig need only be provided with one tensioning means for each edge of each cloth layer to be fitted to a screen frame.shows an alternative pre-tensioning approach. The wire cloth  is pretensioned only in the vicinity of the edge , the area  bounded by the location of the clamps and tensioning means . The tensioning removes any creasing in the vicinity of the edge  (area ), following which handle member  is bonded to the wire cloth. The procedure can then be repeated along the other three edges ,, to attach a further three handle members without the wire cloth being creased. The wire cloth  with four handle members  attached can then be placed in a jig for tensioning and bonding to a screen frame as described before.illustrates in schematic elevation bonding of a wire cloth  to a frame . The frame  is a substantially flat, plastic coated perforated metal sheet and has been placed on a table  of a jig. The wire cloth is tensioned in the direction of the arrows A, across the frame  and breaker bars  of the jig. The breaker bars are rods running alongside the edges of the frame  that act to prevent creases, which may form on the cloth  near the handle members , from propagating across the cloth  where it contacts the frame . A heated platen  is then lowered onto the cloth  pressing it into the frame . The platen heats the cloth  causing melting of the plastic coating on the frame . On removal of the platen the molten plastic cools, bonding the cloth  to the frame ."

                "This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/859,172, filed Sep. 21, 2007. The disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference.The present teachings relate to a jigsaw and more particularly relate to an adjustable and removable keel attachment that can remain in line with a housing of the jigsaw, while a shoe member is pivoted relative to the housing.Typically, a keel blade can be attached to a jigsaw to provide a relatively more accurate straight cut through a piece of sheet material than a jigsaw without the keel blade. The keel blade is traditionally attached to and removed from a housing of the jigsaw using tools and multiple fasteners, which can be a relatively complex process. In some instances, the keel blade needs to be uncoupled from the housing to perform a bevel cut.The present teachings generally include a jigsaw that includes a housing containing a motor activated by a trigger assembly. A shoe member is pivotally connected to the housing and establishes an angle therebetween. The jigsaw includes a keel assembly that includes a blade member that generally extends from the housing beyond the shoe member. The keel assembly remains generally in line with the housing as the angle between the shoe member and the housing varies. The jigsaw also includes a latch assembly capable of retaining and releasing the keel assembly from the housing.In another form, the present disclosure provides a method of positioning a shoe member and a keel assembly relative to a housing of a jigsaw. The method may include securing the keel assembly to the housing so that the keel assembly extends from the housing beyond the shoe member. The housing and the keel assembly may be pivoted relative to the shoe member in a manner such that a position of the housing relative to the keel assembly remains unchanged. A portion of the keel assembly may be uncoupled from the housing.In yet another form, the present disclosure provides a method of positioning a keel assembly and a lower carrier assembly relative to a housing of a jigsaw, the lower carrier assembly having a lower blade guide. The method may include connecting the keel assembly to the housing so that the keel assembly extends from the housing beyond a shoe member. The keel assembly may be pivoted relative to the housing. A position of the lower carrier assembly may be adjusted relative to the keel assembly.In yet another form, the present disclosure provides a method that may include providing a jigsaw having a housing, a shoe member, and a keel assembly. The shoe member may be coupled to the housing and may be adapted to support the jigsaw on a surface of a workpiece. The keel assembly may extend from the housing beyond the shoe member. The method may also include connecting a carrier assembly to the keel assembly. The carrier assembly may have a lower blade guide that is adapted to support a blade member. The carrier assembly may be moved relative to the keel assembly from a first position to a second position. The carrier assembly may be secured to the keel assembly in the second position.Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present teachings.The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the present teachings, their application or uses. It should be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features.Moreover, certain terminology can be used for the purpose of reference only and do not limit the present teachings. For example, terms such as “upper,” “lower,” “above” and “below” can refer to directions in the drawings to which reference is made. Terms such as “front,” “back,” “rear” and “side” can describe the orientation of portions of the component, function, system, etc. within a consistent but arbitrary frame of reference which can be made more clear by reference to the text and the associated drawings describing the component, function, system, etc. under discussion. Such terminology may include the words specifically mentioned above, derivatives thereof and words of similar import. Similarly, the terms “first,” “second” and other such numerical terms referring to structures, systems and/or methods do not imply a sequence or order unless clearly indicated by the context.With reference to , a jigsaw  generally includes a housing  that can be formed of two half shells , . The housing  can contain a motor . When activated by a trigger assembly , the motor  can provide a reciprocating and/or pendulum motion to a cutting blade holder  on the end of a reciprocating shaft to drive a cutting blade  at one or more cutting angles  (). A control member  on a side of the housing  can control a rate of the reciprocation and/or a magnitude of the pendulum motion of the cutting blade holder  on the reciprocating shaft and thus the cutting blade .A shoe member  can be coupled to a bottom  of the housing  in such a way as to permit the shoe member  to pivot relative to the housing . As the shoe member  pivots relative to the housing , the cutting blade holder , the cutting blade , etc., can be orientated at various angles (i.e., one or more of the cutting angles  ()) relative to the shoe member . A bottom surface  of the shoe member  can abut a workpiece , which can be wood, plastic, metal, other suitable materials and one or more combinations thereof and can be in the form of pipe, sheet material, stock material, other suitable forms and/or materials and one or more combinations thereof. The shoe member  can be pivoted relative to the housing  to adjust the cutting angle  () of the jigsaw , e.g., at a forty-five degree cutting angle.As the shoe member  is moved relative to the housing , an angle indicator wheel  can be rotatably coupled to the shoe member  and can indicate the cutting angle  of the jigsaw . Further, a locking mechanism  can include a bevel lever  that can be adjusted between an unlocked condition and a locked condition, as shown in . In the unlocked condition the locking mechanism  can permit the shoe member  to pivot relative to the housing . In the locked condition, as illustrated in , the locking mechanism  can prevent the shoe member  from pivoting relative to the housing . The cutting angle  () to which the shoe member  can be pivoted relative to the housing , when the locking mechanism  is in the unlocked condition, can be indicated by the angle indicator wheel .A dust extraction port  can be formed on a rear portion  of the shoe member  such that a vacuum source  can be connected with various suitable connections to the dust extraction port . A dust extraction airflow  can be extracted from a cutting area . From the cutting area , the dust extraction airflow  can move through an airflow pathway formed in the shoe member  and directed out of the dust extraction port .The jigsaw  can include a laser module . The laser module  can project a laser light  and can produce a laser light pattern . The laser light pattern  can produce, for example, a sequence of dashes and/or dots beyond a front side  of the cutting blade  and can highlight a path of the cutting blade  through the workpiece .The jigsaw  can also include a keel assembly  that can provide additional straight-line accuracy when cutting a straight line in the workpiece  (e.g., can help avoid wandering of the jigsaw cutting path). The keel assembly  can be pivoted with the housing  when the shoe member  is moved at an angle (i.e., the one or more cutting angles  ()) relative to the housing . In this regard, the shoe member  can be pivoted relative to the housing  but the keel assembly  can remain generally in line with the housing  so as to provide, for example, a straight bevel cut through the workpiece , i.e., the cutting angle is not perpendicular to the workpiece  but the cutting path through the workpiece  is straight.The keel assembly  can be connected to the bottom  of the housing . The shoe member  can extend from the housing  beyond the shoe member  and distally outward (i.e., downward) from the bottom  of the jigsaw . The keel assembly  can include a keel blade member  to which a lower guide assembly  can be attached. The lower guide assembly  can be spaced at various predetermined distances from an upper guide assembly  that extends from the housing . By adjusting the lower guide assembly  relative to the upper guide assembly , the distance between the assemblies ,  can be adjusted to accommodate workpieces having different thicknesses.With reference to , The keel assembly  can also include a front connection portion  that can have a flange  in which an aperture  can be formed. The keel assembly  can further include a rear connection portion  that can define a lip . A rear connection portion  in the housing  can accept the lip  of the rear connection portion . In this regard, the rear connection portion  of the keel assembly  can be received by the rear connection portion  of the housing  so that the lip  can pivot about the rear connection portion  of the housing .As illustrated in , the keel assembly  can swing upwards so as to position the front connection portion  of the keel assembly  into engagement with a front connection portion  of the housing . The keel assembly  can also swing downwards when uncoupled from the housing  (illustrated in phantom line). When connecting the keel assembly  to the housing , the aperture  formed in the flange  can be accepted by a latch assembly  in the front connection portion  of the housing .With reference to , the latch assembly  can include an actuator member  that can be pushed, retracted or the like. In one example, pushing the actuator member  into the latch assembly  can move a post  so as to move the post  out of the aperture  in the flange  of the front connection portion  of the keel assembly . By way of the above example, the actuator member can be pushed by one or more fingers, thumbs, etc. of the user. With reference to , with the front connection portion  no longer held by the latch assembly , the keel assembly  can swing downward about the lip  that can be held in the rear connection portion . As such, the keel assembly  can be uncoupled from the housing  via a hand operation and therefore no tools are required to do so.In another example, pressing the actuator member  can release a bias on the post  so that the post  can move (e.g., retract) when the keel assembly  is pulled away from the housing . Notwithstanding the specific mechanism that can move the post , when the actuator member  is in the extended position (e.g., not pressed by a user), the post  can be held by the aperture  formed in the front connection portion  of the keel assembly  to secure the keel assembly  to the housing .With reference to , the keel assembly  can be secured to the housing  and the keel assembly  can remain in-line with the housing , while the jigsaw  is moved relative to the shoe member  to establish the various cutting angles . The one or more cutting angles  of the cutting blade  () of the jigsaw  are illustrated such that the cutting angle  (illustrated in solid line) is positioned at a zero degree cutting angle, i.e., a perpendicular cutting angle relative to the shoe member .In further aspects, a cutting angle  (shown in phantom line) can be positioned at about positive fifteen degrees, while a cutting angle  (shown in phantom line) can be positioned at about negative thirty degrees. A cutting angle  (shown in phantom line) can be positioned at about positive forty five degrees. It will be appreciated in light of the disclosure that various cutting angles can be implemented including, but not limited to, those cutting angles illustrated in . In one aspect, the keel assembly  can be removed from the housing  regardless and at any of the cutting angles implemented.With reference to ,  and , the keel blade member  can define a channel  in which the lower carrier assembly  can move to adjust the distance between the lower carrier assembly  and the upper carrier assembly . The lower carrier assembly  can include an adjuster mechanism . The adjuster mechanism  can include an adjuster member  that can be retracted against the bias of a spring . By moving the adjuster member , a plug member  having a cam surface  can move out of alignment with an edge  of the channel  formed in the keel blade member . When the cam surface  is moved out of alignment with the edge , the lower carrier assembly  can be moved between positions  relative to the keel blade memberIn one aspect, the positions  can include a top position , as shown in  and a lower position , as shown in  and again illustrated in phantom line in . By way of the above example, the different positions  of the lower carrier assembly  can be configured to accommodate varying lengths  of the cutting blade  for certain applications. In turn, the different positions  of the lower carrier assembly  can be implemented to accommodate differently sized workpieces.In another aspect, the plug member  can have a circular cam surface  that can be received by one of the pockets  formed from the edge  of the channel . While three pockets , i.e., a first pocket , a second pocket , a third pocket  are illustrated, it will be appreciated in light of the disclosure that varying amounts of the pockets  can be defined in the channel  in the keel blade member  and can be associated with the positions  of the lower carrier assembly .By moving the cam surface  out of contact with the edge  of the channel  formed in the keel blade member , the lower carrier assembly  can be moved relative to the keel blade member  to one of the selected positions . At one of the selected positions , the adjuster member  can be moved to an extended condition so that the cam surface  of the plug member  can again come into contact with the edge  of the channel  and thus hold the lower carrier assembly  in the selected position.With reference to , the lower carrier assembly  can include a pair of arm members  that can be fastened together with the keel blade member  in between the arm members . Each of the arm members  can include one or more apertures. For example, a rear aperture , a middle aperture  and a front aperture  can be formed on each of the arm members . The rear aperture  can accept a fastener  that can also be inserted into a groove  formed in the keel blade member . As the lower carrier assembly  is moved relative to the keel blade member , the fastener  can travel in the groove .One of the middle apertures  can be an oversized aperture (relative to other apertures)  on one of the arm members  so as to accept the plug member . The opposed middle aperture  on the opposite arm member  can accept a portion of the adjuster member . In this arrangement, the adjuster member  can be inserted through the spring  that can be disposed between a surface  of one of the arm members  and a head  of the adjuster member . The adjuster member  can couple to the plug member  (e.g., with mechanical threads) to secure the spring  between the head  and the surface . The front aperture  can accept a fastener  that can rotatably hold a rolling member  between each of the arm members . The rolling member  can be configured with a groove  to accept a rear edge  () of the cutting blade .The keel assembly  can further include a keel block  that can attach to the keel blade member . The keel blade member  can define a first protrusion  and a second protrusion . The first protrusion  can include an aperture  while the second protrusion  can include a second aperture . A portion of the keel blade member , including the protrusions ,  can be accepted within a groove  (shown in broken line) formed within the keel block . Fasteners  can be passed through apertures  formed in the keel block  and the apertures ,  formed in the keel blade member  near the keel blade member  to the keel block . In turn, the keel block  can connect to the housing , as partially shown in .With reference to , an upper carrier assembly  can include a rolling member  or other suitable member that can abut a rear (i.e., non-cutting) edge  of the cutting blade  of the jigsaw  in accordance with further aspects of the present teachings. From the upper carrier assembly , two guide members  can extend and can terminate at a position that almost touches a side  of the cutting blade . At ends  of each of the guide members , a hardened portion  can be positioned so that when the cutting blade  contacts the guide members , the cutting blade  can contact the hardened portions . Each of the hardened portions  can be harder than the material of which the guide members  are comprised.When the jigsaw  is cutting in a straight line and there is generally no twist imparted on the cutting blade , the sides  of the cutting blade  will not touch the hardened portions  of the guide members . In other instances, the cutting blade  can cut through a workpiece and twist can be imparted on the cutting blade  such that the twist of the blade can force the sides  of the cutting blade  into the hardened portions  of the guide members . In one example, twisting of the cutting blade  can be due to the cutting blade  following a grain of wood especially in wet (green) wood.It may be shown that keeping the guide members  and especially the hardened portions  in close proximity to the sides  of the cutting blade  can reduce the twisting of the cutting blade  and reduce deviations from a straight cutting line. As such, the ends  of the guide members  can be kept close enough to the cutting blade  to reduce the twist of the cutting blade  because the cutting blade  can be prevented from twisting (or twisting to such a degree) due to the hardened portions  that can at least partially obstruct the sides  of the twisting cutting blade .It will be appreciated in light of the disclosure that twisting can be due to forces between the cutting blade  and the workpiece  and not otherwise due to an optionally implemented scrolling functionality that can impart a twist on the cutting blade  to, among other things, make it relatively easier to turn the cutting blade in decorative cutting with the jigsaw.While specific aspects have been described in the specification and illustrated in the drawings, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes can be made and equivalents can be substituted for elements and components thereof without departing from the scope of the present teachings, as defined in the claims. Furthermore, the mixing and matching of features, elements, components and/or functions between various aspects of the present teachings are expressly contemplated herein so that one skilled in the art will appreciate from the present teachings that features, elements, components and/or functions of one aspect of the present teachings can be incorporated into another aspect, as appropriate, unless described otherwise above. Moreover, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation, configuration or material to the present teachings without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the present teachings not be limited to the particular aspects illustrated by the drawings and described in the specification as the best mode presently contemplated for carrying out the present teachings, but that the scope of the present teachings include many aspects and examples following within the foregoing description and the appended claims."

                "The present invention relates to closures of the type commonly used to retain pressure within a vessel, whether that be a tank or a pipeline. More particularly, the invention relates to a fast opening and highly reliable closure.Various types of closures have been devised, and many closures vary considerably in design depending upon the size of the closure and the pressure rating to which the closure is subjected. Closures are desirably fast opening and closing, and provide a reliable seal to maintain pressure within the vessel. Most closures are of the type wherein the door is threaded or otherwise mechanically secured to a hub, and is sealed to hold pressure. The internal pressure acts to push the door away from the hub, which may reduce sealing effectiveness.A rather complicated closure mechanism is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,439,415. U.S. Pat. No. 5,148,938 discloses an exterior stop, and a simple interference seal between the interior of the housing and the exterior of the door. U.S. Pat. No. 4,519,519 discloses a door with a stop exterior of the door, and a seal between the interior of the door and the body of the vessel. U.S. Pat. No. 2,721,094 discloses keys which move radially to lock the door in place or release the door. U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,051,897 and 7,036,674 disclose other embodiments of closures for a pressure vessel. Prior art closures of this type are generally expensive, and these closures frequently have detractions which have limited their use and acceptance.Various closures have been designed which utilize a door interior of a stop on the hub. This design thus utilizes internal pressure to press the door tighter against a stop. U.S. Pat. No. 3,667,649 discloses a design wherein the stops are removable. U.S. Pat. No. 3,449,860 discloses a door with retractable stops. U.S. Pat. No. 4,140,240 discloses a closure with stops external to the door.The disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by the present invention, and an improved closure is hereinafter disclosed.In one embodiment, a closure for a vessel comprises a hub having a access opening to the vessel, with the hub having a circumferential stop face and at least one recess extending radially outward from an adjacent outer surface of the hub. A door may be positioned between the stop face and the vessel, and a latch mechanism is provided for bringing the door into secure engagement with the stop face. A lug extends radially outward from an adjacent exterior surface of the door, such that a respective lug engages the hub in the vicinity of a respective recess when the door is sealed to the hub. The door may be moved out through the hub and between the one or more recesses.These and further features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, wherein reference is made to the figures in the accompanying drawings.illustrates one embodiment of a closure  according to the present invention. The closure includes a hub  having an access opening to the vessel, with this access opening generally being sufficiently large to accommodate a worker for access to the vessel, or sufficiently large to receive a pig for passing through a pipeline.  generally illustrates the hub  in sealed engagement with a portion of a generic vessel , which may be a pressurized tank or a pipeline, depending on the application.The hub  has a circumferential stop surface , as shown in , and a plurality of recesses , with one of the recesses shown in . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in a preferred embodiment the closure may be symmetrical, and thus another recess  is provided at a position circumferentially opposite the recess shown in . Each of the plurality of recesses  extend generally radially outward from the adjacent inner surface of the hub.The enclosure also includes a door  for positioning between the stop surface  and the vessel. A latch member , which may be of various varieties, is provided for bringing the door into sealing engagement with the stop surface. One or more lugs  each extend radially outward from an adjacent exterior surface  of the door, such that a respective lug engages the hub about a respective recess to seal the door to the hub. The lugs  move generally outward into a recess when in a locked position, and move generally inward to an unlocked position. The recesses  may extend generally outward to receive the lugs, but the central axis of each recess need not necessarily be in the radial direction. As explained subsequently, the door may be moved to pass through the plurality of recesses and out of the hub.illustrates the door  seated against the stop surface  of the hub. The door may be held in this position by tightening the wheel  on the threaded locking bar . The locking mechanism holds the door in position while the door is at a low system pressure. As system pressure increases, the pressure itself will hold the door in place with sufficient force to prevent accidental opening while the closure is in use. As shown in , an elastomeric seal  may be provided for fitting within a corresponding groove  in the door . Various types of seals may be provided, including metal or polymeric seals, and either gasket or lip seals, with the slip ? seals preferably being pressure energized. The seal is preferably annular, i.e., its path is over a circumferential length of 360°, although the configuration of the seal along this length need not be circular.illustrates an annular restriction  in the hub, which may be provided for various purposes. The outward end of the hub includes an annular stop member  which includes the stop face  previously described. Still referring to , a slidable mount  may be supported on to the hub , and may support block  thereon at a forward end of the slidable mount . Arm  extends radially inward from block , and supports a central block  to which the threaded rod  may be rotated, thus moving the pivot member  which is pivotally connected at one end to locking bar  and the other end to mounting bracket  on the door.The closure  can be opened after system pressure has been equalized to ambient. Referring to , the centerline of the locking bar  is preferably above the center of gravity of the door to provide natural stability. The hand crank  may be rotated so that the locking bar  and the door  are moved away from the stop surface . A simple bar may then be used to apply a slight force to the upper part of the door, so that the door is rotated to a substantially horizontal position, as shown in . While in this position, the lugs  may still be aligned with the recesses . In order to remove the door, the door  and the lugs  may be rotated, as shown in , so that the lugs  are out of alignment with the slots . The door may then be easily passed through the slots  and out of the hub, as shown in , after releasing a locking member to allow sliding movement of mount . The door is preferably balanced during this operation to allow ease of handling, and small jack systems may be used for doors which are heavy.Once the door has passed through the recesses , the door may be completely removed from the hub access by pulling on the sliding mount , so that the mount  is moved outward from the position as shown in  to the position as shown in . After a locking pin is disengaged, the door may be moved out of the way by pivoting the swing arm  from the sliding mount , as shown in . This allows easy access to the door for repair or maintenance operations. The door may be deployed in the closed position by reversing these steps.As shown in , a sealing element  may be provided within a gland or slot  in the door. Alternatively, the seal may be supported on the hub rather than the door. Sealing is assured when the door is in the closed position, since the seal moves axially to engage the stop surface, which is outward of the respective recess . Alignment lug  may be provided for assuring that the door is properly oriented with respect to the hub when closed.An alternate embodiment invention is shown in . In this embodiment, the door  has an elliptical or dome portion . This design allows the door to be hung at its center of gravity and requires less mass than a flat door for a given pressure load. The counterweight block also provides a door support , as shown in , although sealing engagement is preferably with the portion of the door that includes the elliptical shaped body . High and low pressure versions of the closure are possible with a minimum change in the design, and with no inherent change required in the hinging and locking mechanisms.For each of the embodiments, the center of the gravity of the door may be adjusted by adding counterweights, which may also be used for structural reinforcement. The door is preferably hung at or near the center of gravity for balance and ease of orientation, thereby allowing even heavy doors to be handled without use of powered mechanical equipment. The door preferably is hung so that its center of gravity is on, or is closely adjacent to, the centerline of the hub opening at all door travel positions. Preferably there is no need to raise or lower the door during operation of the closure.The closure of the invention is also inherently safe, and would practically require failure or rupture of the door or the hub. The closure also does not require high manufacturing tolerances, thereby resulting in a relatively low manufacture cost.Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the closure of the present invention is relatively fast in opening and closing, and that the operation of the closure need not depend upon the closure size or pressure rating. In a preferred embodiment, the closure provides a 360° face seal, which may be a simple compression seal or a lip-type seal. A significant feature of the invention is that the closure is secured in the closed position by internal pressure within the vessel. Various embodiments allow the operator to easily manipulate doors, including heavy doors, with relative ease.In a preferred embodiment, the door has a generally circular configuration, with that configuration interrupted only by the one or more lugs. Providing two such lugs and two corresponding slots radially opposing each other are preferred for many applications since the design is then balanced. It would be possible, however, to utilize a closure of the invention with a single slot and a single lug, although the center of the door may have to be moved laterally to pass out through the single slot. In yet other embodiments, the door could be provided which did not have a generally circular configuration, and instead had a oval or elliptical configuration. Pivoting of the door after axial movement would thus allow an elliptical door to pass out through the hub without the use of a lug or a corresponding recess.Those skilled in the art will appreciate the terms “slots” or “recesses” when referring to the opening in the hub and the term “lug” when dealing with the outwardly extending projections on the door are intended in their broadest sense. Lugs may also be termed ears, stops, projections, or tabs. Utilizing two recesses and two corresponding lugs facilitates ease of operating the closure.The closure of the present invention is particularly well suited for applications involving relatively high pressures, i.e., pressures in excess of 5,000 psi. Increased pressure forces the door into tighter engagement with the stop surface, which increases the sealing effectiveness of the closure. The lugs extend radially outward from the generally circular periphery of the door, although the centerline of each lug extension may include a circumferential segment, so that the centerline of the lug is spaced from the centerline of the hub.Although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein in some detail, this has been done solely for the purposes of explaining the various aspects of the invention, and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the claims which follow. Those skilled in the art will understand that the embodiment shown and described is exemplary, and various other substitutions, alterations and modifications, including but not limited to those design alternatives specifically discussed herein, may be made in the practice of the invention without departing from its scope."

                "The field of this disclosure is filter systems. More specifically, the field is canister filter systems for liquids, such as lube oil or liquid fuels, which have drains for draining liquid out of the canister.Canister filter systems are used extensively today on equipment such as internal combustion engines, construction and mining machinery, and many other types of industrial machinery. They are used to filter contaminants from fluids in fuel systems, lubrication oil systems, hydraulic fluid power systems, hydraulic fluid control systems, transmission fluid systems, engine air intake systems, and the like.A canister filter system typically includes a base which is often attached to the equipment, a canister (also sometimes called a housing, cup, can, or cover), and a filter element which is removably positioned inside the canister. After the filter element is positioned inside the canister, the canister is attached to the base with threads or other attachment means to form a sealed compartment around the filter element. The canister, base, and filter element cooperate to define fluid pathways through which fluid is directed through the filter element. The filter element contains filter media which traps and collects contaminants as the fluid passes through it. The trapped contaminants may include dirt, water, soot, ash, metallic particles, and other harmful debris.Eventually these contaminants clog the filter media and reduce its effectiveness. Or other conditions can develop over time which also reduce the effectiveness of the filter media in removing contaminants. When this occurs, the filter element should be replaced (or possibly cleaned, but this is impractical for most applications). But only the filter element needs to be replaced, while the canister, base, and other components are reused. The filter element is designed to be conveniently replaced and readily disposed. The filter element can be replaced on demand, i.e. when the filter becomes clogged and requires replacement, or periodically, according to the guidance of a periodic maintenance schedule established for the particular application.Canister filter systems can have many advantages over other filter systems such as spin-on filters. For instance, canister filter systems can be relatively inexpensively provided with a drain. To avoid spills, a technician may wish to remove the fluid from the canister in a controlled and contained manner before detaching the canister to replace the filter element. The drain facilitates the removal of fluid that is inside the canister. In some circumstances the fluid can spill if it is not first removed from the canister before detaching the canister from the base. The drain is typically integrated into the canister. Because in a canister filter system the drain generally increases just the cost of the canister, which is reused and purchased only once, and generally does not increase the cost of the filter element, which is frequently replaced and purchased many times, the additional cost of including a drain does not significantly increase the total operating cost to the equipment owner.U.S. Pat. No. 6,814,243, granted Nov. 9, 2004, (“the '243 patent”) is an example of prior art canister filter systems incorporating a drain in the canister. FIG. 1 of the '243 patent illustrates a canister  with an integrated drain (the drain is not labeled with a reference character, but is shown incorporated into the bottom of canister  in , and is shown in a closed position).The '243 patent is also an example of another, increasingly important feature of canister filter systems. The arrangement of the filter system described in the '243 patent makes it impossible to install the canister to the base, without first having a filter element properly installed in the canister. This prevents, for example, accidentally or intentionally running the machinery without the filter element in place. As components such as fuel pumps, fuel injectors, hydraulic pumps, valves, bearings, engines, etc., become more expensive, more high tech, and are made with tighter tolerances and specifications, it is increasingly important to protect these components against contamination. Contamination may cause premature wear and even failure, and the problem is compounded when the component has tight tolerances between parts or is very expensive. Thus, it may be very advantageous in some applications to ensure that a technician does not accidentally or intentionally try to run machinery without an appropriate filter element in place.However, while the filter system of the '243 patent performs well in some applications, it may suffer from several disadvantages, or is otherwise not well suited for other applications. For instance, the filter system of the '243 patent may not be well suited for applications where the fluid in the canister is at a high pressure. Because the connection of the canister to the base is through the filter element, the force of high pressure in the canister is reacted through the filter element, which may not be strong enough for the pressures of some applications. Additionally, O-ring between the canister and base is not intended to hold high pressure inside of the canister.The presence of threads in the filter element's center tube can be a disadvantage in some circumstances. The threads in the center tube, which are used to connect the filter element and canister to the base, are located in the clean fluid pathway out of the system. Threads in the clean fluid pathway may contribute to contamination.In addition, the canister of the system described in the '243 patent can be relatively complicated and expensive to manufacture for some applications. The connection structure incorporated into the bottom of the canister may add too much cost for some applications.Because of these drawbacks, another canister filter design is needed which still prevents accidentally or intentionally using the filter system without a filter element installed, but is also relieved of some or all of the disadvantages exhibited by the '243 patent.A canister filter system includes a base, a canister attachable to the base, and a filter element having filter media positioned inside the canister. A drain forms a seal with, and may releasably engage the filter element when the drain is in a closed position. In an open position, the drain allows fluid to be removed from the canister. Because the drain forms a seal with, and may releasably engage the filter element in the closed position, the drain cannot be closed unless a filter element is properly positioned inside the canister. This prevents accidental or intentional use of the filter system without a filter element in place.The following is a detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention. The exemplary embodiments described herein and illustrated in the drawing figures are intended to teach the principles of the invention, enabling those of ordinary skill in this art to make and use the invention in many different environments and for many different applications. The exemplary embodiments should not be considered as a limiting description of the scope of patent protection. The scope of patent protection shall be defined by the appended claims, and is intended to be broader than the specific embodiments described herein.illustrates a canister filter system  having a base , a canister , and a filter element . The general construction and use of a canister filter system is understood by those of ordinary skill in this art. Thus, all the details of the construction and use of canister filter system  need not be explained here. The canister filter system  may be used to filter fluids such as diesel or gasoline or other liquid fuels, lubrication oil, hydraulic fluid for hydraulic power systems, transmission fluid, or even possibly intake air for an engine. The canister filter system  may also be used as a fuel/water separator filter. The canister filter system  with the features described herein could be adapted by those of ordinary skill in this art to serve many different purposes and suit many other applications.The base  includes an inlet channel  for fluid inlet into the canister filter system , and an outlet channel  for fluid outlet from the canister filter system . The base also includes base threads .The canister  includes an open end  and a closed end . Adjacent the open end  are canister threads  which can be engaged with base threads  to hold the canister  to base . Threads are one example of engagement structures which may be included on the base  and canister  to form a releasable engagement. Other engagement structures may be used as will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in this art.The filter element  may take many different forms to suit a particular application. In the illustrated embodiment, the filter element  is well suited for filtering fuel or lubrication oil. The filter element  may include annularly arranged filter media  circumferentially surrounding a central reservoir defined by center tube . Axial ends of filter media  are sealed by end plates. Open end plate  defines an axial open end of filter element . The open end plate  is termed “open” because it includes an opening  for allowing passage of fluid to outlet channel  from the central reservoir defined by center tube . Closed end plate  defines an axial closed end of filter element . The closed end plate  is termed “closed” because it prevents any fluid outside the filter element  adjacent axial end of filter media  from flowing unfiltered into center tube . Open end plate  and closed end plate  may each be joined to the center tube  via welding, adhesives, etc. Alternatively, several or all of center tube , open end plate , and closed end plate  may be constructed as unitary components.Fluid to be filtered enters from the inlet channel  and flows to the annular cavity  between canister  and filter media . The fluid then passes into and through filter media , then into center tube  through the perforations shown therein in . The fluid exits center tube  through open end plate  and opening  into the outlet channel . The open end plate  and closed end plate  help define the fluid channels into and out of filter media , preventing any fluid from flowing directly to outlet channel  and bypassing filter media . First and second annular seals  and  may advantageously be included on filter element  and also help define and seal fluid passageways into and out of filter element . First annular seal  may be included on the open end plate  around opening  and adjacent the axial open end of filter element  to help seal the inlet channel  from the outlet channel . Second annular seal , larger in diameter than first annular seal , may be formed circumferentially around the open end plate  to provide the seal between canister  and base , or in other words provides a seal to prevent fluid in inlet channel  from leaking out of the joint between canister  and base . First and second annular seals ,  may be integrally formed with open end plate , or attached with adhesives or other methods, as is known in this art. When first and second annular seals ,  are integrally formed on or included on open end plate , proper replacement of these seals is assured when the filter element is replaced at proper intervals. Otherwise, a technician may fail to properly replace the seals at appropriate intervals, which could result in leakage out of the system, or leakage within the system allowing unfiltered fluid to bypass the filter element  and lead to contamination.With reference now to , a drain  penetrates the closed end  of canister . The drain  provides a drain channel  for removing fluid from inside of canister . The drain  is elongated and includes an inlet end  and an outlet end  connected to one another by the drain channel . Inlet end  is positioned inside of canister . Outlet end  is positioned outside of canister . The drain  may be moved between a closed position and an open position. In the closed position of , fluid is not able to flow through drain channel . In the open position of , fluid is able to flow from the inlet end , through drain channel , and out from outlet end . Drain  can be adapted to suit many different applications. The illustrated embodiment provides only one exemplary configuration for drain .Canister  includes a drain boss  on closed end . Drain boss  protrudes out and away from closed end , and may include surfaces thereon that would allow a tool, such as an adjustable, open-ended wrench, to engage the drain boss  and turn the canister . Drain boss  forms a bore . Drain  is positioned in, and is able to slide axially and rotate in bore . An O-ring groove  is formed around the exterior of drain  and an O-ring is positioned therein. Alternatively, the O-ring groove may be formed on the bore . The O-ring prevents fluid leakage out of canister  through bore  from between drain  and drain boss .Drain  may cooperate with filter element  to form a releasable engagement with filter element , and a releasable seal with filter element , when drain  is in its closed position. In the illustrated embodiment, drain  forms a releasable engagement with filter element  through engagement structure that includes a releasable threaded connection. Closed end plate  may form a pocket  in which are provided threads . Threads  are formed on an inside surface of the pocket . Mutual threads  may be formed near inlet end  of drain . Drain  may be engaged with filter element  by threading together threads  and . Threads are one example of engagement structures which may be included on the filter element  and drain  to form a releasable engagement. Other known engagement structures may be used for particular advantage in certain applications as will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in this art.When in its closed position, with drain  releasably engaged with filter element , a releasable seal is made with filter element  so that practically no fluid can enter inlet end  of drain . The releasable seal is made with seal structure which, in the illustrated embodiment, includes an inlet opening  extending between drain channel  and the radial exterior of inlet end , and pocket  which receives the inlet opening  when the drain  is sealed. Putting drain  in its closed position moves inlet opening  inside of pocket , blocking the inlet opening  so that practically no fluid can enter therein. Additionally, an O-ring groove  may be formed on drain  and an O-ring positioned therein. This O-ring may provide additional protection against fluid leaking from between drain  and pocket  and entering inlet opening . Instead of positioning the O-ring inside of pocket , the O-ring could also be positioned between drain  and another portion of closed end plate , and the O-ring could be positioned in a groove formed on closed end plate  instead of on drain . When moving drain  to its closed position, as it advances into pocket , fluid trapped therein may need an escape path. This path may be provided by allowing drain channel  to be open through axial inlet end  of drain .Pocket  includes an open end , a smooth section , a threaded section , and a closed end . Closed end ensures that no fluid may flow from center tube  into pocket  and inlet opening , and vice versa. Threads  are formed in the threaded section . Smooth section may act as a part of the sealing structure by fitting tightly against the surfaces of drain  to prevent fluid from entering between and flowing from open end to inlet opening . Smooth section may also provide a surface against which the O-ring in O-ring groove  may seal for additional protection against fluid passage. To help maintain the smoothness of the surface of smooth section , the diameter of this section may be larger than the major diameter of the threads , forming a lip between the smooth section and threaded section . The larger diameter of smooth section will help avoid the threads  on drain  from degrading the smooth surface used for sealing purposes.When in an opened position, drain  is at least partially disengaged from filter element , and inlet opening  is open so that fluid may flow into drain channel . In the illustrated embodiment with a threaded engagement, putting the drain  in an opened position requires turning drain  to disengage threads  and . As threads  and  disengage, inlet end  of drain  advances out of pocket , unblocking inlet opening . Together, these features ensure that no fluid may enter inlet end  of drain  except when inlet opening  has backed out of pocket , clearing the smooth section and the open end . Fluid is then free to flow from inside canister , through inlet opening , through drain channel , and exit through outlet end  of drain .Threads  and pocket  on filter element  need not necessarily be formed in closed end plate . The threads  and pocket  could also be formed as part of center tube , or some other part of filter element , as will be understood by those of ordinary skill in this art.Other features and constructions may be used to provide cooperation between drain  and filter element  so that fluid cannot flow through drain  when drain  is in the closed position, and fluid may flow through drain  when drain  is in the opened position. For example, filter element  and drain  could be constructed so that drain  makes a releasable seal with filter element  to close drain , but the two may not be releasably engaged. Instead, as an example, the filter element  and drain could be independently engaged with the canister , and moving drain  to a closed position would involve drain  moving upward to form a releasable seal with filter element , but not releasably engage it.The releasable engagement and the releasable seal between the drain  and the filter element  has several advantages. First, the engagement and/or seal ensure that a filter element  is placed inside canister  before the system can be used. A technician will not accidentally or intentionally assemble the system without a filter element  because without it, the drain  cannot be closed. Ensuring the presence of filter element  helps ensure that the fluid will be properly filtered.With no threaded connections in the pathway of clean fluid from the center tube  to the outlet channel , the possibility of contamination is reduced. Threaded connections in the clean, filtered fluid pathway have been identified as a potential source of contamination. When threads are cut or formed in other ways on a metal component, or even a plastic component, a small amount of debris is often left on the threads. When the threaded connection is made, the debris may be removed through the threading action, and is then free to enter the clean fluid pathway and result in contamination of downstream components. Thus, the avoidance of threads in the clean fluid pathway eliminates this potential source of contamination.The provision of threads on the filter element  provides a convenient means for repairing the threaded connection should the threads be crossed or damaged in some manner. If a threaded connection is between the canister  and drain  (as in prior art systems), either the canister  or the drain , or both, must be replaced if the threads are crossed or damaged in some other way. If threads  formed on filter element  are formed in plastic, while threads  on the drain  are formed in a harder material (possibly aluminum or another metal), when threads  and  are crossed, more than likely only threads  will be damaged. Threads  are easily replaceable by replacing the filter element . Finally, the engagement between the drain  and filter element  provides a means for securely holding the filter element inside the canister .Holding the filter element  inside of canister  may have some advantages during installation and replacement of the filter element . For example, the canister  can be turned upside down by a technician to drain residual fluid therefrom, without the filter element  falling out. Also, the filter element  can be held in the correct position inside of canister  so that when the canister  is attached to the base , the filter element  will properly align with features on the base .Other advantages may also be realized in some applications. In some applications, the manufacturing of canister  may be simplified because no structure for engaging the drain (e.g. threads) is needed on the canister.Drain knob  facilitates turning drain  for moving between its closed and open positions. Drain knob  may be optionally positioned about drain  on the exterior of canister . Drain knob  includes splines  that mate with splines  formed on the exterior of drain . The splines ,  allow drain knob  to move axially relative to drain  (along an axis parallel to the rotational axis of drain ), but tie the two together rotationally. Turning drain knob  will cause a corresponding rotation of drain .In addition, drain knob  includes camming surfaces  that engage with mutual camming surfaces  on drain boss . A spring  acts between the drain  and the drain knob , biasing the camming surfaces  towards engagement with the camming surfaces . When camming surfaces  and  engage one another, they permit the drain knob  to rotate relative the canister  in only a single direction. Camming surfaces  and  may be formed to permit rotation of drain knob  and drain  in the direction of its closed position (clockwise in the illustrated embodiment), but prohibit drain  to rotate in the opposite direction towards its open position unless camming surfaces  and  are disengaged. They may be disengaged by pulling drain knob  against the bias of spring , and separating the two camming surfaces , . The camming surfaces ,  permit relative rotation in one direction by providing cams whereby the cams may slide by one another in one direction. The camming surfaces ,  prohibit relative rotation in the other direction by providing positive stopping surfaces which interfere or clash.A spring  may optionally act between drain  and canister . Spring  biases the drain  into the canister . This may provide advantages in inserting and removing the filter element . For instance, in cooperation with the drain knob , biasing the drain  upwards causes the camming surfaces ,  to engage and temporarily block rotation of the drain  in one direction. With spring  positioned as shown in the figures, and with camming surfaces  and , a technician can install a replacement filter element  in a simple manner by holding the canister  with one hand, and turning the filter element  with the other hand to engage the filter element  with the drain .The canister filter system  may be assembled by first positioning the filter element  inside the canister . The canister  includes an open end  through which the filter element  may pass, and a closed end . Next the drain  is caused to engage the filter element . The drain  passes through the bore  in the canister , with the inlet end  projecting into the canister to engage with the filter element . Preferably, the filter element  and drain  are first fully engaged, which simultaneously moves the drain to a closed position, before the canister  is finally engaged with the base  to complete the assembly.With first and second annular seals  and  (see ) integrally formed with or attached to filter element , many of the surfaces and seals which provide a sealing function in the system  will be replaced when the filter element  is replaced. This helps ensure the system  will function properly throughout its life.The canister filter system  may be used to filter contaminants from fluid systems including fuel systems, lubrication oil systems, hydraulic fluid power systems, hydraulic fluid control systems, transmission fluid systems, engine air intake systems, and the like, while permitting fluid to be conveniently drained using drain . Because of the arrangement of drain  with filter element , a technician is prevented from accidentally or intentionally operating system  unless a filter element  is in place. This operability limitation helps protect components which are sensitive to contamination."

                "This application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 13/026,576, filed Feb. 14, 2011, now pending; which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/373,114, filed Mar. 13, 2006, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,905,071, issued Mar. 15, 2011; which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/410,271, filed Apr. 10, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,040,063, issued May 9, 2006; which is a continuation of International Application No. PCT/FR00/02818, filed Oct. 10, 2000, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.1. Field of the InventionThe invention relates to the field of window glass, particularly for motor vehicles, and is aimed more specifically at window glasses equipped with decorative and/or functional elements attached to the glass. More particularly, the invention relates to a window glass, particularly for installation in an opening in vehicle bodywork, comprising a sheet of glass with a profiled bead that is fixed at least to the main surface of the sheet of glass facing toward the interior in the installed state. This bead may, by way of covering appendage, comprise a lip projecting beyond the edge of the window glass with a sealing rib which can be applied against an adjacent wall part when the window glass is being installed.2. Discussion of the BackgroundIt is a generally known practice for vehicle window glass to be bonded into the respective openings in the vehicle bodywork. To this end, window glasses are often provided with a profiled bead that adheres at least to the main surface of the glass facing toward the interior, in the installed state. A run of adhesive is applied to the profiled bead and/or near to the profiled bead on this same main surface of the glass. The window glass provided with the run of adhesive is then inserted into the opening in the vehicle bodywork. The latter is surrounded by a mounting flange, to which the run of adhesive is applied. Window glasses in the installed state preferably lie practically flush with the external surface of the bodywork. For such installation, the mounting flange is recessed with respect to the main surface of the bodywork by means of a peripheral angled step. The height of the angled step corresponds to the thickness of the window glass and of the adhesive. In certain embodiments, the edge faces of the window glass are not covered by the profiled bead. As the dimensions of the window glass and the periphery of the opening cannot be matched to one another without tolerance, due to of dimensional variations in manufacture, a space remains, in the form of a groove, between the angled step or the edge of the opening and the window glass.According to document DE-A1-38 18 930, there is provided, for covering this space, a lip formed directly on the profiled bead bonded to the window, for example by extrusion. In another alternative embodiment from the same document, an additional profiled strip made of a flexible elastomeric plastic is bonded along the peripheral surface of the window on the main surface that faces toward the interior. This profiled strip has a tubular portion, which fills said space when the window glass is in the mounted state.A shape of profile is also known (from DE-A1-43 01 026), which on three sides surrounds the external edge and the edge face of the window in one embodiment, that is to say also on the external main surface, and which further comprises a lip projecting from the window glass and serving to cover the lateral slot.Thermoplastics, preferably thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) or thermoplastic olefins (TPO) have mainly been used hitherto as materials for such profiles. With these materials, the lip can be manufactured so that it is already thin enough at the extrusion stage, so that it can be flexed elastically against the edge of the opening when the window glass is installed in the bodywork without generating excessively high reactive forces during the mounting. In addition to its sealing function, the lip centers the window glass in the opening during insertion and keeps the window glass centered.Dirt can still build up in the space thus covered by the folded-over lip disclosed in the prior art, and can be removed from the bottom of the groove only with difficulty. The space that remains in general actually is greater than 7 millimeters and thus allows a great deal of dirt to accumulate.The present invention relates to a new type of mounting for a window glass comprising a profiled bead that avoids the aforementioned drawbacks and does not require a finishing strip to cover part of the window glass.The invention relates to a window glass that is designed in particular to be installed by adhesive bonding in an opening of a motor vehicle bodywork, comprising a sheet of glass with a profiled bead that is fixed at least to the main surface of the sheet of glass facing toward the interior in the installed state and that rests against at least half of the opening. After installation, the visible space between the opening and the edge face of the window glass is less than 5 millimeters and preferably less than 3 millimeters.The “edge face of the window glass” is to be understood as meaning either the edge face of the window itself or, if the profiled bead covers it, the corresponding portion of the bead. The profiled bead according to the invention may be a continuous or discontinuous element and may be a single or multiple element, that is to say may consist of at least two practically parallel parts deposited at the periphery of the sheet of glass.The invention thus makes it possible to obtain closure flush with the main surface of the window and with the adjacent wall or bodywork surface. In addition to the technical advantages afforded, this then visually yields a practically closed surface. The technical advantages are essentially the fact that the visible space between the bodywork opening and the window glass is reduced and that the risk of said region becoming soiled is avoided.The invention results from a choice by the inventors not to follow the typical design precautions; instead, the inventors chose to reduce the space between the window glass and the opening by demonstrating, contrary to that which might be expected by a person skilled in the art, that the technique according to the invention was acceptable and did not run the risk of damaging the window glass.According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the profile is designed to limit the expansion of a bead of adhesive, and in particular the lateral expansion thereof. The shape of the profiled bead thus advantageously is designed to prevent the adhesive used to fix the window glass into the bodywork opening from excessively spreading and disrupting the field of view of the window glass. This shape also advantageously makes it possible to define the spacing between the window glass and the bottom of the bodywork opening and therefore allow predetermined positioning in at least one direction. The shape of the bead thus defined also makes it possible to predetermine the amount of adhesive needed to fix the window glass and thus permit the window glass to be firmly secured while making it easier for operations to be automated.According to a first embodiment of the invention, a bead of adhesive at least partially covers the profiled bead. In particular, depending on the nature of the profiled bead and on the nature of the bead of adhesive, the securing of the window glass is reinforced by the binding of said two beads. The bead of adhesive may be wholly deposited on the profiled bead and their binding thus may be directly associated with the securing of the window glass. Advantageously, in order to bind the two beads, the forces of bonding and the forces of mechanical attachment may be combined. To this end, the profiled bead preferably is provided with anchoring projections. These projections accommodate the bead of adhesive which, after curing, is mechanically held. Advantageously, the invention also relates to an alternate embodiment in which no adhesion occurs between the two beads; such an embodiment may facilitate removal of the window glass, if necessary. Indeed, if the mechanical binding between the two beads is of the nesting type, the window glass may be readily removed.In other cases, where the bead of adhesive at least partially covers the profiled bead and, in particular, when the sheet of glass comprises at least two sides which have curvatures with small radii of curvature, the profiled bead is produced with a slope such that its surface is inclined downward from its edge oriented toward the center of the window glass toward its other edge positioned at the edge of the sheet of glass. Such an embodiment applies more particularly to windshields or back lights, the lateral approach angles of which are small. In this embodiment, the bead of adhesive subsequently may be deposited by robot with ease; the slope of the profiled bead with respect to the plane of the window glass in this region allows the plane of depositing of the bead of adhesive to be straightened up in the direction of the horizontal when the window glass is resting on its center of the convex side.According to another alternate embodiment of the invention, the bead of adhesive does not in any way cover the profiled bead. The only contact between the two beads is possibly related to the fact that the profiled bead may be designed to limit the lateral expansion of the bead of adhesive.According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the profiled bead has, over at least part of its length, a lip that projects beyond the edge of the window glass. Such a lip advantageously is made to be deformable or flexible. These features give the lip mechanical properties that allow said lip to perform various functions. First, when the lip is over all or part of at least two sides of the window glass, it will act as a centering tool for positioning the window glass correctly in the bodywork opening. Also, for example, when a lip is provided on the upper part of the window glass along all or part of the length of the profile and when the bottom of the window glass rests on stops, said lip may supply a reactive force against the bodywork opening facing it, thus providing a defined space between the bodywork opening and the window glass. Furthermore, the lip avoids any risk of contact between the sheet of glass and the bodywork and therefore any risk of damaging the sheet of glass.The lip thus produced also may have a sealing function between the opening and the window glass; the lip will bend in one direction or the other, as chosen, and will press against the opening. The pressure thus exerted is enough to provide a good seal. For this function, the lip advantageously is provided along at least three sides of the window glass; it is not actually essential for the lip to be present on the bottom part of the window glass when the latter is installed.According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, provision is made for a solid wire to be incorporated into the bead of adhesive or into the profiled bead. The purpose of such a wire is to make it easier to remove the window glass, if necessary, and in particular, to allow materials to be recycled.Such a bead is inserted for example into or under the bead of adhesive when the latter is produced, taking care to let at least one end of the wire protrude. It thus may be possible when the window glass is in place to grasp hold of this end, possibly using a tool, and then, by pulling on the wire possibly also using a tool, to break the bead of adhesive.Such a device making it possible to break the bead of adhesive or the profiled bead is practically essential in the context of the invention if the window glass is to be removed. The space visible between the window glass and the bodywork opening, which space is smaller than 5 millimeters, does not permit access by a cutting tool and, in any case, would not allow such a tool to be operated. Indeed, only the case mentioned previously whereby the binding between the window glass and the bodywork is of purely mechanical nature when the profiled bead has anchoring projections permits the window glass to be removed without providing a device such as a cutting wire. However, the present invention also contemplates the combination of such a wire with this mounting exhibiting only mechanical retaining means; in such a case, the wire is no longer truly a cutting wire but provides assistance with disengaging the bead of adhesive and the profiled bead.According to another advantageous embodiment of the invention, at least two wires are incorporated into the bead of adhesive or the profiled bead. The wires are preferably positioned some distance from one another so that each wire need only slit through part of the bead of adhesive. The forces needed for this operation are therefore reduced.Means in particular for fitting such wires are, for example, described in patent applications EP-A-0 121 480 and EP-A-0 298 788.Still according to this same principle of incorporating an element into the bead of adhesive or into the profiled bead, or alternatively at least incorporating an element between the profiled bead and the bead of adhesive, the invention advantageously relates to fitting a sheath into which another element can then be inserted. This may then be a cutting wire or alternatively another type of element having a different function.In one advantageous embodiment of the invention, a profiled bead is made of a two-part material. For example, the profiled bead may be formed of a polyurethane. The choice of such a material has the advantage of providing excellent compatibility with the intended adhesive, it easily being possible for this adhesive to be chosen from a similar kind.In another embodiment of the invention, the profiled bead is produced from a thermoplastic. Such material in particular has the advantage of being easy to recycle, which is often a requirement. As regards the compatibility of a thermoplastic with the adhesive, such compatibility is not always easy to obtain. When necessary, particularly when the bead of adhesive at least partially covers a profiled bead made of a thermoplastic, the surface of the latter advantageously may be coated beforehand with an adhesion primer.In both instances, the means of producing the profiled bead are varied.According one embodiment, the invention advantageously provides a profiled bead directly obtained by extrusion onto the surface of the sheet of glass. Advantageously in the case of a profile made of a thermoplastic, the extrusion device and, in particular, the extrusion head and piping may be heated.Alternatively, the profiled bead and the bead of adhesive may be co-extruded directly onto the sheet of glass. The bead of adhesive may remain plastically deformable and adhesive until the window glass is fitted into the bodywork opening.According to another embodiment of the invention, the profiled bead is manufactured beforehand, for example by extrusion, and later fixed to the sheet of glass, for example by adhesive bonding. Such a profile, for example, is made by extrusion in a long length and then cut to the required length for a given window glass and fixed thereto. To fix the profiled bead, it is possible to adhesively bond it, for example by providing a perforated profile with the adhesive being able to pass through the holes, come into contact with the sheet of glass, and thus secure the profile firmly.According to another embodiment of the invention, the profile is obtained using an encapsulation technique.According to any of these techniques of obtaining the profiled bead, said profiled bead is produced on the internal face of the window glass, when the latter is fixed into the bodywork opening. However, the profiled bead may still cover part of the edge face of the glass window and/or cover part of the external face of the window glass.The profiled bead and/or the bead of adhesive may be in direct contact with the glass or in contact with an opaque layer, such as an enameled coating, itself deposited onto the glass.As regards the window glass, this consists of at least one sheet of glass and may therefore consist of a laminated window glass.The invention also provides a window glass consisting in particular of a sheet of glass comprising a profiled bead and in particular intended to be fixed by adhesive bonding into a bodywork opening and which, in particular, can allow use as described previously and for example be fixed in such a way that the space visible after mounting between the window glass and the bodywork opening is less than 5 millimeters.Other advantageous details and features of the invention will be become apparent hereinafter from the exemplary embodiments of the invention with reference to .depicts a window glass consisting of a sheet of glass  provided with a profiled bead  adhering near its edge to one of its main surfaces, which will be the interior surface once the window glass has been installed in a bodywork opening.The profiled bead  can be deposited directly onto the surface of the sheet of glass  or, as illustrated here, onto a coating , such as an enameled layer deposited by screen printing. The profiled bead  is deposited preferably by extrusion or by some other method such as overmolding or encapsulation, adhesive bonding of a prefabricated bead, etc. It is made of a thermoplastic, preferably an elastomer or a blend of thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) or thermoplastic olefin(s) (TPO(s)). It may also be a two-part material such as a polyurethane.The sheet of glass  may consist of glass or a transparent plastic and may be produced monolithically or, unlike the illustration, with a laminated structure combining at least two sheets of glass and/or transparent plastic.Profiled bead  essentially comprises a base profile resting on a main surface of the sheet of glass. This profile projects practically at right angles from the surface of the sheet of glass  and, at its free end, forms a bearing rib . The latter, in the installed position, is disposed against a mounting flange of a bodywork opening and will, upon mounting, define the position of the window glass in the bodywork opening in terms of the depth to which it is set in said opening.In the embodiment depicted, profiled bead  adheres only to the main surface of the sheet of glass  intended to face toward the interior. As an alternative, profiled bead  may cover two or three faces of the sheet of glass, namely a main surface and at least part of the edge face of said sheet of glass or, respectively, the two main surfaces and the edge face of the sheet of glass, straddling the edge of the latter., , and each illustrate another type of window glass consisting, as before, of a sheet of glass  but, as already stated, could be a sheet of plastic or a laminated window glass. A profiled bead  produced according to one of the previously mentioned methods and materials is fixed to the sheet of glass  or, more precisely, to an opaque layer , itself deposited on at the periphery of the sheet of glass ., , and also each depict a bead of adhesive  deposited on profile . This bead of adhesive , in some embodiments, may be deposited directly on the sheet of glass  or the opaque layer , or alternatively may partially cover profiled bead . The bead of adhesive  is deposited between two bearing ribs  which will limit the expansion of the adhesive on each side, and define the distance separating the bottom of the bodywork opening from the window glass.The profiled bead  additionally comprises a lip  projecting beyond the edge of the window glass.The lip , formed of one piece, projects from base profile  at a certain angle with respect to the main extension of the latter, possibly practically parallel to the main surface of the sheet of glass, more or less mid-way between the sheet of glass  and the bearing ribs , and extends beyond the periphery of the sheet of glass .In this configuration, lip  may have different functions. Lip  advantageously forms an elastically deformable part of profiled bead . The lip  can thus be deformed upon installation in the bodywork opening and act as a centering element. Of course, lip  also has a function of protecting the sheet of glass  because it prevents any aggressive contact between said sheet of glass and the metal parts of the bodywork opening. Furthermore, lip  also may have a sealing function because it is applied under great pressure against the bodywork opening; its deformation, at the very least, may make it possible to form channels for discharging rain or washing water. The functions of this lip will be further discussed in connection with the description of .Referring again to , a cutting wire is shown to be incorporated into profile . Such a wire could even be fitted in the bead of adhesive , or between the two beads. At least one end of wire is left free so that, after mounting, it can be grasped by an operator, possibly using a tool. A tensile force may permit either the bead of adhesive  or the profiled bead , as in the case of , to be cut. In , component represents two wires incorporated into a sheath, which is in turn, incorporated into the profile bead . In , component represents one wire incorporated into a sheath, which in turn, is incorporated into the bead of adhesive .schematically illustrates an embodiment according to the invention for mounting of a window glass  comprising a profiled bead  in a bodywork opening , using a bead of adhesive . Also shown in addition to a window glass  and a profiled bead  is the edge of an opening  in bodywork which is not further illustrated. Window glass  is connected by adhesion to the bodywork upright  by means of a bead of adhesive  applied to the profiled bead . Lips  also are shown extending profiled bead  so as to project beyond the edge of the window glass  in their deformed state.  also clearly shows the various functions of said lip, particularly the centering, sealing and water run-off functions.In the mounted state, the external main surface of window glass  is practically flush with the external surface of the bodywork. Furthermore, according to the invention, the space  visible between the bodywork opening and the window glass has a size less than 5 millimeters.By comparison with the earlier configurations for the mounting of such window glasses the present invention provides a space between the window glass and the bodywork opening making it possible to avoid the build-up of dirt. Furthermore, it has been found that a reduction in said space also makes it possible to reduce aerodynamic noise. Another advantage of the present invention is that it affords a very particular visual and attractive appearance, because, to an observer standing a relatively short distance away from a vehicle with this set-up, the window glass appears to be an uninterrupted continuation of the bodywork.The detailed description which has just been given relates more particularly to a window glass equipped by extrusion with a profiled bead which adheres to a main surface.The same teachings apply to profiles obtained by other techniques (encapsulation or adhesive bonding) and/or covering more than one face of the window."

                "This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/914,551 filed on Aug. 9, 2004, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/493,247, filed Aug. 7, 2003 and entitled “Modified Orthopaedic Implants for Improved Sterilization.” The disclosure of each application is incorporated by reference in its entirety.Not Applicable.Not Applicable.1. Field of the InventionEmbodiments of the present invention relate to pre-assembled orthopaedic implants adapted for gas sterilization.2. Related ArtOrthopaedic implants, such as knee, hip or shoulder prostheses, occasionally include components that are shipped to the surgeon or other user in a pre-assembled condition. For example, a hip prosthesis may include a bipolar component that includes a metal acetabular shell pre-assembled with a plastic liner. To lessen the chances of post-implantation failure, the shell and liner must fit together snugly, with a relatively tight interface between the two components.Pre-assembled components, as well as other orthopaedic implant components, may be sterilized prior to use to minimize the chances of infection. Orthopaedic components may be sterilized using a number of different techniques, including gas sterilization and gamma radiation.In some circumstances, gas sterilization is a preferred technique for sterilizing orthopaedic components. Gas sterilization utilizes a gas such as ethylene oxide (ETO) or vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) to incapacitate bacterial or other disease causing agents. However, gas sterilization May be ineffective in certain circumstances. For example, if during sterilization the gas is unable to contact all surfaces of the orthopaedic components, it may not effectively sterilize those components.Typical pre-assembled orthopaedic components may not be suitable for gas sterilization. Because of the relatively tight interface between the components, the gas may not be able to penetrate between the components to sterilize all of the surfaces. Additionally, even if some of the gas penetrates between the pre-assembled components, the gas may not necessarily be able to effectively dissipate from in between the tightly fitted pre-assembled components after sterilization is complete. Trace amounts of gas may remain in the implant, potentially having deleterious effects on the health of the individual who receives the implant.Because typical pre-assembled orthopaedic implants may not be suitable for gas sterilization, they have in the past been sterilized using the less preferable gamma irradiation technique. Gamma irradiation may cause oxidation of plastics, such as the polyethylene commonly used for the plastic liner of a pre-assembled orthopaedic component. Oxidation of the polyethylene forming the plastic liner may weaken the component, increasing the chance that the implant will fail. Gamma irradiation may also be undesirable because it may neutralize the effects of cross-linking in highly cross-linked plastic components, also potentially weakening the component.Various embodiments of the present invention include a pre-assembled orthopaedic implant suitable for gas sterilization. In some embodiments, one or more gas conduits associated with one or more of the orthopaedic components facilitates the penetration and/or dispersion of a sterilizing gas into and from the pre-assembled components, but do not affect the mechanical integrity or overall performance of the implant. Embodiments of the present invention may include pre-assembled knee, hip, shoulder or other orthopaedic components.In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the gas conduit or conduits may be formed in several suitable shapes, sizes, locations, orientations or configurations. For example, in some embodiments the gas conduits are a plurality of channels inscribed onto a mating surface of one or more of the orthopaedic components. In other embodiments, the gas conduits are one or more apertures passing through one or more of the orthopaedic components. Other embodiments may include any combination of the foregoing gas conduits, or other structures serving as suitable gas conduits.Further features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the present invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.Referring to the accompanying drawings in which like reference numbers indicate like elements,  shows an orthopaedic implant  according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The implant  shown in  is adapted for implantation into the acetabulum of a hip such that the implant  can receive a prosthetic femoral head in a rotating fashion (however, embodiments of the present invention also include implants that can interact with natural portions of the anatomy—such as natural femoral heads).  shows (in a disassembled state) implant  associated with a femoral head  and stem .As shown in , orthopaedic implants  in accordance with embodiments of the present invention may include at least two orthopaedic components  and .  shows the implant including two components: an acetabular shell  and a liner . In the embodiment shown in , acetabular shell  is metal and liner  is a plastic, such as ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. However, shell  and liner  may be formed from any desirable material.Implant  be assembled by press fitting liner  into an interior cavity of acetabular shell  such that a mating surface  on the liner  is in close proximity with a mating surface  of the acetabular shell , defining a mating surface interface . Liner  may be secured in shell  in any desirable, conventional, or non-conventional manner.Implant  may be shipped with the liner  assembled in the shell  and may be sterilized after assembly. If necessary or desired, the pre-assembled implant  may be later combined with other components to finalize assembly of the implant prior to implantation. A retaining ring  may secure the additional component to the pre-assembled implant.Pre-assembled implant  may include one or more gas conduits . Gas conduits , as discussed above, may permit sterilization gasses such as ETO or VHP to penetrate into the mating surface interface , between the mating surfaces  and  of the shell  and liner . Gas conduits  may also facilitate dispersion of the sterilization gas from in-between the mating surfaces  and  of the components after sterilization is complete. Gas conduits  may be formed as one or more channels, one or more apertures, any combination of channels and apertures, or any other desired structure. The gas conduits  may be formed by machining, molding or any other conventional or non-conventional technique.shows an aperture gas conduit  extending from an inner surface to the outer, mating surface  of the liner.  shows a plurality of channel gas conduits  engraved in the mating surface  of the liner. In some embodiments, the liner may include both channels and apertures as gas conduits.In still other embodiments, such as the embodiment shown in , the acetabular shell  may also include gas conduits , such as apertures and channels. Gas conduits  associated with the acetabular shell  may facilitate the penetration and subsequent dispersion of sterilizing gas in a similar manner to gas conduits  associated with the liner .Gas conduits  may be associated with the shell , liner , or both, in any desired number, position or orientation to maximize the facilitation of penetration and dispersion of sterilizing gas between the mating surfaces  and  of the acetabular shell  and liner . For example, in the embodiment shown in , the acetabular liner  includes three channels forming arcs on the surface of the liner  and one aperture at an apex of the liner . Alternatively, as the embodiment in  shows, there are multiple apertures extending through the acetabular liner . In the alternate embodiment shown in , multiple channels and multiple apertures are associated with the acetabular shell .As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the particular embodiment of this invention described above and illustrated in the figures is provided for explaining the invention, and various alterations may be made in the structure and materials of the illustrated embodiment without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as described above. For example, orthopaedic implants in accordance with the present invention are not limited to acetabular shells and liners. Pre-assembled implants for use with knees, shoulders or other joints of the anatomy may also include gas conduits for improved sterilization in accordance with the embodiments of the present invention."

                "This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61/361,392 filed Jul. 3, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference.Existing object connectors are usually designed specifically for one type of objects. Often the connectors and the specific objects for which the connectors are designed for are sold or marketed together as a closed kit or building system. This approach has two disadvantages. First, to a new user, all of the pieces in the system are foreign, so the user must learn how each piece of the system works. Second, a user is limited to the specific pieces the user has purchased. Most likely, the object connectors the user has purchased cannot be used on objects with a slightly different shape.Fasteners may be used to hold objects together. However, fasteners have disadvantages as well. Some fasteners, such as screws and nails, destructively modify the objects they are designed to hold. Other fasteners, such as clamps, are too bulky and expensive to be used as object connectors in a construction project where many objects are needed to be assembled together.The invention relates to a device used to connect objects and methods for making and using the device. The device may be used in many applications including, but not limited to, artistic structures, construction toys, storage, and organization.In some embodiments, an object connector is disclosed as comprising at least one arm that includes a channel for engaging an object and at least one slot for interconnecting a second object connector. The slot of the object connector has undulating sides with at least one protrusion and is designed to receive a second object connector through the slot of the second object connector. The undulating sides of the slots of the object connector are designed to be in contact with the other object connector when both object connectors are connected.In some embodiments, an object connector assembly is also disclosed to include a first object connector that has at least one arm with a channel for gripping an object and at least one slot, and a second object connector having at least one arm with a channel for gripping an object and at least one slot. To form an object connector assembly, the second object connector is inserted into the at least one slot of the first object connector through the at least one slot of the second object connector.An example method of building an object assembly using object connectors is also disclosed. The object connectors have two or more arms with a channel in each arm for gripping an object and at least one slot for inter-connecting with another object connector. The method includes the following steps in building an assembly of objects. First, a first object is inserted into the channel of a first arm of a first object connector. Second, a second object connector is then attached to the assembly by inserting the first object into the channel of a first arm of the second object connector. Third, the assembly can be extended by engaging a third object connector into the slot of the first object connector through the slot of the third object connector.In the attached drawings, like reference numerals designate corresponding similar parts. The features of the illustrated embodiments can generally be combined unless they clearly exclude each other. Example embodiments are depicted in the drawings and are detailed in the description that follows.The present application discloses a non-destructive object connector that is versatile and can be used to connect both commonly found objects and objects of rare shapes. In addition, the object connector disclosed herein is inexpensive, compact, easy to store, and can be assembled with other object connectors to build different types of desired structures.As shown in the embodiments depicted in , an object connector includes one or more arms, each arm having a channel for holding an object.  is an embodiment of an object connector  with three arms . The object connector  may have one or more arms . For example, the object connector  may have three arms as illustrated in ; four arms as illustrated in , , and ; or five arms as illustrated in . While the arms  of the object connectors , ′ and ″ in  are illustrated as being equally spaced within about 180°, other example embodiments of the object connector  may have the arms spread out over a range that is greater than 180°, as illustrated in , or over a range that is less than 180°. In addition, the arms  may be unevenly spaced so that some adjoining arms are closer to each other than other adjoining arms. Furthermore, the arms  of an object connector  may be of different lengths and different shapes and thicknesses.As shown in , each arm  has a channel  for gripping objects. As illustrated in , the channel  has an undulating profile. The protrusions that alternate along the length of the channel  create a pinching effect to grip an object placed in the channel . The channel width is sized so that an object placed in the channel  will experience frictional forces. The stronger the frictional force, the more tightly the object will be held in the channel . The width of the channel  may be selected so that it does not exceed the amplitude of the undulating profile of the object plus the thickness of the object intended to be held by the channel . This constraint may be applied to the entire length of channel  or to one or more sections along the length of channel . The channel  may have a constant width along its length. Alternatively, the channel  may have varying width along its length. For example, the width of the channel  may include a taper along a portion of its length.In , each arm  of the example embodiment of the object connector  has two ends  that taper into the channel . The tapered design of the ends  guides the edge of the object to be held into the channel , making the process of attaching the object to the object connector  easier. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many geometries are possible for the arm . For example, as illustrated in the figures throughout, the arm  may become wider near the center of the object connector . This triangular profile for the arm  reduces the amount of material needed to achieve a certain level of durability.The object connector  in  includes a slot  for assembling multiple object connectors  together. In some embodiments, the slot  includes a pinching region formed between a first protrusion  on a first inner side of slot  and a second protrusion ′ on a second inner side of slot , where the first protrusion  may be positioned approximately opposite to the second protrusion ′. The width W of slot  can be designed to depend upon the thickness T of the object connector  and may be designed to be approximately the same as the thickness T of the object connector . The profiles of protrusions  and ′ may include, but are not limited to, a single portion of a circle, multiple portions of a circle, or undulating teeth or ridges. The positions of the protrusions , ′ on the inner sides of slot  can be varied to allow two object connectors to be assembled differently. In the embodiments illustrated in , the protrusions , ′ may be positioned such that when two object connectors A, B are assembled together, the planes through the channels A, B are not offset (zero planar offset). Alternatively, the protrusions , ′ may be positioned such that when two object connectors A, B are assembled together, the planes through the channels A and B have a nonzero offset, i.e., the channels A and B are not in the same plane. In addition, the protrusions may be positioned such that when two object connectors, A and B, are assembled together, the peaks of the protrusions , ′ on the first object connector A are positioned past the peaks of the protrusions , ′ of object connector B, and vice versa. Yet in another embodiment as illustrated in , the protrusions of the object connector A are configured to allow the first object connector to snap over the edge of the object connector B.In some embodiments, an object connector  may include magnets in the sides of the slot  such that when two object connectors are assembled together, the magnetic forces hold the object connectors together. Alternatively, in the embodiment illustrated in , the object connector ″″ may have no slot .In the embodiments shown in , the slots  in object connectors  allow two planar object connectors A, B to be assembled into a combined object connector .  shows two object connectors A, B in position before being assembled together.  shows the two object connectors A, B partially assembled together.  shows the two object connectors A, B completely assembled together, forming a combined object connector . The combined object connector  enables a user to hold objects in more orientations, thus increasing the number of ways in which objects may be positioned with respect to each other and increasing the number of objects that can be held in one location. Object connectors A, B may be designed so that the opposing channels A and B on the two connected object connectors A, B meet on approximately the same plane so that an object may be inserted into opposing channels A and B to gain additional support for the overall structure.illustrates another example of a combined object connector . In , the combined object connector  is formed by inserting an object connector B into the slot of an object connector A. The object connector A clips onto the object connector B in between two arms. However, the two object connectors A and B are connected not through the slot of the object connector B, unlike the two object connectors shown in .The object connector  may hold any object with an edge that can be gripped by the channel  of an arm . For example, the object connector  may be used to build structures out of planar objects, such as paper products, cardboard, playing cards, acrylic sheets, plastic sheets, cardstock, and photographic paper. The object connector  may also be used to build structures out of non-planar objects with an edge or area that can be inserted into the channel , for example, paper plates, balloons, or folded planar objects such as origami.The design of the object connector  may depend on the size and weight of the object to be held. The object connector  may be sized differently for different objects. Alternatively, the object connector  may be designed as a universal object connector that can hold different common household objects. In addition, the desired durability and aesthetics of the object connector  may affect its design. For example, the object connector  may be designed for use with common household items. Such object connector  may be sized to be suitable for use with paper or paper-like products between about 1/25th of an inch and 1/200th of an inch. Many business cards, index cards, playing cards, greeting cards, and plastic sheets fall within this category of products. In referring to , an example embodiment of such an object connector  may have a thickness T between about 1/32 of an inch and about ¼ of an inch, depending on the material used, the desired gripping power, and the desired durability of the object connector.The width of the channel  affects the gripping power of the object connector  and can be designed based on the desired gripping power. The width of the channel  may also be affected by manufacturing constraints. Preferably, the width of the channel  may be designed to be smaller than the amplitude of the undulating profile of the object plus the thickness of the object intended to be held. For example, the width of the channel  produced by a laser cutter in acrylic may be approximately 1/100 of an inch.The length of the channel  also affects the gripping power. A longer channel provides more gripping power than a shorter channel. For example, a length of 0.4 inches may be used for the channel . In referring to , the slot  may have a width W of approximately the thickness T of the object connector  with a margin of 0.1 inch. The overall length L of the object connector  depends on the length of the channel  and the width of the slot , and other factors such as aesthetic considerations. The overall length L may be between, for example, approximately 1.2 inches and 1.5 inches. It will be apparent to those of skill in the art that the dimensions or measurements provided herein are for illustrative purposes only. Other design specifications may be chosen without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The object connector  may be used to form many different types of structures. For example, as illustrated in , an object connector  may be used to hold a first object  and a second object  at a right angle to each other. Repeated use of this pattern forms a rectangular structure of the objects.As illustrated in , two object connectors A, B may be assembled to form a combined object connector  using the process shown in . The first object connector A may be used to hold a first object  and a second object  in a first orientation. The second object connector B may be used to hold a third object  in a second orientation orthogonal to the first orientation.As illustrated in , more than one object connector  may be used to hold objects together. For example, the object connectors A and B may be used to hold two objects in an arc. The unused arms  of the object connectors A and B are pointed towards the inside of the arc. However, the unused arm  may also be pointed towards the outside of the arc, as shown by object connector C.As illustrated in , every arm  of object connector  may be used, depending on the requirements of the desired structure to be built.show an example structure, a castle, built out of object connectors and playing cards.  shows a front view of the castle and  shows a top view of the castle. Although many of the examples show the object connector being used with playing cards, one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the object connector may be used with other objects as well.The object connector  may hold more than one object in the channel . For example, an example object connector  designed to hold playing cards may have a channel  that can hold, one, two, three, or four playing cards. Thus, the channel  may be used to hold two ends of a single playing card, or the ends of multiple playing cards. The object connector  may be made from many types of materials, depending on the object the object connector  is designed to hold. Possible materials include, but are not limited to, metal, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), acrylic, polypropylene, polyoxymethylene (e.g., Delrin®), card-stock, and any form of polyethylene, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride, polyether ether ketone, and nylon.The object connector  may also be made from more than one material. For example, the protrusions of slot  or the inner surfaces of channel  may be made from or coated with a material different from the material used for the rest of the object connector  to improve the gripping capability of slot  and channel .The object connector  may be manufactured by creating an extruded profile of the connector and then slicing the extruded profile into the desired connector thickness. The object connector  may also be manufactured by laser cutting the object connector  profile into sheets of material, such as plastics or a vegetable fiber web like card-stock. The object connector  may also be manufactured by the process of injection molding.The object connector  may be used in many applications. For example, it may be used to create sculptures or other structures out of playing cards, credit cards, card stock, and/or other objects. It may also be used to change the presentation of some planar material into a more aesthetic form. It may also be used with objects made from sturdier materials, such as cardboard, balsa wood, and fiberboard, to form shelves, bins, and partitions.The object connector  has many qualities that make it suitable for use as, for example, a construction toy. The object connector  is designed to be durable and can be used with many types of household objects. This allows users to be imaginative in what materials to use in their structure. The object connector  is easy to use, compact, and inexpensive to manufacture, therefore affordable to many.Numerous modifications and alternative embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the foregoing description. Accordingly, this description is to be construed as illustrative only and is for the purpose of teaching those skilled in the art the best mode for carrying out the present invention. Details of the structure may vary substantially without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.Although the object connector is described with reference to the example embodiments illustrated in the figures, it should be understood that the object connector may be embodied in many alternative forms. One of ordinary skill in the art will additionally appreciate different ways to alter the parameters of the embodiments disclosed, such as the size, shape, elements, or materials, without departing from the spirit and scope of the object connector."

                "This application is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/636,259 filed 11 Dec. 2009, concerns further improvements to the invention described in the specifications of International Patent Application No. PCT/AU2008/000839 filed 12 Jun. 2008 andInternational Patent Application No, PCT/AU2010/000240 filed 2 Mar. 2010, and claims priority of Australian Provisional Application No. 2010903642 filed 13 Aug. 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by cross-reference.]This invention concerns a method for mechanically connecting two or more components together. In one aspect, the invention concerns components having keyway arrangements and a keyway connector having keys retainable by the keyway arrangements so as to lock the components together to form a secure joint.Although the components and keyway connector can be made of any suitable type of material or materials, the invention is particularly suited to joining components and a keyway connector made of plastics material and will therefore be chiefly described in that context. Again, it is to be understood that the components and keyway connector need not be made of plastics material and can be made of any suitable material or materials suited for the intended application.Plastic is a versatile material that can be rotationally cast, injection moulded, heated and vacuum or pressure formed and even draped over form-work to make a variety of shapes for various purposes. For mass production, injection moulding is a preferred method because it is fast, energy efficient and gives more precision of shape and size. It is, however, limiting in that internal cavities can't be made without welding or gluing the components together. For some plastics, especially those in the polyolefin group like the very popular polypropylene, gluing is not normally successful, so welding or using mechanical compression fittings and seals is the only real joining alternative. Compression fittings are limited in how big they can be in practice because of expense. They are also predominantly used for standard sized pipe as making compression fittings for the variety of shapes required for consumer items is not practical. Even if it were practical for small items, moulded compression fittings are not practical nor cost effective for large plastic pails, so in these circumstances fabrication and welding is the only realistic alternative.Several methods of welding are practiced. Butt welding involves cutting and cleaning both surfaces to be joined and then heating them before they are pushed together while still molten. This type of joint can leave an internal weld bead which is difficult to remove and can cause ragging that could lead to blockages when used for sewer pipelines. Fusion welding, where fittings have electrical resistance wire built into the components to melt the plastic, is also popular. Fusion joints can be pushed together whilst clean, then electrical energy is used to heat the bonding surfaces of the joint to fuse the parts together and so achieve a good seal. Other forms of welding include ultrasonic and hot air welding and both are time consuming and require specialist equipment and skills to bond joints successfully and safely. All forms of welding can produce toxic fumes and require good ventilation or breathing apparatus to be worn.This significantly limits the uses to which plastics could otherwise be put, because it is time consuming and expensive to fabricate good quality joints on large components. Also, getting smooth curves when cold bending plastics for fabricated components is problematic and so is seldom done commercially.Drums and pails are commonly used for the storage of hazardous or messy liquids and powders. They must have positive seals that are robust, even when dropped. Commonly used bucket type clips are prone to leakage, have a limited shelf life and once opened are no longer very effective. Threads provide a positive joining method but are expensive to mould, especially on large plastic components, and if they become too large they are very difficult to undo or tighten in real world conditions. Threads also are limited to use on circular joint face profiles with planar joint faces.The present inventors have now developed a general connecting method for connecting two or more components together which may be made of plastics material or of any other suitable type of material. Described herein are further improvements in the connecting mechanism described in the specifications of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/636,259, International Patent Application No. PCT/AU2008/000839 and International Patent Application No. PCT/AU2010/000240 In one or more embodiments the connecting mechanism minimises or overcomes one or more of the component-joining problems referred to above.According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for connecting at least a first component and a second component together, wherein each said component comprises at least one keyway arrangement having one or more keyways extending along the component, said method comprising the steps of:aligning the keyway arrangements of the first and second components such that the keyways provide a keyway passage extending longitudinally between the keyways; andextending a keyway connector longitudinally within the keyway passage such that the keyway connector engages the keyways of the keyway arrangements to lock the first and second components together.According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for connecting at least a first component and a second component together, wherein each said component comprises at least one keyway arrangement extending along the component and keyways of the keyway arrangement are spaced apart from one another, said method comprising the steps of:aligning the keyway arrangements of the first and second components such that the keyways intermesh to provide a keyway passage extending longitudinally between the intermeshed keyways; andextending a keyway connector comprising an arrangement of keys longitudinally within the keyway passage such that the keys engage the keyways of the keyway arrangements to lock the first and second components together.The present invention also relates to at least a first component, a second component and a keyway connector as defined above when used for the method according to the first or second aspects.Each keyway arrangement and its keyway/s may extend along each component or a remainder/body of each component in any suitable way. For instance, the keyway arrangement may extend along a face, surface, edge, perimeter and/or periphery of the component. The form of each keyway arrangement will depend on the nature of each component and how they are to be connected to one another.Each component and keyway arrangement may be of any suitable size, shape and construction, and may be made of any suitable material or materials. The component and keyway arrangement may be planar, angular, bent, arcuate, convex, concave, annular, tubular (circular or non-circular), discoid, conical, tapered, cylindrical, rectangular or of any other simple or complex geometry. Each component and keyway arrangement may consist of metal, an alloy, plastics material, ceramics or rubber, including steel or polyurethane, or any combination of these. The keyway arrangement and component/remainder of the component need not be made of the same material or materials.Each keyway arrangement may comprise any suitable number of keyways and the keyways may be of any suitable size, shape and construction, provided that they can engage and preferably retain the keys of the keyway connector so as to lock the components together to form a secure joint. In a preferred embodiment, each keyway is in the form of a hook and each key is shaped so as to be retained by the hook.Each keyway may have a connector-support portion and a key-retaining portion. The connector-support portion may extend beneath the keyway connector and the key-retaining portion may extend around a key. The key-retaining portion may be arcuate, angular or both.Each keyway arrangement may comprise series of individual keyways or a body and keyway/s extending from the body. The keyway arrangement may comprise a body, for example, in the form of a planar, tubular, arcuate or annular strip or ring, and the keyways may extend from the body along a length of the body. The body and/or keyway/s, if annular or tubular, may be conical or tapered. The keyways may have the general appearance of a sine, square, triangle or sawtooth waveform, having both peaks and troughs. One or more of the troughs may support the connector support portion of an intermeshed keyway. The keyways may extend from one or both longitudinal sides of the body.The keyways of the keyway arrangements may intermesh with one another in any suitable way. If first and second components are to be connected together, then each keyway of the first component may be located immediately adjacent a keyway of the second component.More than two components may be connected together. For instance, if first, second and third components are to be connected together, then the keyway of one component may be flanked by a respective keyway of each other component, although this need not necessarily be the sequence of keyways.Each component may have more than one keyway arrangement extending along the component. This would allow a component to be directly connected to two or more other components at the same time, thus enabling an endless number of complex structures to be assembled.Each keyway arrangement may be connectable, permanently connected or detachably connected to a component or remainder/body of the component, and this may be achieved in any suitable way. For instance, the keyway arrangement body may be receivable within a groove, pocket or a fold of the component. Alternatively, or additionally, the keyway arrangement may be welded, fused, melted, glued, nailed, screwed or otherwise adhered, affixed or fastened to the component or remainder of the component. The keyway arrangement and component or remainder of the component may be of unitary construction.The keyway connector may be of any suitable size, shape and construction, and may be made of any suitable material or materials. The keyway connector may consist of metal, an alloy, plastics material, ceramics or rubber, including steel or polyurethane, or any combination of these. The keyway connector need not be made of the same material as the first and second components/keyway arrangements. The keyway connector may be of unitary construction or may comprise two or more detachably connected pieces. An end of a first keyway connector piece may interference fit with an end of an adjacent second keyway connector piece. Alternatively, one end of an annular keyway connector may interference fit with the other end of the same connector (ie. a split-ring structure).Preferably, the keyway connector has an elongate body and, for the connection of two components, the keys extend laterally off the body from opposite sides of the body. The keyway connector body may be in the form of a planar, tubular, arcuate or annular strip or ring, and the keys may extend from the body along a length of the body. The body and/or keyways, if annular or tubular, may be conical or tapered.In one embodiment, a single key may extend laterally off each opposing side of the body. In another embodiment, each side of the body may have a plurality of keys extending within the same plane and the keys may be spaced apart from one another in accordance with the spacing of the keyways, and the position of the keys may alternate from one side of the body to the other along a length of the body. With the keys in this arrangement, the keys may be slid into locking engagement with the keyways or slid out of locking engagement with the keyways. If the keyways are in the form of hooks, then the keyway connector may be removed from the keyway passage in a lateral direction between the intermeshed hooks when not in locking engagement with the keyways.The keyways and keyway connector may engage so that they may releasably unlocked or they may engage so that they cannot be unlocked without destroying the joint. This may be achieved in any suitable way. They may also engage such that the keyway connector can be reversibly fixed or held to prevent it accidentally unlocking with stress cycling. A lofted keyway profile or lofted keyway connector profile may be used to achieve this or alternatively any number of other methods that will be obvious to those skilled in the art may be used, e.g. notches, positive-lock arrangement, insertable keys, tabs, grub screws or other methods.The keys of the keyway connector may simply interference fit with the keyways and/or the keyway connector may be used as a cam lock. If the latter, the keyway connector may be rotated relative to its longitudinal axis between locking and unlocking positions. In the unlocking position, the keyway connector may be inserted into the keyway passage and be movable relative to the keyways, and in the locking position the keys of the keyway connector may forcefully engage the keyways. Moving the keyway connector between the locking and unlocking positions may involve rotating the keyway connector through an angle of about 90° relative to its longitudinal axis.The keyway connector may comprise a handle, lobe or grip surface extending from or along the body. The connector may have any suitable type of handle. Preferably, the handle extends almost the length of the body but for some applications it may be located at or near one end or both ends. The handle may have openings for fingers or other tools located between an upper surface of the handle and an upper surface of the body. The handle may be removable or engage with a variety of gripping surfaces that can be formed onto a suitable face of the keyway connector.Alternatively or additionally, the keyway connector may comprise a structural component extending from or along the body. This structural component may be, for example, planar, angular, bent, arcuate, convex, concave, annular, discoid, conical, tapered, cylindrical, rectangular, rounded or of any other simple or complex geometry. This structural component may connect with another said component. The structural component may provide a decorative finish and/or a barrier.The keyway connector may further comprise one or more travel stops or similar integrated mechanisms extending from the keyway connector body, for restricting the degree of longitudinal movement of the body within the keyway passage.The method may comprise the step of connecting the components together using a further connecting mechanism. Such a mechanism may include mating male and female regions, such as, for example, a key and keyway arrangement, a tongue and groove arrangement, a pin and hole arrangement and so forth being located between abutting faces or edges of the components.The method may further comprise the step of introducing a sealing member between the components before connecting them together, so as to render the connection fluid-tight (including water tight and/or air-tight). Any suitable type of sealing member may be used (e.g. a gasket or O-ring). A sealing member may be extended along abutting faces or edges of the components either as a loose fit or temporarily or permanently fixed, bonded, fused, adhered or attached by any other suitable means to the abutting faces or edges of the components.Alternatively, abutting faces or edges of the components themselves may be shaped to provide a sealing function. For example, one or more of the components may have an integrally formed (eg. moulded) sealing member.In a first embodiment, the first component is in the form of a container and the second component is in the form of a closure for the container. The keyway arrangements may extend along a circumference of the container and closure, and the keyway connector may be annular.In a second embodiment, the first component is in the form of a cylindrical wall section of a tank and the second component is in the form of discoid base connectable to the wall section of the tank. The keyway arrangements may extend along a circumference of the wall section and base, and the keyway connector may be annular. In this embodiment, a third component in the form of a cylindrical wall section of the tank may be connectable to a free end of the other wall section, again by way of an annular keyway connector.In a third embodiment, the first and second components are in the form of panels or beams that are connectable edge to edge or face to face such that they extend substantially in the same plane or at different angles relative to one another. The keyway arrangements may extend along an edge or face of each panel or beam, and a body of the keyway connector may be longitudinal. In this embodiment, any suitable number of additional panels or beams may be connected to the first and second components so as to form, for example, floors, form-work, scaffolding, architectural beams and other types of building elements.In a fourth embodiment, the components are in the form of pipes or general tubular members that are connectable end to end. Each keyway arrangement may extend along a circumference of the pipe or tubular or conical member at or adjacent the pipe end or tubular or conical member end that is to be connected. The components may be of the same diameter or of differing diameter, and one or more of the components may be conical or tapered. The pipe or tubular member may have a circular or non-circular cross-section, including a rectangular, triangular, hexagonal or octagonal cross-section. One or more of the components may have a flanged end.The keyway arrangement may comprise a body in the form of an arcuate, tubular or annular strip or ring, and the keyways may extend from the body along a length of the body. The keyways may have the appearance of a sine, square, triangle or sawtooth waveform, having both peaks and troughs. The keyways may extend from one or both longitudinal sides of the body.The keyway arrangement may be permanently connected or detachably connected to the pipe or tubular member or a remainder of the pipe or tubular member, and this may be achieved in any suitable way. For instance, the keyway arrangement body may be of integral/unitary construction with the pipe or tubular member. For instance, the keyway arrangement body may be receivable within or retainable by a groove or fold of the pipe or tubular member. For instance, the keyway arrangement body may be connectable to or otherwise engageable with a flange of the pipe or tubular member. Alternatively, or additionally, the keyway arrangement may be welded, fused, melted, glued, nailed, screwed or otherwise adhered, affixed or fastened to the pipe or tubular member or remainder of the pipe or tubular member.The keyway connector may comprise an arcuate, annular, tubular or ring body or a split ring body or multi-piece body, and keys of the keyway connector may be spaced along a circumference of the keyway connector body. The keys may be slid between adjacent keyways of the keyway arrangements and rotated into locking engagement with the keyways. The keys may extend generally in line with a central axis of the arcuate, annular or ring body and/or the keys may extend generally or otherwise point radially relative to a central axis of the body. The keyway connector may be able to ride over the keyways when the keyway connector is being inserted into the continuous keyway passage. In one embodiment, the keys are spaced apart by curved recessed sections that help the keyway connector ride over keyways when the keyway connector is being inserted into the continuous keyway passage.The first and second components may each be in the form of a pipe or tube having a flanged end with the keyway arrangements extending around and over abutting flanged ends of said pipes or tubes.According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided an assembly comprising at least a first component, a second component and a keyway connector, wherein each said component comprises at least one keyway arrangement having one or more keyways extending along the component, wherein the keyway arrangements of the first and second components are aligned such that the keyways provide a keyway passage extending longitudinally between the keyways, and the keyway connector extends longitudinally within the keyway passage so as to lock the first and second components together.According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided an assembly comprising at least a first component, a second component and a keyway connector, wherein each said component comprises at least one keyway arrangement extending along the component and keyways of the keyway arrangement are spaced apart from one another, wherein the keyway arrangements of the first and second components are aligned such that the keyways intermesh to provide a keyway passage extending longitudinally between the intermeshed keyways, and the keyway connector comprises an arrangement of keys and extends longitudinally within the keyway passage such that the keys engage the keyways of the keyway arrangements to lock the first and second components together.The components, keyway assemblies and keyway connector of the assembly may be as described above.According to a preferred form of the present invention, there is provided a method for connecting at least a first component and a second component together, wherein each said component comprises a keyway arrangement extending along a body of the component and keyways of the keyway arrangement are spaced apart from one another but connected to the body of the components to be joined, said method comprising the steps of:aligning the keyway arrangements of the first and second components such that the keyways intermesh to provide a series of opposing keyways forming a keyway passage extending longitudinally between laterally juxtapositioned intermeshed keyways; andinserting a keyway connector comprising a corresponding arrangement of keys longitudinally within the keyway passage such that when the keyway connector is moved longitudinally in the keyway passage the keys engage with and are retained by the keyway passage of the keyway arrangements and at the same time force the keyways apart laterally and so tightening jointing surfaces of the bodies.The components and keyway connector may be as described above.According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for connecting at least a first component and a second component together, wherein at least the first said component comprises two or more spaced apart keyway arrangements, with each said arrangement having one or more keyways extending along the component that provide a keyway passage extending longitudinally between the keyways, said method comprising the steps of:extending part of the second component within the keyway passage; andextending a keyway connector longitudinally within the keyway passage such that the keyway connector engages the keyways of the keyway arrangements to lock the first and second components together.According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, there is provided an assembly comprising at least a first component, a second component and a keyway connector, wherein at least the first said component comprises two or more spaced apart keyway arrangements, with each said arrangement having one or more keyways extending along the component that provide a keyway passage extending longitudinally between the keyways, wherein part of the second component extends within the keyway passage, and the keyway connector extends longitudinally within the keyway passage so as to lock the first and second components together.The components and keyway connector of the method and assembly may be as described above.

Once a keyway connector extends within the passage , it can be slid relative to the keyways ,  until the keys engage and are retained by the keyways ,  so as to lock the container halves ,  together and to form a secure planar joint. To disconnect the container halves ,  from one another, the keyway connector is slid within the passage until the keys no longer engage the keyways , .Referring now to , there is shown a container assembly  (preferably made of plastics material) comprising a container base  and closure  connected together with four keyway connectors .A keyway arrangement extends along an upper joining edge of container base  and comprises a plurality of regularly spaced hooked keyways  (only some of which have been labeled). A castellated keyway arrangement also extends along a periphery of closure  and comprises a plurality of regularly spaced (non-hooked) keyways  (only some of which have been labeled).Each keyway connector  comprises a longitudinal body  with keys  extending laterally off an upper side of the body. A single key  extends along a lower side of each body . Put another way, the lower side of the body  serves as key  and interference fits with keyways .Keys  extend in a common plane and are regularly spaced from one another in a castellated manner such that they match the spacing of keyways  when intermeshed.Each keyway connector  can be inserted laterally and slid longitudinally within a keyway passage (as described for other embodiments).

These can be made of any suitable material or materials, such as metal or plastics material.

A continuous (un-castellated) key (not labeled) extends along a lower side of the body .An annular keyway passage extends between keyways  and the keyway provided by the planar surface of the housing .The discoid lens component , when inserted into this keyway passage, essentially forms a smaller keyway passage into which the keyway connector  fits. There may be one or more substantially discoid components laminated between this uncastellated keyway surface and keyway connector .Because of the split in the keyway connector body , it can be flexed laterally under the keyway  hooks so that the castellated keys  lie between them prior to extending the keyway connector  longitudinally underneath the hook shaped keyways . This action wedges and retains a smooth edged discoid component  between the uncastellated surface of the housing  and the key/lower side of the keyway connector body .shows that the connecting mechanism of the present invention can be used to assemble different shape components into complex structures  (such as an aircraft wing). These can be made of, for example, metal and/or plastics material.A cross-shaped keyway connector  serves as a bracing and tie element. The keyway connector  has four diverging aims and keys , , ,  located at an end of each arm. Keys , , ,  engage four different pairs of keyway arrangements , , , , which arrangement pairs , , ,  connect adjacent arcuate panels , , ,  together. Additional pairs of keyway arrangements , , ,  and keyway connectors , , ,  provide additional joint strength as well as rounded external surfaces for aesthetic purposes.Although not entirely clear from the figure, a single key may extend laterally off each opposing side of each arm—rather than a plurality of spaced keys extending laterally off each opposing side of each arm. That is, the keyway connectors shown in  need not have castellated keys, but can rather can have a leading edge that allows the key to be inserted from one side.Referring now to , there is shown some of the differently shaped keyways  according to the present invention. Each keyway  is in the form of a hook having a connector-support portion  and a key-retaining portion  (only some of which have been labeled). Depending on the intended application, each key-retaining portion  may be arcuate and/or angular, provided that it can extend part way around a key  of a keyway connector,Referring now to , there is shown two ends ,  of an annular keyway connector interference fitting together, or two ends ,  of adjacent keyway connectors interference fitting together. Multiple short keyway connectors interference fitting together could be used for large components having a long keyway passage, that could otherwise be difficult to join together using a single keyway connector.Referring now to , there is shown a panel assembly  comprising an upper panel component , a lower panel component  and a keyway connector  (preferably made of plastics material). A keyway arrangement extends along a lower edge of the upper panel  and comprises a plurality of regularly spaced hooked keyways . A keyway arrangement also extends along an upper edge of the upper panel  and comprises a plurality of regularly spaced hooked keyways . The keyways ,  intermesh and provide a keyway passage as previously described in respect of .The keyway connector  comprises an elongate body  having a cross-sectional shape of a rounded oblong (ovoid). Opposing arcuate sides of the body function as keys  that can engage and be retained by the keyways , . The body  has openings  for tools for rotating the connector  relative to its longitudinal axis through a  degree rotation, between locking (as seen in ) and unlocking positions. The connector  functions as a cam lock.The keyway connector  can be inserted laterally and slide longitudinally within the keyway passage when in the unlocked position. Once the keyway connector  extends within the passage, it can be rotated through an angle of about 90 degrees to the locking position, in which position the keys  forcefully engage the keyways ,  and lock the panels ,  together.Referring now to , there is shown a panel assembly  much like assembly . The major differences are that the panel components ,  are slightly different and keyways ,  are of smaller width and spacing relative to one another. Also, tools openings are not shown for keyway connector  of the assembly . The keyway connector  is shown in an unlocked position.Referring now to , there is shown an assembly  comprising upper  and lower  arcuate components connected together with keyway connectors . Again, assembly  is much like assembly . The major differences are that the components ,  and the keyway connector  are arcuate, and keyways ,  are of greater width and spacing relative to one another.Since the joint is of an arcuate nature, more than one keyway connector  (or a multi-piece connector) is used. As for assembly , each connector  can be inserted laterally and slide longitudinally within a keyway passage when in an unlocked position. Once the keyway connector  extends within the passage, it can be rotated through an angle of about 90 degrees to a locking position, in which position keys of the connector  forcefully engage the keyways ,  and lock the components ,  together.Referring now to , there is shown an assembly  comprising two components ,  and a keyway connector  (preferably made of plastics material). Component  has an arcuate pocket  having a linear array of slits . The pocket  also has a keyway arrangement whereby keyways  of the arrangement are provided by non-slitted regions of the pocket . The keyways  extend transversely of the pocket . This can be best seen in .An edge of component  also has a keyway arrangement consisting of four hooked keyways . The keyways  may be extended into the pocket  by way of the slits .The keyway connector  is essentially the same as connector  of . Opposing arcuate sides of a body of the connector  function as keys that can engage and be retained by the keyways . The body also has handles or openings for tools to act as handles for rotating the connector  relative to its longitudinal axis through a 90 degree rotation, between locking and unlocking positions. The connector  functions as a cam to lever the keyways apart and lock the joint.The keyway connector  can be inserted laterally and slide longitudinally within the keyway passage when in the unlocked position. Once the keyway connector  extends within the passage, it can be rotated through an angle of about 90 degrees to the locking position, in which position the keys forcefully engage the keyways ,  and lock the components ,  together.  show the connector  in the locked position (wing brace joint) whereas  show the connector  in the unlocked position. In the locked position, the keyways  bear against a non-slitted region of the pocket , as seen in .The connecting method as exemplified above (except as shown in the ,  and ) involves creating a series of intermeshing (castellated) keyways along a jointing face and extending below the joint plane on each component. The keyways are shaped to retain keys of a keyway connector. The connector can be made of one or several curved or straight profiles made to match the profiles of the joint face, and has complementary keys which allow it to be inserted between opposing keyways in such a way that by moving the connector parallel to the joint face the assembly can be positively locked into position, with the keyways shaped to retain the keys in position when the joint is placed. The keyway connector bends to take the loads imposed by the components on the joint. This spring tensioning force is an important part of the connecting mechanism and distinguishes it markedly from a typical hinge, which it superficially resembles. (The hinge pin experiences a shear force at the junctions of the hinge castellations, rather than a flexural force.)The present connecting method overcomes several component joining problems especially (although not exclusively) for larger plastic components and also has application for smaller components especially where a sealed internal cavity is required. With this connecting method it is much cheaper and faster to produce injection moulding and pressing methods can in many circumstances be substituted for more expensive and limiting rotational moulding, welding, bolting and threading.The present invention delivers a strong and, if necessary, gas tight joint that is more robust to shock loads. It is much faster to make than traditional joining methods and the flexible, but strong, holding technique allows successful joints to be made even where the parts are made of traditionally incompatible, brittle or innovative composite materials.The connecting mechanism is straight forward to produce using existing mass production techniques, such as injection moulding, forging, pressing, casting, fabricating, moulding, extrusion, roll forming, punching and laser cutting.The present connecting method has the advantage of providing a strong positive joint and being able to be moulded, wrought or extruded more cheaply than for other joins in a wide variety of applications ranging from aviation industry, construction through to buildings and consumer products.Further uses and advantages of the present invention are described below.The Present Connecting Method Supports Complex Joint Faces and PlanesUnlike a traditional helical thread the present connecting method can be made to conform to complex shapes involving straight edges and convex and concave multi-radius organic curves, and can even be made to seal non-planar joints and non-contiguous joint lines which in the past could only be joined by bolted flanges or welding. Vehicles, especially cars and planes, are good examples of products which have many such joins and because of the limitations of welded, bolted, screwed and riveted joins they are expensive to mass produce and especially to repair after structural damage. It also means that they can not be easily made of more light weight flexible materials like injection moulded plastics or plastic/fibre composites or pressed or cast carbon fibre composites without much greater expense. Joint planes are often a weak point in large designs because they provide an opportunity for shear stresses along a flat plane. Threaded joints have the disadvantage that they can either over tighten or unscrew when deployed on a driven shaft and grub screws and conventional keyways damage or interfere with thread seals and can shear off under load. The present connecting method allows components to be designed for high torque joints that substitute much more robust compressive forces for shear forces through the use of serrated, castellated, sinuous or even randomly juxtapositioned joint “planes”.The Present Connecting Method Allows for Multi-component and Multi-material Interlocking JoinsMulti-component interfaces can also be constructed using the present connecting method that would be virtually impossible to mould because of undercuts and parting plane complexity. Joints can be constructed using one material or completely dissimilar materials. For example, one joint component in a multi-component assembly could be made of ceramics, one of metal and one of plastic, and the keyway connector could be made of yet another material to achieve different structural outcomes for each joint.The Present Connecting Method Allows for Tailored Joint RigidityIn some cases a very rigid inflexible joint may be required, so the components could be made of very high tensile materials and more keyway and keyway connector interference could be designed so that the joint is prestressed when locked up to compensate for the forces expected when the joint is under stress. In other cases a flexible joint that can withstand and flex under shock loads is required so a tough but elastic material would be chosen for the keyway connector or components.The Present Connecting Method Allows for a Join Without Reorienting the Key ComponentsMany dissimilar non-weldable materials are joined in electrical and automotive assemblies. Insulating plastics and metals are a good example. The components can often not be screwed together because connecting wires will tangle short circuit or break if rotated so the components are either over-moulded or crimped together making them disposable items, even though they could easily be repaired were it not for the difficulty of opening and resealing the joints. The keyway connector joint would be a much better way to provide a positive non-screwed joint where the keyway connector moves but the components remain in the correct relationship to each other.The Present Connecting Method Promotes Higher Levels of ReuseAnother application for the present connecting method is for reusable plastic pails. The seals between the lid and buckets, once broken, are not suitable for storing hazardous or messy materials. They also have a limited life span as the plastic relaxes over time and can leak air in, which could react with the contents, or the contents could leak out. Making the existing bucket type clip seal more rigid by thickening the profile or increasing the interference is not always an option as, if it becomes too stiff, the lid can not be removed manually and levers may permanently damage the clip or seal. This in practice limits the size of the clip seal too, as a larger diameter clip seal will be too hard to unclip. The keyway connector is a much more positive seal and can be reused many times, thus reducing materials consumption. It also enables a replaceable spout or funnel to be quickly connected to the rim of the container so that the contents can be decanted to another container more safely and cleanly.The Present Connecting Method Allows for Bigger SealsBecause joints utilising the keyway connector can be clamped up incrementally, it is possible to quickly make huge sealed joints that would be otherwise impossible to make other than by welding them. On very large tanks, for example, plastics are seldom used despite their superior corrosion resistance to metals because they have to be fabricated in situ. The present connecting method will allow large tanks to be economically constructed using prefabricated panels that can be transported in compact stacks and assembled quickly on site as it doesn't require expensive and noisy generators or heavy batteries as hot wire, butt or hot air seam welding does.The Present Connecting Method Provides Structural BracingOn large diameter water tanks the internal force of water will tend to open up joints and stretch the wall material. Because the keyway can be designed to wedge parts together in two directions so that the keyway connector itself can be wedged into high friction contact with the parts, so the keyway connector can be made to act like a continuous lateral rib providing enormous hoop strength and stiffness to a structure and can even be used to create a box girder construction to increase stiffness without greatly increasing cost or wall thickness. This is particularly important where the box beam constructed is to be used as sacrificial or reusable formwork for long spans in building and construction applications such as, for example, bridge beams, structural girders, light or power poles, elevated water header towers, multi-storey building shells and suspended flooring.Long curvilinear beams in particular can be constructed in situ using lightweight plastic formwork that can even be hollow to save materials and then have reinforced concrete pumped into it in a continuous operation. In corrosive or highly saline or seaside environments, where corrosion of concrete reinforcing steel is a billion dollar problem, the sealed formwork can simply be sacrificed to permanently protect the concrete.Passages can be moulded into the formwork for reinforcing steel, or alternative reinforcing materials such as high tensile plastic strapping materials can be used and by sequential casting of multiple cavity formwork, the reinforcing materials can be prestressed in situ. Aesthetic patterns can be cast or moulded into the surface of visible sacrificial formwork, or onto the relief side of reusable formwork.The Present Connecting Method Allows for Greater Transport EfficiencyTransportation of large tanks and components is very expensive, as they are inherently bulky. There is a heavy greenhouse gas emission associated with essentially moving air large distances. The present connecting method will allow tanks to be cheaply transported in nested stacks or panels that can be assembled at or near the final destination.The Present Connecting Method Supports Much Greater Design FlexibilityModern vernacular architecture is boxy and boring predominantly because of the horrendous cost of fabricating complex surface formwork. The huge cost blow out on the construction of the iconic Sydney Opera House is a salient reminder to architects and subconsciously informs their conservative rectilinear designs. Complex compound shell structures can become as affordable as more staid design by using the present connecting method. Extremely complex forms can be fabricated and replicated in a variety of arrays using a suite of tangentially interfacing interlocking panel forms. Light weight and rapid to transport and erect shell structures can be made for prefabricated plastic housing for temporary shelters in refugee or other humanitarian housing crisis situations. And by burying structural shells, passive super energy efficient earth sheltered structures could be made more affordable than conventional prefabricated box construction houses.The Present Connecting Method Allows for Extruded ComponentsWhere long wall profiles are required, such as in large diameter tanks, the wall profile can be extruded and the keyways either punched off during extrusion or co-moulded. This will allow very large wall sections to be made of any material that can be extruded, such as various grades and alloys of aluminium, steel, plastic and the like. It would even be practical to construct low cost pressure vessels or large underground storage tanks using this technique.The Present Connecting Method Allows for Securing Smooth Edged ComponentsWhere it is required to attach a smooth edged component such as a spotlight lens into a reflector housing, for instance, a keyway passage can be formed which has one side formed by the smooth edge and the other side formed by the castellated hooks of the keyway arrangement. The keyway connector would then only have keys arranged on one side. Such an arrangement is illustrated in .The there are some cases where there are advantages from using a non-castellated keyway connector which has a singe key on each side of the keyway connector. If the frictional forces are high however from the interference fit into the keyway it may be impossible to draw the keyway connector through a long keyway passage. An alternative is to shape the keyway in the form of a cam that can be easily inserted between the keyways when twisted 90 degrees from its locked position. Locking can then be accomplished by rotating the key 90 degrees in either direction after insertion,  illustrate this embodiment. Depending on the flexibility of the locking keyway connector and the diameter of an annular keyway passage it is still possible to employ this method. The natural memory of the flexible keyway connectors can be employed to advantage to stabilize the keyway connector from rolling and allowing the joint to loosen. This arrangement is shown in .There is often a need to join the edge of one part to the face of another. In this application the two parts can be stitched together by punching a linear array of slots across the sheet to allow the hook shaped keyway ends to penetrate through and be locked in position by any suitable keyway connector as illustrated in  (the wing brace joint). The joint could be recessed and keyway connector could also have a cosmetic face so that the joint results in a smooth surface profile as would be required for aerodynamic structural elements.Referring now to  there is show a slip flange assembly  for connecting respective flanged ends of two pipes ,  together.The slip flange assembly  comprises a first collar , a second collar  and a two-part keyway connector , as seen in .The first collar  has a keyway arrangement  extending from a circumference of the collar .

When in mating arrangement flanges  and  secure collars  and  to the respective ends of pipes  and  and also help to form a seal around the circumference of each pipe , .Referring now to , there is shown a panel assembly  comprising a first panel , a second panel  and a keyway arrangement ,  extending along an abutting corrugated edge of each panel , . These can be made of metal or plastics material, for example.Each keyway ,  of each keyway arrangement ,  has a connector-support portion and a key-retaining portionAs seen in , a keyway connector  of the assembly  comprises a flat longitudinal body  and keys  extending from one side of the body , and keys  extending from an opposite side of the body .Keys  extend in a common plane and are regularly spaced from one another. The spacing of keys  matches the spacing of keyways . Keys  also extend in a common plane and are regularly spaced from one another. The spacing of keys  matches the spacing of keyways . Keys  and  are off-set relative to one another along a length of the body  in the same manner as keyways  and  when intermeshed.The keyways ,  can intermesh with one another such that each keyway  is straddled by keyways  of the other arrangement. Keyways  and  intermesh to provide a continuous keyway passage  extending longitudinally between the intermeshed keyways ,  (the arrow as seen in ).The keyway connector  can be inserted and slid longitudinally within the continuous keyway passage , as seen in . Once inserted, each key-retaining portion is potentially positioned to extend around a key , ,Once the keyway connector  extends within the passage , it can be slid relative to the keyways ,  until the keys ,  engage the keyways ,  and are retained by the keyways ,  so as to lock the panels ,  together to form a tight joint. To disconnect panel  from panel , the keyway connector  is slid within the passage  until the keys ,  no longer engage the keyways , .A method of joining components of various shapes and cross sectional profiles (polygonal, round, oval or freeform) is described in . The joint disclosed largely overcomes the problems with conventional bolted flange type joints and, in addition, has the advantages of using less materials for the same strength, being faster to assemble and disassemble and, importantly, virtually eliminating human error in achieving correct joint tensioning,One or more of these embodiments, however, have the disadvantage that the joint can only be made by bringing the two faces to be joined together longitudinally. The projecting castellations/keyways may prevent the two faces from being brought together laterally as is required for lift out valves and other such pipe applications, in particular. This constraint could prevent use of those embodiments in these types of applications.The embodiments of the invention described herein in  and - overcome this limitation by constructing a curved, straight and or twisted joining strip that can be bonded to or more simply mechanically engaged against an adjoining hook or stepped surface that is formed on a part parallel to and displaced to either or both sides of the part joining faces. This hooked or stepped surface should ideally be shaped so that under load the strip anchor surfaces are drawn into tighter engagement with the body of the parts to be joined and so there should preferably be an acute rather than an obtuse angle on the surface designed to anchor the tensile forces generated by the joint engagement. This arrangement obviates the need for the two materials to be chemically or physically bonded together and indeed allows the joint so formed to be easily disassembled if required.Importantly, these embodiments allow for very complex surface mating geometry such as saw tooth, corrugated or castellated mating surfaces to be constructed using simple fabrication techniques such as folding or rolling of metal edges to form a hook on the mating edges. The strips can be applied after the mating surfaces are engaged and can be removed before they are disengaged. The alignment of the castellations longitudinally becomes non-critical as the strips can be slid longitudinally into engagement during assembly.For applications to flat panels (as per the embodiment shown in ), in particular such as knock down furniture, a dovetail groove can be formed into the wooden or fibre composite panel and a matching dovetail anchor on the strip can be slid into the grove. The advantages of this arrangement are that under high stress loading on the joint the bending moment on the hooks tends to exert beneficial forces back into the part thus helping counteract the opposing bending moment which would otherwise tend to flex the anchor away from the body of the part. This is important in that it allows the strip to be applied during assembly as manageable segments of varying length thus making it applicable to a wider range of industrial joining situations. It also means the materials used can be more varied. The strip could be mass produced of a material that was physically or chemically incompatible with the part but can still form a good joint even though the parts can't be glued or welded. For example an extruded or injection moulded thermoplastic strip could be mass produced then cut to the correct length and rapidly applied to a metal sheet with a tightly folded hook along its edge to engage and anchor a strip. See the embodiment of , for example. Alternatively, plastic parts could have a steel strip applied that used yet a third material with desirable properties for the key. In sonic circumstances it will be an advantage for the anchoring hook part of the joining strip to be clipped into and retained firmly by a mating surface or groove in the anchoring region of the part so that multiple strips can be applied and remain in place until the key is used to engage and lock together the whole assembly. The same effect can be achieved by creating a variety of interlocking male and female shapes on each end of a keyway strip such that the sections of strip are held together in the correct relationship and do not move out of alignment during the locking up of the joint. In its most fundamental embodiment the keyway castellations could consist of a single keyway hook segment with an anchoring hook on the opposite end and a male mating portion on one side of the anchoring hook and female mating portion on the opposite side so that the two parts dovetail together with adjacent castellations like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle to form a long strip that can mesh with a similar longitudinal strip to form a keyway that can accept a key to lock the joint up securely. Correctly shaped a keyway so formed could suit straight line joints as well as a variety of radial curves (such as pipes) or longitudinal curves (flat or spirally curved joints)An alternative method of achieving the objective of a lateral approach joint that has similar industrial applicability is to apply a series of double ended castellated hooks or longitudinal assemblies of hooks to create a double keyway. In this case two keys are required to complete the joint. To reduce the number of parts involved the two keys can be formed as one part if this is desirable.A further refinement of this principle is illustrated in  and comprises an embodiment where the keyway hooks  and  are spaced apart sufficiently to allow a type of key having a series of keys  attached below the keyway connector body  to be inserted over the keyway hooks and then moved into a locked position in the normal way for this technology. While this principle could be used for straight joints, it is particularly applicable for circular joints such as pipes and fittings where the key can be constructed as a single piece of relatively inflexible material that can be moved over a pipe joint longitudinally and then rotated circumferentially with appropriate mechanical advantage to lock up the joint securely in one operation. For greater servicing and assembly convenience the slip flange arrangement illustrates how the pipe flanges  and  can be made of castellated segments  and  that allow gaps  and  in the flange keyway anchor hook arrangement to pass over these castellated segments of the pipe but rotated to anchor the keyway hook arrangement  and  in position. This anchoring alignment can be preserved during tightening by inserting keys into one or more of gaps  and .Yet further embodiments of the invention are described below.show a further connecting mechanism  comprising two keyway arrangements and a keyway connector  for connecting two tubular members ,  together.

                "The present application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/083,355 filed Jul. 24, 2008 and the entirety of the contents of this application being hereby expressly incorporated by reference.The present invention is directed toward a fastening system, and more particularly, to a fastening system employing a fastener of the type generally referred to as a “push-pin” or “christmas-tree” fastener.Push-pin and christmas-tree fasteners are well known within the art. These fasteners are designed for secure fit and difficult removal while at the same time allowing for easy insertion.A particular challenge in using these types of fasteners, especially in the automotive field, lies in providing a fastener that will afford the most secure attachment in combination with the simplest insertion process and fewest additional parts or insertion steps. Often, improper insertion direction results in loose fit and the risk of separation. Additionally, there is a need for fasteners that can prevent a fastened part from pivoting about the fastener, without the need for additional fasteners or attachments.Other problems include the difficulty in maintaining the fastener centered within an aperture so that it may have less of a tendency to loosen within the aperture or slip out of the aperture completely. A fastener with a basic rounded shank runs the risk of separation with any aperture that is not circular and of similar diameter.The prior art includes many christmas-tree type fasteners. U.S. Pat. No. 3,810,279 discloses a drive fastener having a head, polygonal shaft and axially staggered wings along the shaft. U.S. Pat. No. 4,728,238 discloses another drive fastener having a head, polygonal shank and wings arranged along the shank. U.S. Pat. No. 5,468,108 discloses a spiral tree-fastener having a head and a flattened shank, wherein the shank contains a plurality of flexible wings arranged at an oblique angle with respect to the fastener axis.One problem that arises with the use of some existing fastener structures is that their size and shape do not allow for ideal fit and security within an aperture. This unfortunately results in slipping and disengagement of the fasteners. Further, most push-pin fasteners are not capable of providing secure fastening to a multi-layer substrate, nor do they have the capability of fastening substrates with a wide variety of thicknesses with one standard fastener.As another problem, many push-pin fasteners provide no means to ensure that the fastener is inserted in the ideal position to ensure maximum secure fit. As such, fasteners that are inserted upside-down, sideways or at any other imperfect position, are again subject to rotation, slippage, disengagement, or at the very least, abnormally difficult insertion. Those fasteners that are circular in nature and thus not subject to improper insertion direction often fail to fit securely within any non-circular aperture, resulting in slippage and disengagement.A further issue with many fasteners is that multiple fasteners or additional attachments are often required to prevent slippage, disengagement, or a fastened part from twisting about a fastener. This results in increased parts, labor, and maintenance.The present invention addresses one or more of the above problems, and represents an improvement to existing fasteners for use within vehicles. Accordingly, a fastening system for a vehicle component is disclosed. The fastener typically includes a head or cap and a shank with at least two side walls. At least one of the side walls is typically lined with wing structures. The fastening system further includes a complimentary shaped aperture within a substrate as part of a vehicle component.In a first aspect, the present invention contemplates a fastening system for a vehicle component, comprising: one or more substrate layers wherein the substrate layers have a top and bottom; a polygonal shaped aperture within each of the one or more substrate layers, wherein the aperture has at least two non-parallel opposing walls so that the aperture is non-symmetrical across one axis; a fastener for insertion through the aperture, wherein the fastener includes: a cap surface; a shank extending from the cap surface in the direction of a longitudinal axis wherein the shank includes at least two side walls disposed about the longitudinal axis and the at least two side walls include at least two non-parallel opposing walls so that the shape of the fastener corresponds to the shape of the aperture; a plurality of flexible wings extending outwardly from at least one side wall of the at least two side walls, wherein the plurality of flexible wings are arranged at an acute angle in relation to the longitudinal axis; wherein the plurality of flexible wings are of sufficient number and sufficient flexibility so that at least one flexible wing is in contact with the top of the one or more substrate layers and at least one flexible wing is in contact with the bottom of the one or more substrate layers.This aspect may be further characterized by one or any combination of the following features: the polygonal shaped aperture includes two parallel opposing walls and two non-parallel opposing walls and the fastener includes two parallel opposing side walls and two non-parallel opposing side walls; the plurality of flexible wings are located on at least two side walls of the fastener; there are no flexible wings on the two parallel opposing side walls; the walls of the aperture and the side walls of the fastener are arranged so that they form complimentary isosceles trapezoids, wherein the fastener is capable of secure entry into the aperture; the shank includes a portion; the end of the shank opposite the cap surface narrows; each side wall that contains wings includes at least one wing; each side wall that contains wings includes two distinct sets of adjacent wings so that the two distinct sets of adjacent wings are arranged in a staggered formation.In another aspect, the present invention contemplates a fastening system for a vehicle component, comprising: one or more substrate layers; a trapezoidal shaped aperture within each of the one or more substrate layers, wherein the aperture has two non-parallel opposing side walls so that the aperture is non-symmetrical across one axis; a fastener for insertion through the aperture, wherein the fastener includes: a cap surface; a shank extending from the cap surface in the direction of a longitudinal axis wherein the shank includes four side walls disposed about the longitudinal axis and the four side walls include two non-parallel opposing walls so that the shape of the fastener corresponds to the shape of the aperture; at least one flexible wing extending outwardly from each of at least one of the four side walls, wherein the at least one flexible wing is arranged at an acute angle in relation to the longitudinal axis; wherein the at least one flexible wing is of sufficient number and sufficient flexibility so that the at least one flexible wing is in contact with the one or more substrate layers so that the contact securely engages the at least one flexible wing.This aspect may be further characterized by one or any combination of the following features: each side wall that contains wings includes two distinct sets of adjacent wings so that the two distinct sets of adjacent wings are located in a staggered arrangement; the plurality of flexible wings overlap with any vertically adjacent flexible wings during insertion through an aperture; the one or more substrate layers includes a layer of molded nylon; the fastener is integrated into one or more of the one or more substrate layers and the cap is eliminated; upon insertion into the aperture, the cap surface remains in contact with the top of the one or more substrate layers and all flexible wings have traversed the aperture.In a further aspect, the present invention contemplates an automotive baffle, reinforcement, or seal comprising a trapezoidal shaped aperture placed within a body of the baffle, reinforcement or seal, wherein the aperture extends through all layers of the baffle, reinforcement or seal; and a trapezoidal shaped tree fastener placed within the aperture where two opposing walls are non-parallel and two opposing walls are parallel so that the fastener can only be placed within the aperture in one direction so that each wall of the four walls must engage a corresponding side of the aperture.In another aspect, the present invention contemplates a method of using a fastening system comprising: providing a vehicle component having one or more substrate layers wherein the substrate layers have a top and bottom; providing a trapezoidal shaped aperture within each of the one or more substrate layers, wherein the aperture has two non-parallel opposing walls so that the aperture is non-symmetrical across one axis; providing a fastener for insertion through the aperture, wherein the fastener includes: a cap surface; a shank extending from the cap surface in the direction of a longitudinal axis wherein the shank includes four side walls disposed about the longitudinal axis and the four side walls include two non-parallel opposing walls so that the shape of the fastener corresponds to the shape of the aperture; a plurality of flexible wings extending outwardly from at least one of the four side walls; inserting the fastener into the aperture such that at least one flexible wing is in contact with the top of the one or more substrate layers and at least one flexible wing is in contact with the bottom of the one or more substrate layers.With reference to , there is illustrated an exemplary fastener  of the fastening system of the present invention. In the embodiment shown, the fastener  includes a cap surface , a shank portion , four side walls  defining the shank portion  and six flexible wings  extending from two of the four side walls. However, it is contemplated that the fastener may include fewer or greater than four side walls and fewer or greater than 6 flexible wings extending along the side walls of the shank portion and that the flexible wings may be located on all or less than all of the side walls.The cap surface  is shown as being substantially flat and of larger surface area than any remaining cross section of the shank portion. However, the cap surface may also be conical, triangular, or any other non-flat shape so long as the area of the cap is large enough to prevent slippage of the cap through a corresponding aperture. The cap surface may be separate from or integrated with the shank portion.The shank portion  is being shown as having four side walls wherein at least two of the side walls are lined with flexible wings. However, any number of the side walls may also contain flexible wings. The flexible wings may all be of equal thickness, or the thickness of each row of flexible wings or each flexible wing individually may differ. Similarly, the flexible wings may be of equal lengths, or each row of flexible wings or each flexible wing individually may be of different lengths.is an isometric view of one embodiment of the fastener  of the fastening system of the present invention. Flexible wings  can be seen on two walls of the shank . Preferably, each of the flexible wings are of equal length and each flexible wing intersects the shank so that the flexible wings are not attached to the shank in a spiral fashion. Each of the flexible wings may be arranged at an angle such that the terminating end of each wing points toward the cap surface . Preferably, no portion of any flexible wing extends outwardly from the shank beyond the maximum extent of the cap portion. The flexible wings are designed to interact with the walls of the aperture within the one or more substrate layers, wherein the radius of the aperture is smaller than any radius of the cap portion and smaller than any radius measured from a center on the shank to a termination point of a flexible wing. The radius from a center on the shank to a termination point of a flexible wing is preferably larger than that of a corresponding aperture to allow the flexible wings to flex against any substrate surface surrounding the aperture and to snap out behind any substrate surface surrounding the aperture, so that the push-pin fastener may remain immovably fixed within that aperture.The shape of the side walls that are disposed about the shank  may result in a narrow portion of the fastener and a wide portion of the fastener and corresponding narrow and wide portions of the aperture, especially if the fastener and corresponding aperture are trapezoidal in shape. When the fastener is used in combination with an aperture that embodies both a wide portion and a narrow portion the fastener may be inserted in only one direction, so that the narrow portion of the aperture corresponds with the narrow portion of the fastener. This ensures that the fastener is inserted in the direction that allows for the most secure fit. The embodiment including a trapezoidal fastener and corresponding aperture also allows for fastening to a substrate or multiple substrates with only one fastener, whereas multiple fasteners would generally be required to prevent pivoting of the substrate around a single fastener. When one side of the fastener and corresponding aperture is longer than an opposing parallel side, a substrate is stabilized and pivoting is prevented with only a single fastener.Preferably, the side walls of the fastener and corresponding aperture are both trapezoidal and isosceles in nature, so that the two non-parallel walls  of the fastener and aperture are of equal length and the base angles  are equal as well. In preferred embodiments, the two side walls of the fastener and aperture that are parallel exist in a ratio of 2:1 such that one side wall is about twice the length of the opposing side wall. Generally, that same ratio may range from about 1.5:1 to about 4:1.Turning now to , which is a cross-sectional view of the fastener . The shank  has a width measured between opposite corners . That width may be substantially equal to or smaller than the diameter of the corresponding aperture. In preferred embodiments, the height of the fastener as measured from the cap to the opposite end of the fastener is between about 5 mm to about 30 mm. More preferably, the height is between about 10 mm to about 20 mm. Most preferably, the height of the fastener is about 15 mm.The width of the cap at its widest point ranges from about 2 mm and about 30 mm. More preferably, the width of the cap at its widest point ranges from about 5 mm to about 12 mm and most preferably is about 10 mm. The length of the cap is between about 5 mm to about 30 mm. More preferably, the length is between about 5 mm to about 15 mm. Most preferably, the length of the cap is about 10 mm. In preferred embodiments, the ratio of the length of the shaft to the length of the cap may range from 4:1 to 1:1, or the length of the shaft may be less than the length of the cap. Preferably, the ratio of the length of the shaft to the length of the cap is from about 2:1 to about 1:1.The distance between each row of flexible wings  may be consistent or may vary from row to row. Preferably, the distance between two rows of flexible wings ranges from about 0.5 mm to about 3 mm. More preferably, the distance between two rows of wings ranges from about 1 mm to about 2 mm. The distance between the cap and the first row of flexible wings ranges from about 0.5 mm to about 3 mm. More preferably, the distance between the cap and the first row of flexible wings ranges from about 1 mm to about 2 mm. The distance between the rows of flexible wings may be consistent along the shank or may vary from row to row. The distance from the cap to a tip of one flexible wing as compared to the distance from the cap to the tip of a corresponding flexible wing on an adjacent or opposite wall may not be equidistant, resulting in a staggered positioning of the flexible wings about the fastener. In preferred embodiments, the angle between a row of flexible wings and the shaft ranges from about 10° to about 90°. More preferably, the angle ranges from about 45° to about 90°. Preferably, the flexible wings which pass completely through the aperture during insertion will be released from flexing and will reassume their position at the predetermined angle toward the cap surface on the underside of the surface surrounding the aperture.shows a view of the fastener from the end opposite the cap surface. Preferably, the end of the shank that first enters the aperture may also be trapezoidal in shape.The present fasteners may be injection molded from any of the polymeric resin, or any plastic or other materials commonly used for the manufacture of tree fasteners. A polyamide or any thermoplastic polymer that can be injection molded or possibly extruded may be used. Any molded thermoset material may also be used.Turning now to  which shows placement of the fastener within the corresponding aperture of a substrate shown here as an automotive baffle. Preferably, portions  of the flexible fins  lie beyond the outer edge of the aperture . This characteristic of the flexible fins provides the fastener with the ability to remain fixed within an aperture having an area smaller than that of the cross section of the widest point on the shank without rotating or rattling. The trapezoidal shape of the fastener further stabilizes the fastened part by preventing pivoting around the fastener.The flexible wings  are preferably included in sufficient number and spacing that a set of fins may be flexed inside the aperture to discourage slippage and disengagement. The substrate thickness and the distance  between one row of flexible wings and an adjacent row of flexible wings may allow for the substrate to fit in the space between two adjacent rows of flexible wings. Consequently, the spacing of the flexible wings results in a tight fit for substrates over a wide range of thicknesses.In preferred embodiments, the shank has a midsection that may be exposed at one wall, such that the shank may maintain flexibility. The shape of the shank is designed to keep the fastener centered within the aperture, thereby maximizing the contact made by the flexible wings with the substrate surface surrounding the aperture to reduce the likelihood of slippage, disengagement, or pivoting of a fastened part about the fastener.The insertion force, retention force and removal force of the fastener may be predetermined by varying its design parameters. The limitations which will determine the insertion force include the amount of flexibility imparted on the flexible wings, which is determined by the type and gauge of the material used to construct the flexible wings. Further, the angle at which the flexible wings are attached to the shank will affect the insertion force, a smaller angle requiring less force, a larger angle requiring more force. Several factors will increase the retention force. By selecting a thick-gauge sturdy material for the flexible wings, the retention force will increase, as the gauge and strength of the selected material increases. However, a material that is too thick or too strong may result in insertion or retention forces that are stronger than desired. Further, as the length of the flexible wings increases, the retention forces may increase as well. An increase in the angle at which the flexible wings are attached to the shank may result in additional increase in retention force.As can be seen in , the substrate layers may include one or more layers of a carrier material . The carrier is preferably configured to extend along an axis and includes at least a first end and a second end which reside on opposite ends of the axis. The carrier may also include one or more cavities which extend along the length or axis of the carrier. The carrier can be straight or contoured along its length.The carrier is formed of one or more walls that extend along the length of the carrier, which may be joined or otherwise integrated together. The carrier may have separate pieces that are separately made and then assembled together, it may be integrally formed, or both. Optionally, it is contemplated that the one or more of the walls may be internal walls located substantially within exterior walls of the carrier. Preferably, upon joining of the walls, the carrier forms one or more (or a plurality) of cavities (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more cavities) that extend along at least a portion of the length of the carrier and more preferably the entire length. It is contemplated that the one or more cavities may form openings extending through the carrier between the first and second ends of the carrier, thereby allowing the passage of fluids or other components through the carrier.Optionally, the carrier may include one or more through holes formed in the walls of the carrier. One or more of the through holes may be shaped as polygonal (e.g., trapezoidal) apertures for engaging one or more complimentary fasteners of the present invention. The through holes may provide reduced weight of the carrier. The through holes may also be used to directly control any flow of activatable substrate layers, or otherwise.The carrier may be formed of any of a variety of materials and can be formed of a single material or multiple materials. As examples, the carrier may be formed of polymeric materials (e.g., thermoplastics such as polyamide), metals (e.g., aluminum, steel, magnesium, metal alloys) combinations thereof or the like. As will be recognized, the technique for forming and shaping the carrier will typically depend upon the material of the carrier. Examples of techniques include, without limitation, molding (e.g., injection, compression or blow molded), stamping, hydroforming, extruding or otherwise. Examples of suitable materials and forming processes can be found in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,467,834, to Barz et al., the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes.In further reference to , one or more substrate layers may include a sealant or adhesive material  (or any material that acts as a sealant and adhesive) which may or may not be expandable. The sealant or adhesive material may comprise a non-activatable material, an activatable material or a combination of both. For example, the sealant or adhesive material may comprise a non-activatable material which undergoes little to no physical or chemical change upon application of energy. Alternatively, the sealant or adhesive material may comprise an activatable material which does undergo physical and/or chemical change upon application of energy, as described herein. Still further, it is further contemplated that only a portion of the sealant or adhesive material may be activatable.Preferably, the sealant or adhesive material comprises or includes an activatable material to cause sealing. More preferably, the sealant or adhesive material comprises a heat activatable material configured to expand upon application of energy (such as heat or otherwise). The thickness of the sealant or adhesive material may vary depending upon a number of factors such as whether and to what level the sealant or adhesive material is activatable or expandable. The thickness may also be dependent upon the volume of open space to be filled. Still further, the thickness may be based upon the pliability of the sealant or adhesive material. Examples of suitable thicknesses include between about 0.5 to 10 mm or between about 1 to 5 mm or otherwise.If the sealant or adhesive material is expandable, it may be formed of several different materials. Generally speaking, the member may utilize technology and processes for the forming and applying the expandable material such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,922,596; 4,978,562; 5,124,186; 5,884,960; 6,467,834; 6,482,486 and 7,199,165 all of which are expressly incorporated by reference for all purposes.The sealant or adhesive material may be generally dry to the touch or tacky and can be placed upon another substrate or within a vehicle cavity or the like in any form of desired pattern, placement, or thickness, but is preferably of substantially uniform thickness. Examples of other suitable tacky or non-tacky materials include L-2663, L-2610, L-2609, L-2701, L-2820, L-5520 or other similar material available through L&L Products, Inc. of Romeo, Mich.In applications where the adhesive or sealing material is a heat activated, thermally expanding material, an important consideration involved with the selection and formulation of the material comprising the structural foam is the temperature at which a material reaction or expansion, and possibly curing, will take place. For instance, in most applications, it is undesirable for the material to be reactive at room temperature or otherwise at the ambient temperature in a production line environment. More typically, the structural foam becomes reactive at higher processing temperatures, such as those encountered in an assembly plant, when the foam is processed along with the automobile components at elevated temperatures or at higher applied energy levels, e.g., during paint curing steps. While temperatures encountered in an automobile assembly operation may be in the range of about 130° C. to 205° C. (about 300° F. to 400° F.), body and paint shop applications are commonly about 93.33° C. (about 200° F.) or slightly higher. Similarly, during manufacturing of other transportation device (e.g., bicycle, motorcycles, all terrain vehicles or otherwise), higher temperatures may also be used during paint curing process (such as powder coat applications) or otherwise. In one configuration, the material becomes reactive at temperatures greater than about 120° C., or greater than about 150° C. or even greater than about 160° C. If needed, blowing agent activators can be incorporated into the composition to cause expansion at different temperatures outside the above ranges.By specific example, it is contemplated that the material may be cured in a powder coat paint cure operation. In such an operation, the material may be exposed to a temperature range between approximately 120°-230° C. with an exposure time between about 10 minutes to 60 minutes. Also, it is contemplated that the material may be cured in a precipitation hardening cure operation. In this operation, the material may be exposed to a temperature range between approximately 150°-230° C. with an exposure time between about 45 minutes to 8 hours.Generally, suitable expandable foams have a range of expansion ranging from approximately 0 to over 1000 percent. The level of expansion of the expandable material may be increased to as high as 2000 percent or more. Typically, strength and stiffness are obtained from products that possess lower expansion.Some other possible materials for the expandable material include, but are not limited to, polyolefin materials, copolymers and terpolymers with at least one monomer type an alpha-olefin, phenol/formaldehyde materials, phenoxy materials, and polyurethane. See also, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,266,133; 5,766,719; 5,755,486; 5,575,526; 5,932,680; and WO 00/27920 (PCT/US 99/24795) (all of which are expressly incorporated by reference).In another embodiment, the expandable material is provided in an encapsulated or partially encapsulated form, which may comprise a pellet, which includes an expandable foamable material, encapsulated or partially encapsulated in an adhesive shell. An example of one such system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,422,575 hereby incorporated by reference.The fastening system of the present invention may be used in place of any so-called tree fastener, so long as the corresponding aperture is of appropriate size and shape. Preferably, the fastening system of the present invention is suitable for substantial variation in substrate thicknesses while still providing secure fastening.The fastening system of the present invention may be used for attachment purposes within the automotive field, specifically as part of an automotive baffle, reinforcement or sealing material. Examples of these components are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,290,828; 7,249,415; 7,125,561; 7,105,112; 6,991,237; 6,953,219; 6,920,693; 6,890,021; 6,785,533; 6,620,501; and others. They can also be used in other applications where tree fasteners are currently used.In summary, the fastening system of the present invention has as advantages: a smooth installation; low insertion and high retention forces; the ability to effectively secure a wide range of substrate layers and corresponding substrate thicknesses; the ability to be customized to meet the specific needs of an application; the appropriate shape to ensure ideal insertion direction and to reduce the need for additional fasteners to prevent pivoting; ease in manufacture and tooling; low cost; self-centering; and consistency.Modifications to the present fasteners would be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art, but would not bring the fastener so modified beyond the scope of the claims to follow. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the present invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.The explanations and illustrations presented herein are intended to acquaint others skilled in the art with the invention, its principles, and its practical application. Those skilled in the art may adapt and apply the invention in its numerous forms, as may be best suited to the requirements of a particular use. Accordingly, the specific embodiments of the present invention as set forth are not intended as being exhaustive or limiting of the invention. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined not with reference to the above description, but should instead be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. The disclosures of all articles and references, including patent applications and publications, are incorporated by reference for all purposes. Other combinations are also possible as will be gleaned from the following claims, which are also hereby incorporated by reference into this written description."

                "This application is based upon German Patent Application No. 10 2010 017 739.3-24, filed on Jul. 5, 2010, the entire contents of which is being incorporated by reference herein.The present invention relates to a threaded element, a screw with a threaded element, an installation method for a threaded element in an opening of a component, and a component with an installed threaded element.Threaded elements, which are also known as wire thread inserts, are generally known in the prior art. Threaded elements are made of different materials that vary depending on the respective application area. In addition, the threaded elements vary in their shape in order to support different varieties of installation.There are two typical types of mounting for inserting the threaded element into an opening of a component that does or does not have receiving threads. With the one type of mounting, the helical wire of the threaded element has a driving notch. Using this driving notch, an installation tool drags the threaded element along and screws it into the receiving thread of the opening of the component. Examples of this are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,563,119, U.S. Pat. No. 4,645,398 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,553,303. With the other type of mounting, one end of the threaded element has a diagonally progressing driver pin. The installation tool engages at this driver pin in order to drag the threaded element along and thereby screw it into the threads of the opening. This is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 2,152,681, and U.S. Pat. No. 2,363,663. EP 1 897 659 on the other hand, describes a special installation spindle for installing threaded elements.Threaded elements additionally have smaller windings with respect to their inner diameter which serve as a so-called screw-lock. For this purpose, U.S. Pat. No. 6,421,899 discloses one or more windings, which are formed as hexagons that are displaced radially inward within the threaded element. These screw-locks hold the screwed-in screws by means of a frictional connection, for example, in order to support a preassembled state.The object of the present invention is to provide a threaded element that due to its design supports and simplifies the installation in a component compared to prior art. Similarly, a corresponding installation method is to be provided for threaded elements that are so designed.The objective above is solved by a threaded element, a screw with the threaded element, an installation method for the threaded element, and by a component with the threaded element according to the following claims. Advantageous designs, preferred embodiments and further developments of the present invention arise from the description, the claims and the attached drawings.The inventive threaded element in the shape of a wire thread insert has the following features: a) a plurality of sequential helical windings, whose radial interior, preferably also its radial exterior, is adapted in its shape to a thread, in which b) at least one narrowed helical winding consists of at least two helical winding sections which encompass one or a plurality of sequential secants that constrict the narrowed helical winding radial inwards.The inventive threaded element has this specific shape in order to be installed together with a screw or an installation spindle into an opening of a component in an advantageous manner. As soon as the threaded element has been preassembled onto the screw or the installation spindle or generally onto an installation tool, the narrowed helical winding is pressed radially outward by the screw, for example. This radial outward pressing of the narrowed helical winding of the threaded element causes at least one part of the narrowed helical winding to extend radially outward beyond the outer diameter of the remaining threaded element. Due to this radially outward directed projection, while turning the screw with the threaded element into an opening of a component, a certain increased torque is required in comparison to the preceding part of the screw with the threaded element. If this increase of the torque is detected during the installation of the screw with the threaded element, it can be monitored in this manner up to the position where the threaded element has already having been turned in or screwed into the opening of the component.In order to attain a reliable increase of the installation torque during the installation of the threaded element, the threaded element preferably comprises at least one narrowed helical winding having at least three helical winding sections, in which at least at two locations enclose one or a plurality of sequential secants. Preferably, there are also at least two narrowed helical windings that are disposed apart from each other in the longitudinal direction of the threaded element. This specific embodiment guarantees that two or more increases can be detected during the capturing of the installation torque of the screw with threaded element, in order to make different installation positions of the threaded element in the opening of the component visible for the worker.According to a further embodiment, one of the narrowed helical windings is disposed within the last one to four helical windings with respect to the thread direction of the threaded element. According to a further embodiment, one narrowed helical winding is disposed in a middle region relative to a length of the threaded element.According to the invention, a further threaded element is proposed that even without a screw or installation spindle guarantees the same function as with the threaded element described above. This threaded element in the shape of a wire thread insert has the following features: a plurality of sequential helical windings whose radial interior, preferably also its radial exterior, is adapted in its shape to a thread, in which b) at least one widened helical winding is composed of at least two helical winding sections that enclose one or a plurality of sequential bulges, which expand the widened helical winding radially outwards.Compared to the threaded element described above with the narrowed helical winding, the narrowed helical windings are replaced by widened helical windings. Instead of secants, these widened helical windings use one or a plurality of radial outward directed bulges that project beyond the outer diameter of the remaining threaded element. In this manner, the widened helical windings already create an increase of the installation torque as soon as they are screwed into the opening of the component. From this, it follows that an increase of the installation torque of the threaded element can also be generated without a preinstalled screw or installation spindle.In a preferred design of this threaded element with widened helical winding, the at least one widened helical winding comprises at least three helical winding sections which enclose one or a plurality of sequential bulges at least two locations. In addition, there are preferably at least two widened helical windings in the threaded element that are disposed spaced from each other in the longitudinal direction of the threaded element. In a further preferred design, additionally one of the widened helical windings is disposed within the last one to four helical windings relative to the thread direction of the threaded element, whereas a further widened helical winding is preferably disposed in the middle region with respect to a length of the threaded element.Furthermore, the present invention discloses an installation method for a screw with threaded element, or an installation spindle with threaded element, or an installation tool with a threaded element, into an opening with an internal thread of a component, where a pitch per rotation of the internal thread is known. This installation method has the following steps; a) screwing the screw with threaded element, the installation spindle with threaded element, or the installation tool with threaded element into the internal thread of the opening of the component, b) capturing a screw-in torque and an angle of rotation of the threaded element during the screwing in, c) determining a position of the threaded element in the opening from a first covered angle of rotation after a first increase of the screw-in torque from a base screw-in torque to a first screw-in torque, which signals an entry of the narrowed helical winding of the threaded element or the widened helical winding of the threaded element in the opening, and the pitch of the thread.The inventive installation method is based on the fact that both the angle of rotation as well as the screw-in torque are captured during installation of the threaded element. Using the capture of the screw-in torque, it can be determined when the narrowed helical winding sitting on the screw or the installation spindle, or when the widened helical winding, is rotated into the opening of the component, because the screw-in torque increases in the process. During the installation process it is possible to reliably recognize when this specific region of the threaded element enters into the opening of the component because due to the shape of the threaded element the increase of the screw-in torque can be defined adjustably. If after this increase of the screw-in torque, the angle of rotation covered by the threaded element is captured, then it is known how far the threaded element has already been installed into the opening of the component. The position of the threaded element results from the product of the angle of rotation and the pitch of the internal thread of the opening of the component.For the further design of the installation method, it is preferred to define a maximum torque and to terminate the screwing-in of the threaded element upon attaining the maximum torque. In this context, the maximum torque, or an appropriate torque threshold to be defined for this purpose, serve to capture a contact of the threaded element with a bottom of the opening of the component, for example. In the same way, it is possible in this manner to detect that the head of the screw with the threaded element rests on, or runs up against, the component.If the threaded element with a screw has a plurality of narrowed helical windings, or the threaded element has a plurality of widened helical windings, it is preferable to capture a second increase of the screw-in torque, which signals an entry of a further narrowed or widened helical winding of the threaded element into the opening of the component, in order to determine, on this basis, the position of the threaded element in the opening of the component.In addition, the present invention comprises a component having an opening with an internal thread and a threaded element or a threaded element with the screw installed therein. In order to support the installation of the threaded element in the opening of the component, it is preferred to provide a cylindrical insertion surface without internal thread at the entry of the opening. This cylindrical insertion surface facilitates the initial contact and alignment of the threaded element with respect to the opening, and facilitates the subsequent screwing-in.In addition, the present invention comprises a winding spindle for producing a threaded element from a wire. The winding spindle has the following features: a fastening head using which the winding spindle can be fastened, and a threaded section which has at least one recess in the shape of a secant or an elevation in the shape of a bulge. The threaded section of the winding spindle comprises a plurality of thread turns. Preferably, a recess or an elevation, or a plurality of abutting recesses or elevations, are disposed within a thread turn of the threaded section. It is further preferred to dispose a plurality of individual recesses or elevations, or repeatedly a plurality of recesses or elevations distributed in an axial direction along the threaded section. According to another embodiment, the at least one recess or elevation, or plurality of recesses or elevations, is enclosed by two spindle thread sections.The present invention additionally discloses a manufacturing method for a threaded element, in particular a threaded element as already described, that has the following steps: arranging the wire to be wound on a winding spindle with at least one recess or elevation in a thread section, preferably a winding spindle according to the prior description, rotating the winding spindle so that the wire to be wound is wound up on the winding spindle, and the at least one recess or elevation in the thread section forms at least a secant or a bulge, and separating the wire to be wound from the wire wound on the winding spindle, so that a threaded element is present, and unwinding the threaded element from the winding spindle.The inventive threaded element ; ′ has the shape of a wire helix, which is implemented as a spiral spring. The wire helix is composed of a plurality of adjacent helical windings . The helical windings  and thus, the entire threaded element ; ′ have an internal diameter and an external diameter, DA. In addition, the threaded element ; ′ has a specific length L depending on the use case.The helical windings  preferably have a cross-section in the shape of a diamond. As a result, a shape adapted to a thread is given at both the radial interior and exterior of the helical windings . It is also preferred that only the radial interior of the threaded element ; ′ provides a thread shape. In this case, the radial exterior of the threaded element ; ′ is designed arbitrarily and implements an anchoring or material displacing function in the material of a component B, for example.The wire helix is preferably composed of a spring steel or another elastic material of high strength.The threaded element ; ′ of the present invention due to its specific shape, requires during its screwing-in or installation in an opening  of the component B, at least a first screw-in torque M after a base screw-in torque M. Because during the installation of the threaded element ; ′, its angle of rotation is also captured, the position of the threaded element , ′ in the opening  of the component B can be determined from the torque progression and the angle of rotation. This allows reliable process monitoring and quality assurance during the installation already through the use of a standard screwing tool with capture and evaluation of the torque and angle of rotation. For this purpose, the threaded element  according to  has at least one narrowed helical winding .  shows a top view of the narrowed helical winding  from .The narrowed helical winding  comprises at least two helical winding sections , . The winding sections ,  enclose a secant  which narrows the otherwise circular helical winding  radially inward (see ). It is also preferred, instead of only one secant , to string together a plurality of secants  between the winding sections , , as shown in FIG. C. According to a further embodiment, two or more individual (see ) or two or more pluralities of secants  (not shown) are spaced from each other by helical winding sections , . It is also preferable to arrange more than two separate secants  or secant groups in the narrowed helical winding .shows the threaded element  with a specific length L. Preferably, at least one narrowed helical winding  is disposed in the middle region relative to the length L of the threaded element . In addition to this, it is advantageous to dispose a further narrowed helical winding  at a distance to the middle region of the threaded element . According to a preferred embodiment, one of the narrowed helical windings  is disposed within the last one to four helical windings  with respect to the thread direction G of the threaded element . The advantage of this construction is explained later in conjunction with the installation method of the threaded element .According to a further optional design, the threaded element  has a plurality of sequential helical windings , as are shown, for example, in . This plurality of helical windings  preferably comprises two to five windings . These are disposed at the start of the threaded element  as seen in its thread direction G. The helical windings  have a smaller diameter than the outer diameter DA of the threaded element . In this manner, the windings  are in a position to produce a greater frictional connection to a screw S, an installation spindle  or another installation tool, for example, than the remaining helical windings  of the threaded element  with the outer diameter DA. Due to this increased frictional connection, the installation of the threaded element  in the component B is supported, because the threaded element  is better retained on the screw S, the installation spindle , or another installation tool. Whereas already one individual of the windings  would be sufficient to fasten the threaded element  on the screw S, for example, through at least one additional winding  the retention of the threaded element  is additionally supported on the screw S. The background for this is that during screwing-in the screw S with threaded element  into an opening  of the component B, the first winding  can encounter resistance. Such resistance is, for example, a burr or contamination in the internal thread  of the opening . Due to this resistance, the first winding  is blocked and partially widened during screwing into the opening . Thereby, the frictional connection between the screw S and the first winding  is reduced. However, because at least one further winding  is provided in the threaded element , this secures a reliable retention of the threaded element  on the screw S. Preferably, the at least one further winding  is disposed directly adjacent to the first winding . It is also preferred to dispose the at least one further winding  with several windings apart from the first winding  (not shown). In the same manner, it is preferred to provide subsequent groups of windings  spaced from each other. When one or more groups can be used, these contain one to five windings . Using this arrangement of the windings  guarantees that due to the force fit connection between the screw S and the threaded element , the friction between the internal thread  and the threaded element  determines the screw-in torque of the screw S. The threaded element  cannot be loosened and/or blocked due to a resistance in the internal thread , so that only the friction between screw S and threaded element  determines the measurable screw-in torque (see below). This guarantees a reliable installation of the threaded element  into component B.The threaded element  according to  is installed using a screw S (see ), an installation spindle  (see ), or a similar installation tool, into the opening  of the component B. After screwing the threaded element  onto the screw S, the narrowed helical winding  is pressed radially outward by the screw S. In this state, the narrowed helical winding  extends beyond the outer diameter DA of the threaded element . This radially outward directed projection depends on the number and dimension of the secants . The increase of a screw-in torque M during the entry of the narrowed helical winding  into the internal thread  of the component B can be purposefully adjusted depending on the dimensioning of the projection.If the screw S with the threaded element  is now screwed in the thread direction G into the opening  of the component B, the first helical windings  to  require a base screw-in torque M. The screw-in torque M increases to a first screw-in torque M as soon as the narrowed helical winding  with the radially outward directed projection enters in the internal thread  of the opening . Correspondingly, the screw-in torque M changes further in a defined manner when further narrowed helical windings  with radially outward directed projections arrive in the internal thread  of the opening .shows an alternate design of a threaded element V. This threaded element ′ does not need to be installed with a screw S or an installation spindle  into the component B. Despite this, due to its design it yields same change of the screw-in torque during the installation as with the threaded element  (see above).The threaded elements  and ′ of  differ only in that the threaded element ′ used a widened helical winding  instead of the narrowed helical winding . Whereas the helical winding sections ,  correspond in shape, arrangement and number to the different embodiments of the helical winding sections , , the at least one secant  is replaced by at least one bulge . The bulge  extends radially outward beyond the outer diameter DA of the threaded element V. This radially outward directed projection is created either by one or a plurality of combined bulges , or by several separate bulges , or groups of bulges . As already mentioned above, the bulges  and the widened helical windings  are disposed in the same manner as the secants  and the narrowed helical windings  (see , B, C), even if this is not shown. In the same manner, the threaded element ′ preferably also comprises the windings  tapered in comparison to the outer diameter DA. These in turn, serve to support the fixing of the threaded element ′ at an installation tool by an increased frictional connection in comparison to the prior art.If the threaded element ′ is screwed into the internal thread  of the opening  of the component B, the at least one widened helical winding  creates the same effect as the narrowed helical winding  after preinstallation on the screw S. Therefore, for further information, see the explanation above for the threaded element .For supporting the installation of the threaded elements ; ′, they each preferably have a driving notch  or a driving pin  in the first winding  as viewed in the thread direction G, as shown in the .The threaded elements ; ′ are installed in the opening  of the component B. The opening  comprises the internal thread  that is to be reinforced by the threaded element ; ′. The opening  at its entrance preferably has a cylindrical insertion surface  without internal threads . Using the insertion surface , the threaded element , ′ can be initially aligned with respect to the opening . In addition to this, the insertion surface  supports the entry of the threaded element ; ′ because a starting canting of the threaded element ; ′ in the opening  is avoided.The installation method of the threaded element ; ′ in the component B is described using , the screw-in torque-angle of rotation diagram in  and the flow diagram in . The threaded element  is installed in the component B with the screw S as an example for the two threaded elements ; ′. The threaded elements ; ′ could be assembled into the internal thread  of the opening  in the same manner using an installation spindle , or a known installation tool.Different stages of the installation are shown in , , . For improved clarity, in each case the screw S with which the threaded element  is installed, is not shown. Because the screw S is not shown, the position of the secants  of the narrowed helical winding  can be recognized with respect to the internal thread .In , a part of the threaded element  has entered in the internal thread , however, the secant  has not yet entered. In , the secant  has just been received by the internal thread , and in , threaded element  is completely installed in the opening  of the component B.In step S of the installation method, initially the threaded element  is screwed into the internal threads,  without a narrowed helical winding  already been screwed in. Due to the friction between the internal thread  and the threaded element , a base screw-in torque M is required in order implement this screw-in according to . The first phase I is identified in . It requires an example base screw-in torque M of 0.4 Nm over an angle of rotation a of 4.800°.As can be seen in the diagram in , during the screw-in procedure or during the installation method, both the screw-in torque M and the angle of rotation α are captured online and evaluated. This is feasible using a standard electric screwdriver. With such electric screwdrivers, immediate access to the screw-in torque and angle of rotation realized by the electric screwdriver is possible via a connection to a control and evaluation unit.In a second phase II, the secant  is screwed into the internal thread . Because the secant  creates a radially outward enlargement of the winding  on the screw S, the screw-in torque M increases during entry of the secant  in the internal thread . As soon as the secant  is completely entered in the internal thread , a plateau is reached in the screw-in torque—angle of rotation curve. In this phase II, therefore the screw-in torque M increases from the base screw-in torque M to a first screw-in torque M at the level of the plateau of the screw-in torque—angle of rotation curve. This state is shown inThis first screw-in torque M could also be captured when a widened helical winding  of the threaded element ′ would enter in the internal thread .The pitch of the internal thread  of the component B is known. The thread height indicates the path that the screw must travel during a complete rotation within the internal thread . If the pitch of the internal thread  is multiplied by the captured angle of rotation a after its division by 360°, the distance that the threaded element  traveled into the opening  is obtained. In addition, the position at which the winding  with secant  is disposed relative to the length L of the threaded element  is known. The attainment of the first screw-in torque M at a specific angle of rotation α at the end of phase II therefore offers the possibility to check whether the threaded element  has been entered correctly in the internal thread , and what position it has attained. At the end of phase II (see ), the product of the pitch of the internal thread  and the quotient of the angle of rotation α divided by 360° must equate to the position of the winding  relative to the length L of the threaded element .If the screw-in procedure continues, and no further winding  is entered into the internal thread , the screw-in torque M remains at the plateau value of the first screw-in torque M. If a further winding  were to be entered in the internal thread , a further increase of the screw-in torque M up to a second screw-in torque M, analogously to phase II, would be captured (step , not shown). This further increase of the screw-in torque M and the subsequent plateau value at a specific angle of rotation a can be used again for the purpose of determining and checking the position of the threaded element  in the opening .If the threaded element ; ′ is completely installed, the threaded element ; ′ contacts, for example, the bottom of the opening , or the head of the screw S rests on the surface of the component B. At this moment, the screw-in torque M increases steeply (phase IV) and exceeds a previously defined maximum screw-in torque threshold value. Upon exceeding the torque threshold value, the installation procedure according to a preferred embodiment is automatically terminated. Furthermore, it is preferable at this point to again calculate the position of the threaded element within the opening  using the angle of rotation a, in order to confirm the end of the installation.According to the described installation procedure, the screw-in torque M and the angle of rotation α are preferably continuously captured during the screwing-in or in general during the installation of the threaded element ; ′, into the opening  of the component B. On this basis, it is preferred to define a process window P in order to make the installation of the threaded element ; ′ easier for the worker. The process window P is illustrated as an example in .The process window P is defined at least by a minimum angle of rotation αP and a minimum screw-in torque MP. It is additionally preferred to further define a maximum angle of rotation αP and a maximum screw-in torque MP. These four values αP, MP, αP and MP, to be determined by the worker before the installation of the threaded element ; ′, span the process window P shown in .If the electrical screwdriver, or a control connected to it, used during the installation method, captures that the minimal limits αP and MP of the process window P were exceeded, than this is captured as the attainment of the minimum installation target. On this basis, according to one embodiment, the installation result of the threaded element ; ′ is rated as “OK”.It is further preferred that the process window P is dimensioned and disposed in the screw-in torque-angle of rotation space so that the screw-in torque M attains the plateau value of phase III within the process window P. This plateau value signals the entry of the last narrowed helical winding , or the last widened helical winding , as seen in the thread direction G, in the internal thread  of the opening , with a specific angle of rotation α, as was described above in detail. In this context, it is preferred to dimension the process window P so that the plateau value, or phase III, lies completely within the process window P. Thus, if the attainment of the plateau value of the screw-in torque of phase III is captured within the process window P, the installation can on this basis preferably be rated likewise as “OK”, because the last winding ;  is completely integrated within the internal thread . If the plateau value of phase III is not attained within the process window P, or if the plateau value continues outside of the process window P at higher values of the angle of rotation than the maximum angle of rotation limit αP, the installation is rated as “not OK”.According to a further preferred design of the installation method, the screw-in torque M is to exceed the defined maximum threshold value (see above) before the maximum angle of rotation limit αP is attained—thus, within the process window P. If this is the case, the installation process is rated as “OK”, and automatically ended. If the maximum threshold value of the screw-in torque is not exceeded, the threaded element ; ′ has not yet attained its final position, and therefore, the installation cannot be rated as “OK”. The installation is preferably continued or canceled, or the worker is signaled that the installation method is leaving the process window P. In this case, the worker could monitor the further installation method instead of the automatic control.It is likewise preferred that instead of an automatic completion of the installation method by the control, that the completion of the installation procedure is signaled to the worker so that the worker ends the installation method.If the plateau value of the screw-in torque of phase III or the maximum threshold value of the screw-in torque is not attained within the process window, the installation is rated as “not OK”, and automatically canceled or a cancellation is signaled.It is understood that the above conditions can be used individually or in any arbitrary combination. Is also preferred to dimension the process window P shown in  differently, and to dispose it differently in the screw-in torque-angle of rotation space differently. Thus, for example, the limits of the process window P can be moved so that along with the phases II, III, IV also a part of phase I of the screw-in torque-angle of rotation curve is contained in the process window.The present invention additionally discloses a winding spindle  as is seen in  according to a preferred embodiment. The winding spindle  comprises a fastening head, by means of which the winding spindle  can be fastened. This fastening head is connected to a motor or a drive section, for example, such that the rotary movement of the motor or the drive section can be transferred to the winding spindle.Furthermore, the winding spindle  comprises a thread section . The thread section  is formed by a plurality of spindle thread turns . According to a preferred embodiment, at least one spindle thread turn  comprises a recess  in the shape of a secant or an elevation (not shown) in the shape of a bulge, as are formed later into the threaded element ; ′. In the same manner, the thread turn preferably has a plurality of adjacent recesses  or bulges (not shown). It is also preferred that several spindle thread turns  each have a recess  or bulge or a plurality of recesses  or bulges, distributed over the length of the thread section .The winding spindle  serves to wind a wire  on the winding spindle , specifically the thread section , in order to produce a threaded element ; ′. Therefore, if the wire  is wound on the thread section , on the one hand, it takes on the shape of the thread section  in order to form a wire helix. Furthermore, the wire  to be wound is formed complementary to the recesses  or bulges (not shown) that are present. Threaded elements , ′ are produced corresponding to the  and the description above, based on the number and arrangement of the recesses  or bulges (not shown). Even if it is not described in detail or shown, the thread section  can be formed complementary to the different preferred threaded elements , ′ (see above), in order to be able to produce these using the winding spindle .The thread section  has in addition a thread direction R, indicated by the arrow in . While winding the wire  onto the winding spindle , during the rotation of the winding spindle , the winding spindle  is moved either counter to the thread direction R. Or during the rotation of the spindle , the wire  moves in its perpendicular alignment to the longitudinal axis of the winding spindle  in thread direction R. Naturally, it is also preferred during the winding of the wire  onto the winding spindle  to simultaneously move the winding spindle  counter to the thread direction R, and the wire  in the thread direction R.Beyond this, the present invention discloses a production method for a threaded element ; ′, as was described above. This production method preferably has the steps according to the flow diagram in . For producing the threaded element ; ′, the winding spindle , already described above, is preferably used according to , upon which a wire  to be wound is wound. In step W, first, a suitably formed winding spindle , corresponding to the desired shape of the threaded element ; ′ to be produced, and an appropriate wire  are selected and prepared. Specifically, the winding spindle  preferably has a varying number and distribution of the recesses  or bulges. In addition, the thread shape of the thread section  can vary, which provides the later shape of the threaded element ; ′.In the next step, W, the end of the wire  to be wound (see ) is placed on a first end  of the thread section  of the winding spindle . It is also conceivable to place that end of the wire  to be wound on the end  of the thread section  in order to be able to subsequently wind it on the thread section . After the placement in step W, the wire  is pressed in the first spindle thread turn  near the end  of the thread section . This force action guarantees that during the subsequent rotation of the winding spindle , the wire  is forced into the spindle thread turns  of the thread section . In this way, the wound up wire  takes on the shape of the thread section , which is given by the individual spindle thread turns  with or without recesses  or bulges (not shown).For winding the wire  on the thread section , the wire  is aligned perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the winding spindle  (see ). During the winding of the wire  on the thread section , the winding spindle  rotates about its longitudinal axis. At the same time, the winding spindle  is preferably moved counter to its thread direction R, in order to wind the wire  on the thread section . In the same manner, it is preferred to move the wire  in the thread direction R while the wire  is wound onto the thread section . According to a further preferred embodiment, it is preferred to simultaneously move the winding spindle  counter to the thread direction R, while the wire  is moved in the thread direction R.During the winding of the wire  onto the thread section , the shape of the individual spindle thread turns  is impressed into the wire . Thereby, due to the at least one recess  a secant , or due to the elevation (not shown) the bulge  is created in the wire helix of the threaded element ; ′ in number and distribution corresponding to the recesses  and elevations on the thread section .After the wire  has been wound on the thread section , the wire helix, which later forms the threaded element ; ′, is located on the thread section . Now in step W, the wire  projecting perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the winding spindle  is separated in order to form the threaded element ; V. The separation can be realized using cutting, punching, shearing or breaking, for example at a previously imprinted intended break point of the wire . The separation in step W preferably occurs at the end  of the thread section .Following subsequently in step W, threaded element ; ′ is preferably unwound from the thread section  or the winding spindle . The produced threaded element ; ′ is optionally supplied to known post-processing steps corresponding to different production methods.The next production of a threaded element ; ′ can occur as soon as the winding spindle  is returned again into its starting position."

It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit the concepts of the present disclosure to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.Referring to , an orthopaedic prosthesis is illustratively embodied as a femoral orthopaedic implant  of a hip prosthesis. The femoral orthopaedic implant  includes a femoral neck component  and a stem component  that are configured to be implanted into a patient's femur. The femoral neck component  has a body  extending from a distal end  to a proximal end . The body  of the femoral neck component  includes an aperture  formed in the proximal end  and an aperture  formed in the distal end . The apertures ,  are connected via a hollow bore  extending therethrough. As shown in , the hollow bore  has a smaller diameter than the apertures , .A neck  extends away from the proximal end  of the body  to a threaded end . The threaded end  of the neck  receives a ball or head component (not shown) configured to engage with the patient's natural acetabulum or a prosthetic acetabular cup implanted into the patient's pelvic bone. It should be appreciated that in other embodiments the neck  may be configured to be press fit, taper fit, or secured by other fastening means to the head component.The stem component  includes a rod  extending from a tapered proximal end  to a distal end . As shown in , the stem component  is substantially-straight and has a pointed tip  formed at the distal end . It will be appreciated that in other embodiments the stem component  may have a different configuration to fit the needs of a given patient's anatomy. For example, the stem component  may be bowed or have a larger or smaller outer diameter. Similarly, the stem component  may be longer or shorter depending on the length of the patient's natural femur.When assembled as shown in , the proximal end  of the stem component  is received in the aperture  of the neck component . The neck component  is secured to the stem component  via a threaded fastener, which is embodied as a bolt . The bolt  includes a shaft  extending from a bolt head  to an externally threaded end . As shown in , the shaft  extends through a hollow sleeve  positioned within the body  of the neck component  and a lock washer  positioned between the sleeve  and the bolt head . It will be appreciated that in other embodiments the washer  may be a flat washer or a Belleville washer. The sleeve  includes a cylindrical end , which is positioned in the hollow bore , and a flange , which is placed in contact with the base  of the aperture .When fully assembled, the bolt head  is positioned in the aperture  of the neck component . As shown in , the bolt head  includes a hex-shaped socket  configured to receive a tool having a matching hexagonal cross-section. It will be appreciated that in other embodiments socket  may be a double hex-shaped socket, a square-shaped socket, or other suitable socket cross-section. As shown in , the externally threaded end  of the bolt  is received in an internally threaded aperture  formed in the proximal end  of the stem component .It will be appreciated that in other embodiments the neck component  may be secured to the stem component  using other threaded fasteners. For example, the stem component  may include an externally-threaded proximal end that extends through the hollow bore . In such embodiments, a nut positioned in the aperture  would be threaded onto the stem component  such that the stem component  is secured to the neck component .Referring now to , a simplified block diagram illustrates a process  for assembling the femoral orthopaedic implant . In step , a surgeon or other medical professional selects the neck component  and the stem component  appropriate for the patient's anatomy. The surgeon inserts the tapered proximal end  of the stem component  into the aperture  of the neck component  until the outer surface  of the rod  contacts the inner surface  of the aperture .In step , the sleeve  is inserted into the hollow bore  of the neck component . The lock washer  is positioned over the bolt shaft  and placed in contact with the bolt head . The threaded end  of the shaft  is then inserted into the aperture  and moved through the hollow sleeve  into the bore . When the threaded end  is placed in contact with the threaded aperture  of the stem component , the surgeon threads the bolt  into the stem component  by rotating the bolt  about the axis . The surgeon continues to turn the bolt , thereby threading the bolt  into the stem component  until the bolt head  is snug against the base  of the aperture .In step , the surgeon selects a torque wrench with a hex-head corresponding to the hex socket . One example of a torque wrench is the TORQOMETER, U.S./Newton Meter Basic 8.4 Newton-meter (75 inch-pound) torque wrench, Stock No. TER6A, which is commercially available from Snap-on Incorporated of Kenosha, Wis., U.S.A. After engaging the hex-head of the torque wrench with the socket , the surgeon uses the torque wrench to rotate the bolt , thereby tightening the bolt  and applying a clamp load to the neck component  and the stem component . Using the dial indicator of the torque wrench to determine the amount of torque applied, the surgeon rotates the bolt  until an empirically-determined starting torque is applied. The term “empirically-determined starting torque” is defined as the minimum amount of torque required to create a clamp load within a range of clamp loads having a linear relationship with the bolt head rotation angle. As will be described in greater detail below, the empirically-determined starting torque is approximately five Newton-meters in the illustrative embodiment. When the empirically-determined starting torque is applied, the bolt  is rotated about the axis  by an angle a, as shown in . In the illustrative embodiment, the angle a is approximately forty degrees.In step , the surgeon selects a torque angle gauge with a hex-head corresponding to the hex socket . One example of a torque angle gauge is the Torque Angle Gauge, Stock No. TA360, which is commercially available from Snap-on Incorporated of Kenosha, Wis., U.S.A. After engaging the hex-head of the torque angle gauge with the socket , the surgeon uses the torque angle gauge to rotate the bolt  by an empirically-determined rotation angle, which is illustrated in  as an angle B. The “empirically-determined rotation angle” is defined as the rotation angle of the threaded fastener required to increase the applied clamp load to a target predetermined clamp load. The target predetermined clamp load is set by the orthopaedic prosthesis manufacturer and is based on the operational requirements of the orthopaedic prosthesis. In the illustrative embodiment, the target predetermined clamp load is within the range of clamp loads having a linear relationship with the rotation angle of the bolt.Referring now to , a graph is illustrated showing the relationship between the clamp load, the applied torque, and the fastener rotation angle. A line  illustrates the relationship between the torque applied to the bolt  and the rotation angle. A line  illustrates the relationship between the clamp load and the rotation angle of the bolt . As discussed above, applying the empirically-determined starting torque in step  creates an initial predetermined clamp load . The initial predetermined clamp load  is within a range of clamp loads  having a linear relationship between clamp load and rotation angle of the bolt. In that way, when the bolt is further rotated about the axis , the clamp load increases linearly as the bolt is rotated. The initial predetermined clamp load  is also within a range of clamp loads  where the amount of torque applied to the bolt is proportional to the clamp load. As shown in , the torque applied becomes more volatile beyond the range of clamp loads .In the illustrative embodiment, the initial predetermined clamp load  is between 1.5 and 2.0 kilo-Newtons. When the surgeon rotates the bolt  by the empirically-determined rotation angle β in step , the target predetermined clamp load  is created between the neck component  and the stem component .The assembly method set forth above employs a torque wrench and an angle gauge. It will be appreciate that in other embodiments a single wrench may be used to carry out both steps. One example of such a wrench is the TECHANGLE Torque Wrench, Stock No. ATECH3FR250, which is commercially available from Snap-on Incorporated of Kenosha, Wis., U.S.A.While the assembly method set forth above has been described in relation to a femoral neck implant, it will be appreciated that the assembly method may be used with other orthopaedic prostheses. For example, a surgeon may use a similar assembly method to assemble the components of a tibial orthopaedic implant, a shoulder orthopaedic implant, or any other implant utilized in replacement procedures at other joint locations throughout the body.While the disclosure has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, such an illustration and description is to be considered as exemplary and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only illustrative embodiments have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the disclosure are desired to be protected.There are a plurality of advantages of the present disclosure arising from the various features of the systems and methods described herein.

                "This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/361,200 filed Jul. 2, 2011, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.This application includes material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.The present invention relates in general to the field of embedment of passive components in printed circuit boards, and in particular to a method for fabricating multi-layer circuit boards with embedded passive components.Embedding passive components into circuit boards was developed as a way to decrease electronic size and improve performance. Circuit boards with embedded passive components optimize layout in all three dimensions, allowing more efficient use along the thickness of the board to decrease volume. Improved performance comes by way of shorter and more electromagnetic interference isolated connections between components. In addition to decreased size and increased performance, embedded passives decrease assembly steps required to connect components to the surface of the card and thus cost.One customary practice for designing embedded passive components involves utilizing published embedded material properties. For example, sheet resistance may be given as 25 ohms per square (ohms/sq) while capacitance may be given as 1 nanofarad per square centimeter. These material specifications are commonly accompanied by upper and lower quality control limits, giving 25 ohms/sq a plus five percent and minus five percent variation, as an example. With this information, designs for embedded passives are set by defining the geometry such as the length and width of the material. Component length, width, and sheet resistance define resistance for an embedded resistor. That is to say, the resistance is the product of the sheet resistance and the ratio of length to width.With lengths and widths defined, embedded component manufacturers are able to start the construction of a circuit board. Typically, a circuit board will have a structural dielectric base with a thin conductive copper foil attached. A circuit card with embedded components may also include a coating of electrodeposited metal such as nickel alloy on the conductive copper which would reside between the copper and base dielectric layers. Embedded components are formed as printed wires or traces by selectively etching the thin metal foil. For embedded components, that may include both metal layers of copper and nickel alloys. A multi-layer board is created by laminating this construction to other base dielectric layers with copper foil attached and bonded by way of heat and pressure and prepreg glue. Access of surface mounted components to embedded ones is by way of vias which are conductive barrels inserted into holes drilled through the various board layers. Vias attach conductive surface patches to embedded ones such as those from an embedded resistor.The manufactured embedded passive board assembly is verified by measuring with a meter between vias exposed to the surface of the board and attached to embedded components. Utilizing the conventional manufacturing process described, the resistors in this example would not fall within the specified five percent control limits. This is primarily for two reasons; one, the way in which the material control limits are specified by the manufacturer; and two, the variations associated with the board manufacturing process.In response to the two sources of undesirable process control, board manufacturers employ a corrective mechanical or laser trimming procedure accompanied by computer aided design geometry correction factors and quality control test points. Quality control test points are utilized as a means of further refining the manufacturers specified sheet resistance. Commonly specified values lack two items, statistical confidence levels on upper and lower control limits, and the minimum area in which sheet resistance is controlled within those limits with a particular confidence level. The smaller the area, the statistically less the likelihood that the sheet resistance will fall within control limits. To combat this, large embedded components, such as resistors, may be etched in handling areas of a laminate sheet. The resistors are large to offset local sheet resistance effects and variations associated with etching the geometry. The larger the resistor, the less probability a deviation in length to width ratio has on final resistance. These quality control resistors are measured, may be averaged, and compared to the manufacturers control limits. They provide a go/no go quality control checkpoint prior to etching any other embedded component. The problem associated with this checkout procedure still lies in the fact that the resistors are standardize to a set size to meet the manufacturers embedded material control limits restraining the size of the components.Etching variations in the manufacturing process are tuned by way of computer aided design (CAD) or computer aided manufacturing (CAM) changes. Generally, board fabricators will make global changes to the received geometry component design to offset process variability in etching. Prior to etching, an etchant mask is placed down on the copper or nickel alloy material to protect areas where etching is not to occur. These areas may be increased to account for undesirable etching that occurs at the mask extents. Increases are made by way of CAD prior to placing the mask. These global changes, however, do not account for variations in etching that occur horizontally and vertically across the board. Like the embedded material, control points in the etching process are dictated by how they are averaged out over the entire surface area of the board.Corrective trimming, by way of laser or mechanical means, is the third tool currently employed to reduce process and material variations issues. Prior to bonding etched layers of the circuit board together thus encapsulating components, embedded passive geometry is adjusted by removing resistive material such as nickel alloy. This allows for unidirectional adjustment in resistance thus limiting corrections to only increasing resistance. Making use of trimming requires CAD adjustments in component geometry to account not only for the unidirectional limitations of trimming process, but also for changes that occur when the board is exposed to heat in pressure during the lamination process.A conventional embedded passive circuit card process will be described first to serve as a building block of understanding the invented procedure. This process is illustrated in . The manufacturer starts with a composite laminate, , made up of a dielectric layer, , a passive component layer, , and a conductive layer, , as shown in . The dielectric layer is typically made up of a composite structure such as woven glass but can be any other material known in the art. The passive layer is typical comprised of resistive material, such as nickel alloy, for fabricating resistors or inductors, or a capacitive material for constructing capacitors.The etching process starts with the application of a mask to a circuit board. The mask allows the outline of the desired design resistors,  shown in , necessary quality control resistors, , to be formed by two etching steps. The CAD layout for the masking may be globally modified to offset for average etching variations across the board. The first etching step removes selective conductive layer material while the second removes selective passive layer material. The composite laminate is rinsed leaving the outlines of the resistors. A second mask is printed protecting everything from etchant except select portions of the quality control resistors. Copper is again etched away and the board is rinsed of its mask leaving the quality control passive components, labeled  in , complete and ready for inspection. In the case of resistor components, resistance is measured and compared against passive material published control limits. If the inspect points are in compliance to the published data, a final masking and etching step is performed leaving the intended design passive component formed,  in  and ready to be tested.At this point, the iterative trimming process starts. While this process may be automated, it is still very time consuming and costly. The design component, a resistor for example, is measured,  in , to determine to resistance at this point of the process. Multiple measurements and trims, , are made until the resistor is within the desired range. This desired range may not be the ultimate end desired resistance as the component will be exposed to heat and pressure during the lamination process, . Changes can be expected to occur and must be accounted for when the board is bonded with prepreg glue, . Vias, , are added to allow access to the embedded component from the top surface.The current process describe in  employs CAD geometry corrections and quality control resistors in an attempt to minimize the effect material and process related variations have on the fabricated embedded component tolerance. The components, as for the case of embedded resistors, must be sized in the CAD in a manner that allows them to be lower in resistance, as the trimming procedure can only increase resistance. Trimming, performed prior to lamination process, must also account for the additional change the components will experience under heat and pressure during bonding.Employing the current tools described above to tighten the control limits of embedded passive components offsets cost and performances advantages over their surface mounted counterparts. Laser trimming is an iterative procedure requiring multiple measuring and trimming steps to bring components within compliance. Trimming results in lower embedded component circuit yield and added cost. Trimming also decreases the likelihood the components will be successfully employed in high frequency electronic circuits. This is because trimming introduces variability in the current flow path and to the material itself. So while end component tolerance may be significantly decreased, cost is increased and applications are typically limited to low frequency applications.In light of forgoing, there exists a need to improve the manufacturability of embedded passives. There is also a need to adapt to the variability of embedded materials and board fabrication processes. There is further a need to reduce cost and enable embedded passive use in high frequency applications. The processes in the current invention refine both the geometry changes made in the CAD and quality control procedures to eliminate the costly laser trimming procedure.In an embodiment, the disclosed methods provide a fabricating process for a multi-layer printed circuit board containing embedded passive components. The method includes a calibration step wherein a calibration measurement is taken of the geometry or at least one electrical parameter of an arrangement of calibration test points for one or more circuit forming processes, such as masking, etching and/or lamination. A process control step is performed during the process, wherein a process control measurement is taken of at least one electrical parameter at one or more process control test points along one or more axes outside areas in which a circuit is to be formed. An analysis is performed of at least the calibration measurement and the process control measurement to calculate a CAD geometry change required to improve precision of embedded passive components to be printed on the multi-layer printed circuit board. In an embodiment, the analyzing step utilizes initial CAD geometry, measured mask geometry, and measured etched resistor geometry. The CAD geometry is modified in accordance with the calculated CAD geometry change, and multi-layer printed circuit boards containing embedded passive components are manufactured in accordance with the modified CAD geometry. The analyzing step may model variability and adapt to it using a learning model such as a neural network model. The neural network model can learn process and material variations, such as embedded passive material granular variation, etching process variation, lamination stretching effects, and the verification system.The following is a non-limiting example of an overall process for practicing the invention. In fabricating a printed wiring board, various steps introduce process-related errors including those from test equipment used in verification. The first involves the generation of embedded component masking which is derived from CAD information. The calibration of the masking step involves quantifying the variability between CAD geometry and the actual printed mask across the surface of the board. For this step, arrangements of shapes, square resistors for example, are generated in the CAD tool. The square shaped mask is applied across the board area and the dimensions are measured and stored for a later analysis.The manufacturing and calibration process continues with etching. Shapes are formed by the etching away of copper and nickel alloys leaving an exposed resistor. This etching process, like the masking procedure, is measured to quantify variability between etch geometry and mask and CAD geometry, and stored for later analysis.With a collection of embedded resistors, capacitors, or inductors being formed, the board is laminated to the remaining layers typically under heat and pressure with a prepreg bond. Holes are drilled into the circuit card and vias are added to provide access to the embedded passive parts. An electrical parameter such as resistance, capacitance, or inductance is measured for the components across the area of the board and saved for a later analysis. This procedure marks the completion of the calibration step. Calibration may be performed again to account for changes introduced to the manufacturing process such as equipment replacement or for recalibration efforts.The process control step includes utilizing one or more process control test points along one or more axes outside areas in which a circuit is to be formed. Typically this area is used for handling and quality control purposes. From the process control test points, at least one electrical parameter is measured. The process control step occurs during the etching process. The etching process utilizes multiple prints of a mask to complete embedded passive components. For example, resistor outlines are first formed for both end design and quality control resistors or in this case a series of process control resistors along horizontal and vertical axes outside the area where the circuit is to be formed. Only two strips are required on the bottom and right hand side. If a more accurate response is needed the strips can be placed at the top and bottom as well both sides. Both copper and resistive nickel alloy are etched. Next, a mask is printed in a manner that allows copper to be etched only from the process control resistors, leaving the design resistors outlines intact. An electrical parameter such as resistance is measured from the process control resistors and this information is combined with the calibration information for analysis.The analysis is utilized to change the CAD geometry of the design resistors. In particular, the final mask print or square cutout areas, for etching copper away in the outlines of the previously etched design resistors. This leaves exposed resistance material between copper access patches to form the resistor. The analysis utilizes both the calibration and process control information to account for material variability, mask and etchant variability, and the final lamination process variability across the circuit board. The analysis models variability and adapts to it. The model continues to learn and improve with each assortment of boards created as information from process control test points and the normal component verification procedure after lamination is fed into it.Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.The current invention can be broken into two portions, a calibration portion, shown in , and a quality or process control portion, shown in . The calibration portion starts with . Using the same laminate construction, , shown in , outlines of components are etched into the board using the same process shown in . In this case, an assortment of components are etched across the laminate instead of one used to previously describe the current manufacturing process. A second mask, , shown in  is printed onto the laminate resulting in the final areas to be etched, , for the resistors. The geometry, length, L, and width, W, in this example are measured across the board. The actual geometry is not limited to the squares shown and may be any shape that allows for the comparison of CAD geometry to resulting mask geometry.With the mask in place, the final etching of the resistors, , is completed as shown in . Like the mask, the geometry of the etched components is measured for comparison purposes between CAD and mask geometry. All three pieces of information, the CAD geometry, the measured mask geometry, and the measured etched resistor geometry are stored for analysis to be described later. The board is then laminated as described previously in  with holes drilled and vias added completing the build of the final circuit board shown in . The last step of the calibration process utilizes a current verification test step of the final product. The embedded components,  are measured using any of various types of meter, , such as an ohmmeter for resistance, and stored for a later analysis. The calibration process described is not limited to masking, etching, and lamination processes, but any procedure that may introduce variations into the final product. It is also not limited to geometry measurements and may include the recording of an electrical parameter, such as resistance, after the final etch.Upon the conclusion of the calibration portion, the process control portion is utilized in the making of future circuit cards with embedded components. Actual fabrication of the circuit card with embedded passives starts with the same structured laminate of the conventional process shown in . Outlines for both design and process control components are fabricated using the same masking and etching procedures of the conventional process shown in . The difference, however, is a series of quality or process control components, , are fabricated along one or more axes, two in this example shown in , along the horizontal, , and vertical, , axes. These axes are placed outside the area in which the circuit is to be formed, an area typically used for handling an array of circuit boards or quality control purposes. With the series of process components complete, an electrical parameter is measured, such as resistance, from each one to be utilized in conjunction with the calibration data in analysis. This analysis will be utilized to change the CAD geometry of the design component, . An alternative to a series of components, resistors in this case, would be a single horizontal, , and vertical, , resistor as shown in . An electrical parameter may be measured with a time or frequency domain reflectometer, . The means to obtain this information are not limited to these two examples, a series or single component, but any means that can be used to model variations across the laminate.The information from the calibration and process control portions is utilized in an analysis to determine the proper size of the final mask, , of the design resistor as shown in . In particular, length, L, and width, W, for the case of a square component is determined. The laminate with the etched design component, as shown in , is bonded to the remaining layers of the circuit board like that shown in . A final checkout of the components is performed to validate that the manufacturer has met the intended design requirements such as desired resistance or capacitance within control limits. This information is also utilized to improve future embedded passive circuit board builds by way of a learning model.A learning model, or neural network, is an adaptive, statistical data modeling tool that models relationships between input and outputs. Relationships in this case could be variations in material properties or process related control limits across the circuit card. The example described in  include material sheet resistance variation and mask, etch, and lamination geometry changes. In defining these discrete variations across the laminate, the neural model may use a linear regression analysis and/or stochastic processing analysis. For example, matrix and linear algebra may be used to determine the gradient and variation along the panel. This is unlike the traditional method which uses an average to compute control limits as is the case with the quality control components in the corners of the outlying handling areas of the laminate. A C Sharp program using matrix linear algebra and adaptive filtering can be utilized to determine the material variation across the panel in seconds.The above can also be done with the etching process. Etching variation is adjusted for in CAD globally to account for an average variation across the board. Likewise, prior to lamination, the components may be trimmed to undersize their values globally to account for an average increase in resistance for the case of embedded resistors.As illustrated in , the neural model can learn the embedded passive material granular variation and etching process variation such as puddle effects, etch undercut, spray pattern obstructions. The neural model can learn any other material or process variation, including lamination stretching effects as a result of thermosetting pre-impregnation material setting and leaving embedded passive material longer, wider, and thinner, thus shifting resistance. The neural model can learn the verification system wherein embedded passive components are electrically measured.By modeling variations in all of these factors across the entire surface of the laminate, final component tolerances are reduced. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, a variety of different models can be used for implementing a neural analysis described herein to reduce embedded passive component tolerance.Likewise, it should be understood that the invention described herein can be implemented by alternative means of collection of calibration data for distinct procedures for the purpose of understanding variations across the laminate. It should be further understood that alternate means of collection of process control data on each build in locations outside areas where a circuit is to be formed for the purpose of understanding material property variations across the laminate can be implemented. Lastly, it is understood that alternatives to a neural network exist that could utilize both calibration and process control information to reduce embedded passive tolerances.Using the present process in one embodiment, resistors are etched on the side and bottom of the panel. The copper protects the material below the copper with very little chemical variations affecting the embedded material itself. With a long strip of copper on the bottom and side, only square or rectangular resistors are etched into the copper strip to expose the embedded passive material. The copper is still protecting the material under it that is connecting the etched areas of the embedded passive material. This leaves the material continuous across the strip. Since the rectangular and square resistors are large enough, the value of the final etched resistor is a function of the material resistivity and the area of the exposed material. By measuring a number of these resistors and correlating the values given the length and width, a statistical determination can be made of any material variations, without changing the material by excessive etching.The above described methods can provide significant advantages, examples of which will now be given. Prior LASER and annular resistor measurement processes require very expensive specific application equipment for processing. In one embodiment, the described methods require only a very low cost multi-meter. Both the LASER and the annular processes damage the material by cutting or over exposure of the material to etching solutions. The presently described methods can etch the material along the sides of the panel to fabricate the final circuits without affecting the area around the final embedded passive device. That is, the final product need not be etched or cut before making the final product. The time required and man hours spent trying to trim the embedded passive in the LASER process is very extensive. Each process of LASER etching requires on the order of 40 minutes for each resistor. The total time to LASER etch depends on the number of embedded devices. The time to measure as many as 5000 annular resistors can take on the order of 4 hours to measure just one panel. In certain embodiments, the above-described approach requires 10 minutes of measuring for a single panel. The LASER and annular processes require testing and repetitive shaping of the final device. The above-described process does not require repetitive shaping; the process can go from analysis to final embedded passive device for the circuit. There is no trimming or over etching required in the presently disclosed process. The simple method of making one or two resistors at the bottom or side of the boards is not statistically sound and errors are very large. In some embodiments, the above-described process needs only about thirty resistors on the bottom and side to achieve convergence of a statistically sound process and affect analysis. The present process can be practiced without over chemical etching or repetitively damaging the material around the final embedded device by LASER cutting. The present process may be performed without specialty equipment costing on the order of thousands of dollars as in the case of the LASER etching and annular resistor measurements. In some embodiments, the present process requires 10 minutes to determine the final area of the embedded passive device as opposed to four hours to measure five thousand resistors and forty minutes for a single LASER etched and cut resistor.Creating square or rectangular resistors around the edges of the board, that are all connected together, allows the material under the copper strips leading to each of the resistors in the chain to effectively measure the variation without causing a discontinuity between the resistors along the bottom and sides. Prior processes generally do not allow for a continuous undisturbed measurement of the material. In the annular resistor case, each resistor in the order of two thousand resistors will break the material continuity by the fabrication of the resistors themselves. Thus, a string of undisturbed material in the area where the devices will be fabricated would become changed by the process itself. By etching the annular resistors, the material is altered by the mass fabrication of the devices. The etching solution is absorbed into the material, which creates the need for local area analysis of the board. Simply measuring one or two resistors around the board, as has also been done previously, is an inaccurate sample space to analyze the material. This is especially true for larger panels that produce more than one board with repetitive circuits.The present process may be practiced without etching in the center of the panel, and thus not alter the material resistivity. In accordance with one embodiment, only a small portion of the top/bottom and sides of the panel are tested. These areas are normally waste areas in the fabrication process. Therefore the material in the areas of the final product is not altered by excessive etching.While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."

                "This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10,588,345 filed 3 Aug. 2006 as the US national phase of PCT application PCT/EP2005/000951, filed 1 Feb. 2005, published 18 Aug. 2005 as WO2005/076206, and claiming the priority of German patent application 102004006457.1 itself filed 4 Feb. 2004, whose entire disclosures are herewith incorporated by reference.The invention relates to a method for continuously producing electronic film components in the form of transponders, chip modules via their electrical connecting contacts being placed on antennas of antenna film sections, to a method for continuously is producing electronic film components in the form of chip module labels, to an apparatus for carrying out such a method with a chip module station on which the chip modules are stored as well as an adhesive film station on which the module film strip is fed in the form of a roll, and an electronic film component.A method and an apparatus for continuously producing transponders are known from DE 101 20 269 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,972,394). In the known method, chip modules are held on a support tape. An antenna film strip is provided that has a plurality of antenna film sections arrayed in a row behind each other. Each antenna-film section has antenna connections with which electrical terminals of the chip modules have to be connected. The chip modules are detached from the support tape and at the same time applied to the terminals of the antenna film sections and wound together with the antenna film section. The terminals of the chip modules are connected to the antenna connections by laser soldering. Alternatively it is also possible to connect the terminals of the chip modules with the antenna connections by crimping. The soldering or crimping of the chip modules with the antenna film sections is carried out such that both the electrical connection and the fixed positioning of the chip modules relative to the antenna connections are achieved.It is the object of the invention to create a method, an apparatus and an electronic film component of the kind mentioned above that with simple means ensure reliable function of the film components.Electronic components each having a chip module with module contacts and an antenna having antenna contacts is made by securing a plurality of the chip modules spaced apart in a row to the inner face of an elongated module film strip having an outer periphery projecting past the chip module with the chip modules spaced from one another on the module film strip at a uniform predetermined module spacing. A plurality of the antennas are secured to an inner face of an elongated antenna strip with the antennas spaced from one another by a predetermined antenna spacing. The module strip is longitudinally subdivided into sections each of which is of a length equal to the predetermined module spacing and each of which carries a respective chip module. The module-strip sections are pressed against the antenna strip such that the module contacts of each of the chip modules engage and bear on the antenna contacts of a respective antenna. The outer periphery of each of the module-strip sections is then bonded to the inner face of the antenna strip generally all around each of the chip modules.For the method for producing transponders, this object is achieved in that the chip modules with their backs facing away from the connecting contacts are applied to module-strip sections, the base surface of which is substantially greater than a base surface of the chip module, that the electrical connecting contacts of the chip modules are electrically contacted with the antenna connections, and that the module-strip sections are connected flat on the surfaces to the antenna film sections such that the chip modules are fixed in their positions relative to the antenna connections. As a result of the solution according to the invention, the chip modules are electrically contacted exclusively with the antenna connections without there having to be a separate fixing of the chip modules relative to the antenna film sections with this contacting. The fixation of the position of the chip modules relative to the antenna film sections is achieved with the module-strip sections that are connected on the surfaces to the antenna film sections around the respective chip module and that fix the chip module in its position to the antenna connections. Consequently, the chip modules are fixed to the respective antenna-film section by the adhesive film section. The chip modules themselves above all assume the function of electrical contacting with the antenna connections, without having it being necessary to also an independently fix their positions by this contacting. Electrical connections can be formed by the mechanical connection of conductive parts of the connecting contacts and the antenna connections or also through a conductive material connection such as soldering, conductive media, for example conductive adhesive, or the like. The module film strip or the corresponding module-strip sections additionally provided compared to the related art not only create a reliably and uniformly fixed position of the chip modules, but at the same time also form a protective film for the chip module and for the electronic film component formed by the chip module and the corresponding antenna film section. The module-strip sections are preferably adjusted to the antenna film sections in terms of their dimensions. Advantageously, the module-strip sections are dimensioned such that in any case an antenna structure of the respective antenna-film section is covered. Each chip module is electrically insulated between the two electrical connecting contacts, so that upon contacting the connecting contacts with the antenna connections no undesirable shorts can be created. This simplifies the production process for the antenna, since the turns of the antenna can be placed on one side (preferably in printed antennas). The antenna connections are also spaced from each other and electrically insulated in the intermediate space. A chip module has a microchip and a module bridge that forms the electrical connecting contacts of the chip module and with which the microchip is conductively connected. For the electrical contacting of the connecting contacts of the chip modules with the antenna connections, the connecting contacts are preferably provided with contact tips that are made either in advance on the module bridges in a separate operation or continuously directly during the method according to the invention. The antenna film sections are preferably formed in that antenna structures are imprinted on a film section, preferably a sheet of paper. Alternatively, the antenna structures can also be formed by etching away the corresponding coatings. The solution according to the invention is particularly suitable for producing transponders that are used as safety labels for packaging, as safety labels for labeling and/or tailoring products and the like. The module film strip forms a cover layer of the electronic film component.For the method for producing chip module labels, the chip module labels also represent flexible electronic film components, however that have no antenna structures of their own. The chip module labels are preferably applied in a separate, subsequent operation onto surfaces of packaging materials, antenna structures being imprinted on the surfaces or applied otherwise.In one embodiment of the invention, the antenna film sections are part of an antenna film strip, each antenna-film section having an antenna structure that is applied to the antenna film strip. The antenna structure is preferably imprinted. Alternatively, it can be created by etching.In another embodiment of the invention, an module film strip that has an adhesive coating on one side is provided continuously with chip modules at uniform spacings, and subsequently the module film strip is divided into individual module-strip sections, each carrying a chip module. In a further embodiment, the division of the module film strip into individual module-strip sections occurs before the electrical contacting of the chip modules with the antenna connections. In both cases, the module-strip sections are conveyed continuously, synchronously with the antenna film strip, such that the connecting contacts of the chip modules are at exactly the same level as the antenna connections of the antenna structures of the antenna film sections. This way, with continuous conveyance of the antenna film strip, exact electrical contacting of the chip modules with the antenna-film section can take place. At the same time, or directly thereafter, the chip modules are fixed in place by pressing the is module-strip sections on the antenna film sections. The module-strip sections are preferably provided with an adhesive coating that is glued to the surface to the antenna film strip. Since the chip modules protrude slightly compared to the antenna film sections, each adhesive film section automatically stretches across the chip module and presses it against the antenna film strip. The module film strip is preferably separated into the individual module-strip sections already after the chip modules have been applied to the module film strip, however prior to contacting the chip modules with the antenna film strip. To this end, preferably rotating cutting tools are provided that divide the module film strip into the individual module-strip sections in a continuous process before the sections are connected to the antenna film sections of the antenna film strip. Particularly with the method for producing the chip module labels, the module film strip may be provided with a punched structure that can be pulled off together with the peel strip after connecting the adhesive film section, sort of in a film-like punched grid.In a further embodiment of the invention, the contact tips of the electrical connecting contacts of the chip modules are mechanically pressed into the electrically conductive antenna connections. The mechanical connection primarily serves to establish the electrical contacting of the chip modules with the antenna connections. The chip modules are fixed on the antenna film strip—as described above—already by the module-strip sections.In a further embodiment of the invention, the module film strip and the peel strip are connected across the surfaces thereof and wound in a composite film strip onto a roll, the composite film strip is then unwound from the roll, and the module film strip and the peel strip are pulled away from each other prior to applying the chip modules and fed to different sheet paths. The peel strip forms a support layer for the module film strip and protects the module film strip and the chip modules from damage. At the same time, the peel strip forms the non-adhesive protective layer for the module film strip so as to prevent contamination of the adhesive coating.In a further embodiment of the invention, the chip modules that have been applied to the antenna film sections of the antenna film strip by means of the module-strip sections, are wound on a roll together with the antenna film strip. This way, simple and reliable storage of the electronic film components can be achieved. It is preferred if the electrical/electronic functions of the film components are verified prior to rolling up the chip modules together with the antenna film strip. This way it is possible to mark film components without functions or transponders with malfunctions in order to be able to sort them in a subsequent step.In a further embodiment of the invention, the electrical connecting contacts of the chip modules and/or the antenna connections are provided with substantially pyramidal, hard and conductive particles that are oriented such that the tips of the pyramids point in the direction of the corresponding connection. This increases the quality of the electrical contacting, since due to the high pressure present at the tip of the pyramid during a contacting process the tip penetrates into the deforming material of the corresponding connecting partner, thus creating a conductive electrical connection.In a further embodiment of the invention, prior to the electrical contacting of the electrical connecting contacts of the chip modules with the antenna connections and prior to connecting the module-strip sections to the antenna film sections, an adhesive is applied to the antenna film sections that adhesive following the electrical contacting and the connection forms an adhesive coating, the minimal expansion of which is defined by the boundary surfaces between the chip modules and the antenna film sections and the maximal expansion is defined by the boundary surfaces between the module-strip sections and the antenna film sections. This improves the adhesive force, thus resulting in a more secure fixing of the chip modules relative to the antenna connections.In a further embodiment of the invention, following the electrical contacting of the electrical connecting contacts of the chip modules with the antenna connections and following the connection of the module-strip sections to the antenna film sections, a support layer, particularly a silicone support layer, is applied to the antenna film sections, and/or a cover layer is applied to the module-strip sections. This way, a film component can be reliably stored in a simple manner and it can be detached from the silicone support layer as needed and be glued, for example, to a packaging material.For the apparatus for carrying out the method that is provided with a chip module station on which the chip modules are stored, the task underlying the invention is achieved in that an adhesive film station is provided, on which the module film strip is placed in roll form, and in that a transfer station is provided, on which the chip modules are applied with the backs thereof individually to the adhesive surface side of the module film strip, the spacings of the chip modules during application on the module film strip being selected such that an adhesive film section surrounding the associated chip module has a considerably larger surface than the base surface of the respective chip module. Alternatively, either a peel strip is placed, preferably in roll form, on a connecting station or an antenna film strip is placed on an antenna film station. The described solution ensures that the corresponding adhesive film section results in a securely fixed chip module on a peel strip (chip module label) or on the associated antenna-film section (transponder) of the antenna film strip. By feeding the module film strip and the antenna film strip or the peel strip in roll form, it is possible to continuously pull off the sheets from the corresponding rolls. This allows continuous production of the film components. As a result, a large number of corresponding film components can be made in a relatively short time, be it transponders with antenna structures or chip module labels without antenna structures.The apparatus operates based on the roll-on-roll method and thus allows continuous processing of the individual parts of the film components. According to the invention, the adhesion, and consequently fixation, of the chip modules and the creation of the electrical conductivity between the chip modules and antenna structures are distributed to two different areas. The solution according to the invention is particularly suitable for producing labels with electronic functions, particularly with electronic security or identification functions.In one embodiment of the invention, a contacting station is provided for the continuous mechanical contacting of the electrical connecting contacts of the chip modules to the antenna connections of antenna film sections of the antenna film strip. On this contacting station, preferably existing contact tips of the connecting contacts of the chip modules are connected to the antenna connections of the antenna film strip. The contacting station is intended for the electrical contacting of the chip modules with the antenna connections.In a further embodiment of the invention, an adhesion station is provided, on which the module-strip sections protruding beyond the chip modules are connected on the surfaces thereof to the antenna film sections with which the respective chip module is electrically contacted. It is preferred if the adhesion station and the contacting station are integrated in a common unit of the apparatus so as to be able to achieve the electrical contacting and the fixation of the chip modules substantially simultaneously.In a further embodiment of the invention, the width of the module film strip is greater than a width of the module-strip sections. This way it is possible to provide the module film strip with a punched structure and to remove a corresponding punching grid as a waste product after connecting the module film strip to the peel strip and thus achieve the desired pre-punched and separated module-strip sections.In a further embodiment of the invention, at least one monitoring station is provided that verifies the function of the transponders. Additionally it may advantageous to provide a marking station in order to be able to mark transponders on which malfunctions were discovered.In a further embodiment of the invention, a connecting station is provided, on which the antenna film strip, including the chip modules applied thereon and the module-strip sections, are wound onto a roll. This composite roll forms a compact storage roll for the finished electronic film components.In a further embodiment of the invention, the transfer station has a separating unit for separating the chip modules as well as a turning station for transferring the chip modules with the backs to the module film strip. This way, the chip modules are already placed in the position in which they subsequently have to be applied to the antenna film section.In a further embodiment of the invention, a separating station is provided for separating the module film strip with the chip modules into separate module-strip sections.In a further embodiment of the invention, a gluing station is provided where an adhesive is applied to the antenna film strip or the peel strip. It is advantageous if the gluing station is provided in front of the adhesion and contacting station viewed in the sheet conveying direction. Furthermore, it is advantageous if the gluing station controls the application of adhesive such that appropriate adhesive surfaces are only created in the areas of the chip modules on the antenna film strip or the peel strip. This supports the self-adhesive properties of the film strips and thus improves accurate positioning of the chip modules. The partial adhesive application saves adhesive material and prevents the disruptive gluing or contamination of areas that do not require any adhesive application.In a further embodiment of the invention a support film station is provided, on which the support layer is fed in film form in the wound state.In a further embodiment of the invention a cover film station is provided, on which the cover layer is fed in film form in the wound state.In a further embodiment of the invention, a gluing station is provided, on which an adhesive is applied to the cover layer and/or the support layer.The electronic film component according to the invention can be made with the method according to the invention described above.shows a drastically enlarged illustration of an electronic film component that is not to scale. Contrary to the impression that may arise from , the film component is not rigid or dimensionally stable, but rather is flexible. According to , the film component is preferably a flexible film label that is configured as a transponder, for instance usable in an RFID tag.To this end, an antenna ′ that has two imprinted antenna connections  is imprinted on an inner face of a respective short section of an antenna film strip . As will be described in more detail hereinafter, the antenna film strip  is formed by a succession of the antenna film sections each associated with a respective antenna ′. The antenna film sections adjoin each other and can be separated by perforations. Alternatively, it is possible to separate the different antenna film sections with suitable cutting or punching tools upon completion of the film components. Perforations allow the antenna film sections to be severed without tools, thus separating the film components. As will be described in more detail hereinafter, the antenna film strip  has an inner surface carrying a row of antenna-forming film components arrayed in series on the antenna film strip , the components all being configured identically. For a simpler illustration,  therefore only shows one film component by way of example.Each film component is provided with a chip module  that has an electronic semiconductor component  and a module bridge. The semiconductor component is preferably a microchip. The corresponding module bridge on the one hand serves to secure the microchip. On the other hand, it establishes an electrical connection with the microchip. For this purpose, the module bridge has electrical contacts  on each side of the microchip  and provided with contact pins or contact tips  that protrude downward to the antenna film strip . The contacts  of the module bridge of the chip module  are spaced identically to the antenna connections  such that the connecting contacts  are positioned exactly above the antenna connections  and are electrically contacted with the antenna connections  when the contact tips  penetrate into the antenna connections . As a result of the electrical contacting of the module bridge with the antenna ′, the desired transponder is made.Each chip module  is held on an adhesive coating  carried on an inner face of a respective section of a module film strip . Thus, the back of each chip module  opposite the respective contact tips  is glued to the respective section of the strip . The surface area of each of the identical adhesive module-strip sections is substantially larger than the surface area of each of the identical chip modules  so that the adhesive module-strip sections overlap the chip module  on the outside on all sides. Since each adhesive section of the strip adhesive module-strip sections where it confronts the antenna film strip  has a an inner face entirely coated with the adhesive coating , every adhesive section of the strip adhesive module-strip sections can be glued around the chip module  over its entire surface to the confronting inner face of the antenna film strip . This way, the chip module  is secured in position on the antenna film strip . At the same time, the electrical contacting of the contact tips  with the antenna connections  is also established. The chip module  as well as the imprinted antenna connections  of the antennas ′ together have a height of less than 1 mm, so that the resultant film label protrudes minimally even in the area of the chip module  or is minimally elevated in relation to the remaining label surface.The adhesive coating  is preferably made with a UV-curable adhesive with a preferred thickness of 20 mm. The module film strip, and therefore also the adhesive section of the strip adhesive module-strip sections, is preferably made of a polyethylene support film that preferably is transparent or opaque and has a preferred thickness of 50 mm. Each chip module  thus has an overall thickness of about adhesive module-strip sections 0 mm. The thickness of the antenna connections is about 30 mm. The thickness of the antenna film strip  is about adhesive module-strip sections 0 mm. In a transition region of corresponding antennas ′, the module bridges of the chip modules  are preferably provided with an insulating layer in order to prevent short circuits of the antenna sheets.The chip module may also be applied to a surface of a packaging item that has preferably been provided with an imprinted antenna ′. For this purpose, a chip module label is made with the apparatus according to .In order to produce the described electronic film components, according to  a machine is provided that operates continuously in the roll-on-roll method. The machine shown schematically in  is an apparatus for producing electronic film components as defined by the invention. The machine according to  has an adhesive film station  where the module film strip  that is provided with the adhesive coating  on its inner face is wound on a roll. The adhesive coating  of the module strip  is covered by a removable peel strip  formed by a silicone support film in the illustrated embodiment. The module film strip  is unwound from the roll such that inner face with the adhesive coating  is directed upward. So as to expose the adhesive coating , a peel strip  is removed and wound onto a support roll .The module film strip , together with the adhesive coating , travels through a transfer station , , , where the chip modules  on are separated and applied to the adhesive coating  with the backs facing away from the contact tips  and set at a relatively short spacing. The transfer station ,  on which the chain of chip modules  is separated and the individual chip modules are applied to the module film strip , has a turning station  with two deflection rollers rotating in opposite directions in addition to a separating apparatus . The chip is modules  are initially formed as a chain and pulled from a storage roll . When removing the chain of chip modules  formed this way, the connecting contacts  of each chip module  are provided with the contact tips  on a contact-preparation or embossing station . Thereafter, the chip module chain is separated into individual modules  on the separating station  that is preferably configured as a cutting tool. The individual chip modules  are first entrained by a deflection roller rotating counterclockwise according to the illustration in , the chip modules  adhering to the outer surface of the deflection roller. Then, the chip modules  are forwarded to a further deflection roller rotating in the opposition direction, i.e. clockwise, of the turning station  that is provided beneath the upper deflection roller. The transfer of each chip module  from the upper to the lower deflection roller is carried out in a tangential plane region between the two deflection rollers. The lower deflection roller is also provided on the outer circumference with gripper means, preferably vacuum bores of suctions hole, in order to transport the chip modules  on the outer surface angularly. By transferring the chip modules  from the upper to the lower deflection roller, the chip modules  no longer rest with their backs, but instead with their fronts carrying the contact tips  directed radially outward of the turning station . The peripheral speed of the lower deflection roller  is the same as the travel speed of the module film strip  such that the chip modules  are applied to the module film strip  at uniform spacings and are fixed on the adhesive coating , these spacings being bigger than the spacings between the modules  in the chain on the supply roll . The turning station  has beneath the module film strip  a support roller  that conveys the module film strip  in a strip-travel direction and at the same time forms a counter-support for pressing the chip modules  onto the glue layer  on the module film strip .The module film strip  with the chip modules  is transported to a continuously operating separating apparatus that is configured as a rotating cutting tool . It transversely severs the strip  between succeeding modules at a so-called module spacing that is still relatively short, but of course greater than the spacing of the modules  on the supply roll .Alternatively to the embossing station , it is possible to form the contact tips  of the electrical connecting contacts  of the chip modules  only after the chip modules  have been applied to the module film strip . For this purpose, a metering station ′ is provided that carries out the corresponding production of the contact tips.In both variations for producing the contact tips, the module film strip  with the chip modules  applied thereon is separated by the cutter  into several module-strip sections each carrying a chip module . These are deflected by means of a deflection roller  and applied to the antenna film strip  by an adhesion and contacting station , . The antenna film strip  is the wound on a storage roll  on an antenna film station and is pulled off the storage roll  continuously. The antenna film strip  has a plurality of antennas ′ arrayed in a row, each with two antenna connections . As has been described above, the antenna ′ is imprinted or alternatively etched on the antenna film strip . The antennas ′ are provided at uniform spacings from each other on the antenna film strip, this antenna spacing being substantially greater than the overall length of the sections of the strip  carrying the modules , an effect achieved by rotating the roller  at a peripheral speed greater than that of the roller  and equal to the travel speed of the strip  upstream of the cutter .The module-strip sections as well as the chip modules  are applied by the contacting and adhesion station ,  at uniform spacings from each other continuously on the antenna film strip  such that the contact tips of each chip module  meet exactly with the antenna connections  of each antenna printed on the strip . The module-strip sections as well as the chip modules are pressed continuously on the continuously passing antenna film strip , as a result of which the contact tips  cut wedge-like into the antenna connections  of the antennas ′ thereon while making the necessary electrical contact. This way, the transponders shown in  are made. At the same time, the corresponding deflection and pressure rollers of the adhesion and contacting station ,  that act on the module-strip sections and the antenna film strip  from both sides, are spring-biased against the strips  and  and have elastomeric outer surfaces so that the module-strip sections are pressed against the adhesive coatings  of the respective antenna-strip sections as the chip modules are pushed in. The adhesive coating  thus creates a peripheral seal around each module  and the respective antenna ′ of the antenna film strip  that secures the electrical contacting of the chip modules  with the antennas ′. The schematic illustration according to  does not show that the module-strip sections are connected on the surfaces with the antenna film strip after passing through the adhesion and contacting station , .The film components formed and made this way are conveyed on the antenna film strip  and pass through a checking station  in which the electrical and/or electronic functions of the transponder are tested. Thereafter, the successive row or chain of transponders also passes through a marking station  where the film components are marked in terms of a potentially discovered malfunction, particularly by means of ink jet printing. Finally, the chain of film components is wound onto a storage roll of a collecting station , this roll being suitable for storage or for further transport of the film components.In the example according to , all units, components and sheets with identical functions have been assigned identical reference numerals as in . Only the functionally identical module film strip has additionally been assigned the letter “a”. A significant difference is that in this example self-adhesive chip module labels without transponder function, i.e. without antennas ′, are made. These chip module labels are applied to surfaces, particularly to surfaces of packages, with corresponding antennas ′ being provided only in a subsequent process that is not shown here.In the embodiment according to , the peel strip is reused as a support layer for the completed chip module labels. The module film strip and the peel strip are wound in a self-adhesive configuration on a feed roll of a feeding station . So as to expose the adhesive coating  that is not described in detail of the module film strip , the peel strip is removed directly after unwinding the feed roll of the feeding station , is then guided around the system above the chip module station - and returned as the support layer to the adhesion and contacting station , . The adhesion and contacting stations in this embodiment only serve for the application of the chip modules to the peel strip , without carrying out any additional electrical contacting function, since there is no antenna film strip.The turning station  that is used to apply the chip modules  to the module film strip is configured identically to the embodiment according to , so that it does not need to be described in detail here. Another difference of the embodiment according to  is that the separating apparatus in the form of a rotating cutting tool  is disengaged in this embodiment. The module film strip is not divided into individual module-strip sections upstream of the adhesion and contacting stations , . The module film strip with the chip modules  applied thereon rather is maintained as a unit and is deflected around the corresponding deflection roller of the adhesion and contacting station ,  such that the module film strip is conveyed at the same travel speed as the peel strip parallel in the same direction. The chip modules  are applied to the module film strip at uniform spacings from each other, so that later they can be removed as chip module labels from the peel strip that is a silicone support film. Furthermore, the module film strip of the peel strip is guided in the area of the adhesion and contacting station ,  such that the chip modules rest on the peel strip with their contact tips. At the same time, the entire module film strip is glued around the chip modules  onto the peel strip , thus producing a composite film strip. In the conveying direction, downstream of the adhesion and contacting station , a separating station  is provided that punches out the module-strip sections of the module film strip by means of rotating punching tool and removes the remaining ladder-shaped waste  upward. The punching tool  does not touch the peel strip . As a result, the module-strip sections with the chip modules remain on the peel strip , the module-strip sections having a width that is less than that of the module film strip in order to achieve continuous, endless removal of the waste punching grid of the module film strip . This produces the chip module labels held on the peel strip. The finished film components (chip module labels), including the peel strip , are wound onto a storage roll of the connecting station . The storage roll made this way has a string of film components in the form of the chip module labels without transponder functions.shows a considerably enlarged and not-to-scale sectional view of a further electronic film component in the form of a transponder that can be made with an apparatus according to . The combination of chip module , the adhesive layer , and the section of the strip  shown in  has been combined into an intermediate layer element . In the example according to , all further elements with identical functions have been assigned identical reference numerals as in . The intermediate element  as shown in  is electrically contacted with the antenna connections  of an antenna of an antenna-film section of the antenna film strip  and fixed in position relative to the antenna connections . Furthermore, unlike the film component shown in , a support layer  made of silicone and a cover layer  are provided that are connected in a material connection with the help of the adhesive coatings  and  to the top of the antenna film strip  and the intermediate layer element  and/or a bottom of the antenna film strip .A punching tool  that is used to sever all layers except for the support layer  during a punching operation is used to separate the different antenna film sections after completion of the film components. Following the punching operation, the film component can be pulled from the support layer , the adhesive coating  remaining on the removed component, thus making it self-adhesive, allowing it to be applied to a packaging material, for example.shows an alternative embodiment of an electronic film component in the form of a transponder that in comparison with the embodiment according to  has a shorter antenna film strip  and/or a shorter antenna-film section and a similarly shorter adhesive coating . Elements with identical functions have in turn been assigned identical reference numerals.shows a further alternative embodiment of an electronic film component in the form of a transponder that in comparison with the embodiments according to  has two fewer layers. Elements with identical functions have in turn been assigned identical reference numerals. On a side of the cover layer facing the intermediate layer element  of the cover layer an antenna is provided that is not shown, but which is again in electrical contact with the intermediate layer element . By combining the antenna and cover layers, consequently 2 layers can be saved.is a further embodiment of an apparatus for continuously producing electronic film components according to , In addition to the apparatus according to , the apparatus has first to third gluing stations  to , a support film station  on which the sheet-like support layer  is fed in film form in the wound state, a cover film station  on which the sheet-like cover layer  is fed in film form in the wound state, collecting rollers  to  and a punching station . In the example according to , all further elements with identical functions have been assigned identical reference numerals as in .Prior to the electrical contacting and prior to connecting the adhesive module-strip sections to the antenna film sections in the adhesion and contacting station , , the first gluing station  applies a adhesive  (see also ) to the antenna film sections such that following the electrical contacting and the connection an adhesive coating forms between the adhesive module-strip sections and the chip modules  on the one hand and the antenna film sections or the antenna film strip  on the other hand, the minimal extension of which is defined by the regions between the chip modules  and the antenna film sections and the maximal extension of which is defined by the boundary surfaces between the adhesive module-strip sections and the antenna film sections. The adhesive is consequently not applied continuously, but is instead applied in cycles to discrete regions such that the desired local adhesive distribution is achieved. The application of adhesion effected by the first gluing station  supports the self-adhesive properties of the adhesive module-strip sections, resulting in improved adhesion and thus a more secure fixation of the chip modules  relative to the antenna connections .The support film station  is used to feed the sheet-like support layer  to the second gluing station , where it is provided with the adhesive coating  shown in . Thereafter, the support layer  with the adhesive coating  is connected to the bottom of the antenna film strip , thus causing the adhesive coating  to create a material connection between the antenna film strip  and the support layer . For the protection of the support layer , the layer is wound together with a protective film or a protective layer  in the support film station , with the film or layer being removed from the support layer  during the feeding process and rolled onto the collecting roller .The cover film station  is used to feed the sheet-like cover layer  to the third gluing station , where it is provided with the adhesive coating  shown in . Subsequently, the cover layer  comprising the adhesive coating  is connected to the top of the antenna film strip  and the intermediate layer element , a material connection being established by the adhesive coating . For the protection of the cover layer , the layer is wound together with a protective film or a protective layer  in the cover film station , with the film or layer being removed from the cover layer  during the feeding process and rolled onto the collecting roller .The gluing stations  and  are optional. If the cover layer  and/or the support layer  are configured as self-adhesive coatings, the associated adhesive coating  and/or  that is protected by the protective film and/or protective layer  and/or , has already been placed on the cover layer  and/or the support layer  when it is wound on the associated film station  and/or . The additional application of adhesive by the gluing stations  and  is consequently no longer required in this case.After both the support layer  and the cover layer  have been applied, the resulting layer composite is fed to the punching station  that separates all layers with the exception of the support layer  by means of the punching tool  shown in . A resulting waste punching grid  is removed toward the top and wound on the collecting roll . The remaining layer composite, i.e. the finished film components and/or transponders, is wound on the storage roll of the connecting station  that is suitable for storage or further transport of the film components.is a further embodiment of an apparatus for continuously producing electronic film components without antennas ′. In addition to the apparatus according to , the is apparatus has a gluing station . In the example according to , all further elements with identical functions have been assigned identical reference numerals as in . Prior to joining the module film strip and the peel strip in the area of the adhesion and contacting station , , the gluing station  is used to apply an adhesive  to the peel strip such that an adhesive coating is made in the area of the chip modules  are joining the sheets and . The adhesive is consequently not applied continuously, but is instead applied in cycles such that the desired local adhesive distribution is achieved. The application of adhesive effected by the gluing station  supports the self-adhesive properties of the peel strip , thus improving adhesion.shows top views of unprocessed chip modules , processed chip modules whose connecting contacts  have been installed, as well as adhesive module-strip sections, to which the processed chip modules have been applied and/or glued. The unprocessed chip modules are wound, for example, on the chip module station  according to  on the storage roll, strung together.The upper connecting contacts  of the chip modules are provided by way of example with contact tips  that can be made, for example, by the contact preparation station or embossing station  according to . The lower connecting contacts  of the chip modules are alternatively provided with substantially pyramidal, hard and conductive particles  that are oriented such that the tips of the pyramids point in the direction of the corresponding connection, i.e. the antenna connection. A large base of a particle  ideally comes in contact with the connecting contact  over its entire surface. To simplify the illustration, only a few particles or pyramids  are shown for each connecting contact . In fact, however, many, for example several hundred particles  are provided for each connecting contact . The particles  can, for example, be made of nickel-coated diamond dust. The size of the particles typically ranges between 4 mm and 25 mm. If during a contacting operation on the bottom surface a slight pressure builds, a pressure increase results at the tip of the particle  that is proportional to the ratio of the surfaces. When the tip of the particle  pushes on the corresponding connection, the tip penetrates into the deforming material of the connecting partner and thus creates a conductive electrical connection. The particle  is typically already applied during the production of the chip modules .on the right shows adhesive module-strip sections to which the processed chip modules have already been applied and/or glued. The chip modules , an adhesive coating that is not shown, and the adhesive module-strip sections together form an intermediate layer element  according to . The intermediate layer element  formed this way can be connected considerably more easily to the antenna film sections than a chip module .shows top views of such an intermediate layer element  of an antenna-film section  with an antenna  that has the antenna connections , as well as the intermediate layer element  that has been applied to the antenna connections  rotated relative to the view on the left. The connection of the intermediate layer element  and antenna-film section  already represents a functional transponder that as shown in  now only is given the support and cover layers.So as to be able to carry out the methods according to the invention, as they are described according to , automatically and continuously in the apparatus, a central controller is provided that controls the corresponding stations, tools and speeds of the conveying and deflection rollers. It is also conceivable to monitor the relevant physical variables of the individual functional and apparatuses, including the stations, tools, conveying and deflection rollers, through corresponding sensor units and to transmit corresponding signals or feedback messages to the controller, thus allowing control of the processing and manufacturing procedures of the film components."

                "The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing passive components, and more particularly, to a method for manufacturing an alloy resistor.A conventional resistor is, for example, a ceramic resistor having axial leads on both sides, thereafter, different types of surface mount chip resistors are fabricated by thick film printing process, which mainly perform a series of processes including a printing process, a laser-modification process, a process for forming copper electrode ends, and an electroplating process in order to form a desired resistor on a selected ceramic substrate.In addition, an alloy transistor is also used widely. However, as shown in , when the alloy transistor is made by a traditional thick film printing process, the printing process has directional limitation. If the printing direction is not paid more attention during the printing process, it is easily to fail to form a ring-shaped insulating layer  which can cover an insulating cover area  of an alloy resistor unit  during the printing process of the insulating layer . Therefore, the product yield decreases.To solve above problem, a method for forming an insulating layer by spray coating process is provided. However, when the surface of the insulating layer which is formed by spray coating process is not uniform or the workpieces has a dead angle, the subsequent surface adhesion process will be affected. In addition, in spray coating process, since the spray coating material has a lower flash point, the temperature control should be paid much attention to its surroundings for avoiding a process risk. Also, the dryness of spray particles and the dust control are key factors to influence the product quality during the spray process. Furthermore, there is a method for forming the insulating layer such as epoxy resin by a press molding. However, if various appearances of alloy resistors are required, an additional mold will be necessary to fabricate, and in addition, the remained excess epoxy resin in mold channels often adhered to workpieces which has to be removed. Thus, the increased working hours for removing the excess epoxy resin and the additional expenses of fixtures and equipments may lead to inconvenient processes and reduce the cost advantage.Therefore, it is a necessary to develop an easy and efficient manufacturing method capable of obtaining an alloy resistor having an insulating layer with a smooth surface under the existent process.In light of the drawbacks of the aforementioned prior art, the present invention provides an alloy resistor having an insulating layer with a smooth surface.According to the present invention, a fabrication method for forming an alloy resistor is provided. The fabrication method comprises the steps of: providing an alloy sheet having a plurality of openings spacing apart from each other and going through the alloy sheet and a plurality of alloy resistor units located between any two adjacent openings, wherein each of the alloy resistor units has an insulating cover area and a plurality of electrode ends on both sides of the insulating cover area; forming an insulating layer on a surface of the insulating cover area of the alloy resistor units by an electrodepositing process; cutting the alloy sheet to obtain separated alloy resistor units; and forming a conductive adhesion material on the electrode ends of the alloy resistor units.In the aforesaid method, the openings are formed by stamping, and the fabrication method for forming the insulating layer includes forming a deposition resistant layer on a surface of the alloy sheet for exposing the insulating cover area of the alloy resistor units; forming the insulating layer by an electrodeposition coating process; and removing the deposition resistant layer.In addition, the fabrication method for forming the alloy resistor may further comprise forming a conductive layer such as copper on the electrode ends after covering the insulating layer. Alternatively, the conductive layer can be formed by barrel-plating. Furthermore, the conductive adhesion material can be made of one or more selected from the group consisting of nickel and stannum.In the present invention, a plurality of openings spacing apart from each other and going through the alloy sheet are formed in the alloy sheet, and a ring-shaped insulating layer is plated on the alloy sheet with a side surface of the openings by an electrodepositing process, wherein the insulating layer is formed by a plating material with positive or negative ions, as a result, an insulating layer having a smooth surface can be obtained.Hereunder, embodiments of the present invention will be described in full detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.The following specific embodiment is provided to illustrate the present invention. Others skilled in the art can readily gain an insight into other advantages and features of the present invention based on the contents disclosed in this specification. The present invention can also be performed or applied in accordance with other different embodiments. Various modifications and changes based on different viewpoints and applications yet still within the scope of the present invention can be made in the details of the specification.are cross-sectional views illustrating a fabrication method for forming an alloy resistor according to a first embodiment of the present invention.As shown in , an alloy sheet  is provided and it can be a flat sheet or a strip material, and may be made of a material selected from the group consisting of nickel, chromium, magnesium, aluminum, and copper, or made of an alloy composed of any metals selected from the aforesaid group. The alloy sheet  includes a plurality of openings  spacing apart from each other and going through the alloy sheet ; a plurality of alloy resistor units  located between any two adjacent openings , wherein each alloy resistor units  has an insulating cover area  and electrode ends  located on both sides of the insulating cover area . The openings  of the alloy sheet  are often formed by a stamping process.As shown in , an insulating layer  is formed on the surface of the insulating cover area  of the alloy resistor units  by an electrodeposition coating process. Specifically, the formation of the insulating layer  comprises the following steps: forming a deposition resistant layer  on a surface of the alloy sheet , and the insulating cover area  of the alloy resistor units  is exposed; placing the alloy sheet  into a tank (not shown in the drawing) which contains positive or negative ions and making the alloy sheet  electrical conductive, and then a plating material with positive or negative ions is plated to the surface of the insulating cover area , so as to form the insulating layer ; and removing the deposition resistant layer , as shown in . The electrodeposition coating process is carried out by forming the plating material with positive or negative ions on a surface which is to be plated, such that there is no the drawback of directional limitation of printing process and the non-uniform problem of the film of spray coating process. In addition, according to various requirements, the pattern of the deposition resistant layer  can be changed, such as exposing the both electrode ends  of the alloy resistor units . Thus, the coating material can cover portions of the electrode ends . That is, the insulating layer  can extend to portions of electrode ends  from the insulating cover area .Again referring to , the alloy sheet  is cut along a separating line , so as to form separated alloy resistor units .Finally, a conductive adhesion material  is formed on the electrode ends  of the alloy resistor units , and thus an alloy resistor can be obtained according to the present invention. The conductive adhesion material  can be made of one or more selected form the group consisting of nickel and stannum. Furthermore, the conductive adhesion material  is completely covering the surface of the electrode ends , as shown in . However, the conductive adhesion material  also can be formed on a single side of the electrode ends  in order to connect the alloy resistor to other electrical device such as a circuit board.In addition, the formation of the alloy resistor further can include forming a conductive layer such as copper on the electrode ends after covering the insulating layer.However, the formation of the conductive layer on the electrode ends may also be formed by barrel plating after separating the alloy resistor units.Second Exemplary Embodimentare schematic diagrams illustrating a method for manufacturing an alloy resistor according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the alloy resistor units  of the alloy sheet  are arranged in a staggered array and further include a connecting portion  joining two adjacent electrode ends  of alloy resistor units . In details, the connecting portion  is for connecting a back electrode end  from one of the alloy resistor units  with a front electrode end  from another alloy resistor units . On the other hand, the separated alloy resistor units  can be obtained by cutting the connecting portion .In the present invention, a plurality of openings spacing apart from each other and going through the alloy sheet are formed on the alloy sheet, and the alloy sheet with a side surface of the openings is covered with a ring-shaped insulating layer by an electrodeposition coating process, wherein the insulating layer is formed by a plating material with positive or negative ions, as a result, an insulating layer having a smooth surface can be obtained. The mechanism of electrodeposition is that the plating material is dispersed in the water. When the electrodeposition system is electrical conductive by applying a voltage, the plating material will deposit on the surface of the insulating cover area, and forms a uniform and insoluble insulating layer. One of advantages of electrodeposition is that it can obtain a uniform coating film by adjusting the applied voltage and also due to little water and solvent contents in the coating film, a good plating surface is formed and bubbles or void are not produced. Due to a high permeability of liquid coating material, electrodeposition coating process can fully implement the insulating layer on any parts of workpieces that the conventional methods of spray coating or painting cannot achieve. As a result, the corrosion-resisting capability of workpieces will be improved. Another advantage is that after diluting the coating material in electrodeposition coating system with water, the solvent content of coating film is lower and therefore, it is not flammable. Furthermore, the plating material is not greatly depleted, when workpieces are processed with electrodeposition coating. Because of that, the amount of particles decreases and the environment pollution will be reduced significantly.The invention has been described using exemplary preferred embodiments. However, it is to be understood that the scope of the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements. The scope of the claims, therefore, should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements."

                "This application is a U.S. divisional application filed under 37 CFR .() claiming priority benefit of U.S. Ser. No. 12/379,759 filed in the United States on Feb. 27, 2009, which claims earlier priority benefit to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2008-0112362 filed with the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Nov. 12, 2008, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.1. FieldThe present invention relates to a printed circuit board (PCB) having a flow preventing dam and a manufacturing method thereof, and more particularly to a PCB having a flow preventing dam, in which the flow preventing dam is provided on the peripheral area of the PCB so as to prevent the outflow of an underfill solution which is introduced between the PCB and a semiconductor chip which is flip chip bonded thereto.2. Description of the Related ArtWith the recent advancement of electronics industries, there is a demand for increasing performance and functionality of electronic components and reducing the size thereof. Accordingly, high integration, slimness and fine circuit patterning are also required on a substrate for surface mounting components, such as SIP (System in Package), 3D package, etc.In particular, in techniques for mounting electronic components on the surface of a substrate, a wire bonding process or a flip chip bonding process is utilized for electrical connection between an electronic component and a substrate.The wire bonding process includes bonding an electronic component having design circuits to a PCB using an adhesive, connecting a lead frame of the PCB to a metal terminal (i.e., pad) of the electronic component using a metal wire to transmit and receive information therebetween, and molding the electronic component and the wire with thermosetting resin or thermoplastic resin.The flip chip bonding process includes forming an external connection terminal (i.e., bump) having a size of tens of μm to hundreds of μm on an electronic component using a material such as gold, solder or another metal, and flipping the electronic component having the bump so that the surface thereof faces the substrate and is thus mounted on the substrate, unlike the mounting operation based on the wire bonding.Although the wire bonding process has higher productivity compared to other packaging processes, it needs wires for connection to the PCB, and thus the size of a module is increased and an additional procedure is required. Hence, the flip chip bonding process is mainly employed.are views showing a process of packaging a flip chip semiconductor package according to a conventional technique.As shown in , the flip chip bonding according to the conventional technique is performed in a manner such that solder balls  are attached to the connection pads  of a PCB  and a semiconductor chip  is mounted on the PCB  by means of the solder balls .In this way, however, when the semiconductor chip  is mounted on the PCB , a gap G is formed between the semiconductor chip  and the PCB  due to the height of the solder balls  attached to the connection pads  of the PCB , undesirably weakening the ability to support the semiconductor chip  and causing cracks around the soldering portion of the solder balls . In particular, in the case where a temperature change occurs, the coefficient of thermal expansion between the semiconductor chip  and the PCB  is different, and thus thermal stress is applied to the solder balls , thereby causing cracks on the solder balls .Hence, with the goal of stably supporting the semiconductor chip , an underfill solution  of a liquid material is introduced into the gap G between the semiconductor chip  and the PCB  using a dispenser .The underfill solution  is introduced in a small amount between the semiconductor chip  and the PCB  and thus functions as an adhesive for holding the chip and plays a role in protecting the chip from the external environment, unlike a conventional semiconductor molding material (EMC) for packaging the entire semiconductor chip .However, in the course of introducing the underfill solution  using the dispenser , part of the underfill solution  which is introduced into the gap G between the semiconductor chip  and the PCB  may undesirably overflow the outer edge of the PCB  from the position where the dispenser  is located, causing defects.In order to solve this problem, there have been proposed methods of forming a dam on the peripheral area of the PCB using a dispensing process.However, the dispensing process which is used to form a linear dam through linear extrusion of epoxy resin from a dispensing nozzle is problematic in that the width of the dam may be non-uniform, and the shape of the dam may become winding due to frictional force at the end of the dispensing nozzle.Further, an additional dispensing apparatus is required to form the dam, and a process for forming the dam should be additionally carried out.Accordingly, the present invention has been made keeping in mind the problems encountered in the related art and the present invention provides a PCB having a flow preventing dam, which is able to prevent the outflow of an underfill solution, and a manufacturing method thereof.In addition, the present invention provides a PCB having a flow preventing dam, in which the flow preventing dam is formed using a dry film resist for forming a solder bump without a need for an additional dispensing apparatus or dispensing process, and a manufacturing method thereof.According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a PCB having a flow preventing dam includes a base substrate having a solder pad, a solder bump formed on the solder pad of the base substrate, and a flow preventing dam formed on the peripheral area of the base substrate using a dry film resist.As such, a solder resist layer having an opening for exposing the solder pad may be formed on the base substrate.The flow preventing dam may include the dry film resist which is attached in a state of being overcured through excessive exposure to the solder resist layer.Also, a semiconductor chip which is flip chip bonded to the base substrate by means of the solder bump formed on the solder pad of the base substrate may be further included.The flow preventing dam may be provided to protrude from the base substrate along the outer edge of the semiconductor chip, in order to prevent the outflow of an underfill solution which is introduced into a gap between the semiconductor chip and the base substrate.The flow preventing dam may be formed to be lower than the upper surface of the semiconductor chip which is flip chip bonded to the base substrate and to be higher than the gap between the semiconductor chip and the base substrate.The flow preventing dam may be provided between the outer edge of the base substrate and the outer edge of the semiconductor chip.In addition, according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a method of manufacturing a PCB having a flow preventing dam includes (A) applying a dry film resist on a base substrate having a solder pad, and then primarily exposing the dry film resist to light, (B) secondarily exposing the primarily exposed dry film resist formed on a peripheral area of the base substrate to light, thus forming a flow preventing dam, (C) removing the unexposed dry film resist to expose the solder pad, thus forming an opening, (D) printing the opening with a solder paste and then forming a solder bump through a reflow process, and (E) removing the primarily exposed dry film resist.After (E) removing the primarily exposed dry film resist, (F) flip chip bonding a semiconductor chip to the base substrate by means of the solder bump formed on the solder pad of the base substrate may be further included.After (F) flip chip bonding the semiconductor chip, (G) introducing an underfill solution into a gap between the semiconductor chip and the base substrate may be further included.The flow preventing dam may be provided to protrude from the base substrate along the outer edge of the semiconductor chip, in order to prevent outflow of an underfill solution which is introduced into the gap between the semiconductor chip and the base substrate.The flow preventing dam may be formed to be lower than an upper surface of the semiconductor chip which is flip chip bonded to the base substrate and to be higher than the gap between the semiconductor chip and the base substrate.The flow preventing dam may be provided between the outer edge of the base substrate and the outer edge of the semiconductor chip.Also, a solder resist layer having an opening for exposing the solder pad may be formed on the base substrate.The features and advantages of the present invention will be more

With reference to this drawing, the PCB  having a flow preventing dam according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention is described below.As seen in , the PCB  having a flow preventing dam according to the present invention includes a base substrate  having solder pads , solder bumps  formed on the solder pads , and a flow preventing dam formed on a peripheral area thereof.The base substrate  is configured such that the solder pads  are formed on either or both surfaces thereof and a solder resist layer  having openings for exposing the solder pads  is formed.The flow preventing dam is composed of a dry film resist which is attached in a state of being overcured through excessive exposure to the solder resist layer .are a cross-sectional view and a top plan view showing the PCB having a flow preventing dam according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, to which a semiconductor chip is flip chip bonded;As shown in , the semiconductor chip  is flip chip bonded to the base substrate  by means of the solder bumps  formed on the solder pads  of the base substrate , and an underfill solution  is introduced between the semiconductor chip  and the base substrate .The flow preventing dam is provided to protrude from the base substrate  along the outer edge of the semiconductor chip , thus preventing the outflow of the underfill solution .The flow preventing dam is provided between the outer edge of the base substrate  and the outer edge of the semiconductor chip , and is formed to be higher than the gap G between the base substrate  and the semiconductor chip  and to be lower than the upper surface of the semiconductor chip , in order to prevent the outflow of the underfill solution .Method of Manufacturing PCB having Flow Preventing Damare cross-sectional views showing the process of manufacturing the PCB having a flow preventing dam according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.With reference to , the method of manufacturing the PCB having a flow preventing dam according to the present invention is described below.As shown in , a dry film resist  is applied on the baser substrate  having solder pads .The base substrate  is configured such that the solder pads  are formed on one surface thereof and the solder resist layer  having openings  for exposing the solder pads  is formed on the base substrate .The dry film resist  includes a photoresist in a film form, a mylar film formed on one surface of the photoresist to impart flexibility thereto, and a cover film formed on the other surface thereof.The dry film resist  is applied in a state of peeling off the cover film using a typical dry film laminating apparatus.The dry film resist  may be formed to a predetermined thickness in consideration of the size of the solder bumps  and the height of the flow preventing damNext, as shown in , the portion of the dry film resist , other than the portion of the dry film resist  applied on the solder pads , is subjected to a primary exposure process.The primary exposure process is performed by exposing the portion of the dry film resist , other than the portion thereof applied on the solder pads , to UV light, using a mask (not shown) having a predetermined pattern.The primarily exposed dry film resist , other than the unexposed dry film resist applied on the solder pads , is cured through polymerization in the primary exposure process.Next, as shown in , the primarily exposed dry film resist formed on the peripheral area of the base substrate  is subjected to a secondary exposure process, thus forming the flow preventing damAs such, the secondarily exposed dry film resist, which forms the flow preventing dam , is overcured through excessive exposure and is thus more firmly attached to the solder resist layer . Accordingly, the dam is not removed in a subsequent dry film resist stripping process.Next, as shown in , the unexposed dry film resist is removed through a development process to expose the solder pads , thus forming openings .The development process is performed by dissolving and removing the uncured portion other than the cured portion due to UV exposure, and thus the unexposed dry film resist is removed using a developer such as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) or potassium carbonate (K2CO3).Next, as shown in , the openings  are printed with a solder paste.The solder paste  is printed through a screen printing in a manner such that the base substrate  is disposed on a printing table, a mask having a plurality of openings is placed on the base substrate, and the solder paste is pressed into the openings of the mask using a squeegee.Next, as shown in , the printed solder paste  is subjected to a reflow process, thus forming solder bumps .The solder paste  printed in the openings  of the dry film resist  is formed in a round shape through a reflow process to be lower than the flow preventing dam . In the case where the semiconductor chip  is mounted on the solder bumps , the gap G between the base substrate  and the semiconductor chip  is lower than the flow preventing dam , and therefore the flow preventing dam can prevent the outflow of the underfill solution which is introduced into the gap G.As shown in , the primarily exposed dry film resist is removed.The primarily exposed dry film resist may be stripped using a stripping solution such as NaOH or KOH.In the course of bonding the OH— of the stripping solution with the carboxyl group (COOH+) of the dry film resist, the primarily exposed dry film resist gets loose and thus is stripped. Because the secondarily exposed dry film resist, namely, the flow preventing dam , is attached in a state of being overcured through excessive exposure to the solder resist layer , it is not removed by the stripping solution.As shown in , the semiconductor chip  is flip chip mounted on the base substrate  by means of the solder bumps , and the underfill solution  is introduced into the gap G between the base substrate  and the semiconductor chip , thus completing a flip chip package.The flow preventing dam is provided to protrude from the base substrate along the outer edge of the semiconductor chip , and is formed to be higher than the gap between the base substrate  and the semiconductor chip  and to be lower than the upper surface of the semiconductor chip , thereby preventing the outflow of the underfill solution.As described hereinbefore, the present invention provides a PCB having a flow preventing dam and a manufacturing method thereof. According to the present invention, the flow preventing dam is provided, thus preventing the expansion and outflow of an underfill solution.Also, according to the present invention, the flow preventing dam is formed through excessive exposure of a dry film resist used in the course of forming solder bumps, thus obviating a need for additional material, apparatus, and process.Also, according to the present invention, the flow preventing dam can be formed with the dry film resist, and thus the height and width thereof are uniform.Also, according to the present invention, the outflow of the underfill solution is prevented, thus improving the overall package reliability.Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention regarding the PCB having a flow preventing dam and the manufacturing method thereof has been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible within the scope of the invention."

The entire contents of those applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference. This application further is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2000-152973, filed May 24, 2000, 2000-105212, filed Apr. 6, 2000, 2000-078206, filed Mar. 21, 2000, 2000-073558, filed Mar. 16, 2000, and 2000-049121, filed Feb. 25, 2000.The present invention relates to a buildup multilayer printed circuit board and particularly relates to a multilayer printed circuit board including electronic components such as an IC chip and a multilayer printed circuit board manufacturing method.An IC chip is electrically connected to a printed circuit board by a mounting method such as a wire bonding method, a TAB method or a flip-chip method.In the wire bonding method, an IC chip is die-bonded to a printed circuit board by adhesive or the like, the pads of the printed circuit board are connected to the pads of the IC chip by wires such as metallic wires and then a sealing resin such as a thermosetting resin or a thermoplastic resin is applied to protect the IC chip and the wire.In the TAB method, wires referred to as leads are connected in the block by a solder or the like and then the bumps of an IC chip and the pads of a printed circuit board are sealed by a resin.In the flip-chip method, the pads of an IC chip are connected to the pads of a printed circuit board by through bumps and the gaps between the bumps and the respective pads are filled with a resin.In each of these mounting methods, however, the IC chip and the printed circuit board are electrically connected to each other through lead members (wires, leads or bumps) for connection therebetween. These lead members tend to be cut off and eroded, making the connection of the printed circuit board to the IC chip cut off or causing malfunctions.In addition, in each of these mounting methods, a sealing thermoplastic resin such as an epoxy resin is employed to protect the IC chip. However, if bubbles are contained at the time of filling the resin, then the lead members are broken, the IC pads are eroded and reliability of the IC chip is deteriorated due to the bubbles. To seal the IC chip or the like by a thermoplastic resin, it is required to create resin filling plungers and metallic molds in accordance with the respective components of the printed circuit board. Further, in case of employing a thermosetting resin, it is necessary to select a thermosetting resin in view of the materials of the lead members, a solder resist and the like, thereby disadvantageously causing cost increase.The present invention has been made to solve the above-stated problems. It is an object of the present invention to propose a multilayer printed circuit board capable of being directly, electrically connected to an IC chip without using a lead member and a manufacturing method of the multilayer printed circuit board.After being devoted to the intensive studies of the multilayer wiring board, the inventors of the present invention finally devised a structure capable of electrically connecting a multilayer printed circuit board to an IC chip without using leads and a sealing resin by providing opening portions, through holes and counterbore portions in the resin insulating substrate to thereby contain an electronic component such as an IC chip therein in advance, building up a plurality of interlayer insulating layers, providing via holes on the die pads of the IC chip by photoetching or laser, forming conductor circuits serving as conductive layers, and further providing the interlayer insulating layers and the conductive layers repeatedly to thereby provide the multilayer printed circuit board.Moreover, the inventors of the present invention devised a structure of mounting an electronic component, such as an IC chip, on the surface layer of the multilayer printed circuit board by providing opening portions, through holes and counterbore portions in the resin insulating substrate to thereby contain an electronic component, such as an IC chip, therein in advance, building up interlayer insulating layers, providing via holes on the die pads of the IC chip by photoetching or laser, then forming conductor circuits serving as conductive layers and further providing the interlayer insulating layers and the conductive layers repeatedly. With this structure, it is possible to electrically connect the multilayer printed circuit board to the IC chip in without using leads. It is also possible to mount the electronic components such as the IC chip having different functions and to obtain a multilayer printed circuit board having a greater function. To be specific, a cache memory is embedded as the IC chip included in the board and an IC chip having an operation function is mounted on the front surface of the multilayer printed circuit board, whereby it is possible to arrange the IC chip and the cache memory in proximity while separately manufacturing the cache memory having low yield and the IC chip.Furthermore, after being devoted to the intensive studies, the inventor of the present invention devised providing opening portions, through holes and counterbore portions in resin insulating substrate to thereby contain an electronic component such as an IC chip in advance and forming a transition layer consisting of at least two-layer structure on the die pad of the IC chip. An interlayer insulating layer is provided on the transition layer and a via hole is provided on a via hole which is the transition layer of the IC chip by photo-etching or laser and a conductor circuit serving as a conductive layer. Thereafter, interlayer insulating layers and conductive layers are repeatedly built up and a multilayer printed circuit board is provided, thereby making it possible to electrically connect the multilayer printed circuit board to the IC chip without using a sealing resin and leads. Further, since the transition layer is formed on the IC chip portion, the IC % chip portion is flattened. Accordingly, the upper interlayer insulating layer is flattened and the thickness thereof becomes uniform. Further, the transition layer makes it possible to maintain the stability of a shape in case of forming the via hole on the upper layer.The reasons for providing the transition layer on the pad of the IC chip are as follows. First, if the die pad becomes fine pitch and small in size, alignment at the time of forming via holes becomes difficult. Due to this, by providing a transition layer, the alignment is facilitated. If the transition layer is provided, buildup layers can be stably formed even while a die pad pitch is 150 μm or less and a pad size is 20 μm or less. If the via hole is formed in the interlayer insulating layer with the die pad on which the transition layer is not formed and the diameter of the via is larger than the diameter of the die pad, then a polyimide layer serving as the protective layer of the surface of the die pad is dissolved and damaged at the time of removing the residue on the bottom of the via and roughening the surface of the interlayer resin insulating layer. On the other hand, if laser is applied and the via diameter is larder than the diameter of the die pad, a polyimide layer (or protective layer of the IC) is damaged by the laser. Moreover, if the die pad of the IC chip is very small and the diameter of the via is larger than the size of the die pad, then positioning becomes quite difficult even by photo-etching or laser and connection errors occur between the die pad and the via hole.By providing the transition layer on the die pad, by contrast, it is possible to ensure connecting the via on the die pad even with a die pad pitch of 150 μm or less and a pad size of 20 μm or less, thereby improving the connection between the pad and the via and reliability. In addition, by interposing the transition layer having a larger diameter on the pad of the IC chip, the fear that the protective film of die pad and the IC are dissolved and damaged if the protective film is immersed in an acid or an etching solution in later steps such as a de-smear and plating steps or conducting various annealing steps, is eliminated.The multilayer printed circuit board itself fulfils the functions. In some cases, BGA's, solder bumps or PGA's (conductive connection pins) may be provided to connect to a mother board or a daughter board which is an external board so as to function as a package substrate for a semiconductor device. With this constitution, wiring length and loop inductance can be reduced compared with a case of connecting the multilayer wiring board to the external board by a conventional mounting method.Now, the transition layer defined in the present invention will be described.The transition layer means a mediate layer provided on an intermediate portion so as to directly connect the IC chip, which is a semiconductor element, to the printed circuit board without using a conventional IC chip mounting technique. The transition layer is characterized by being formed out of two or more metallic layers or by being made larger than the die pad of the IC chip which is the semiconductor element. The transition layer thus characterized enables the enhancement of electrical connection and positioning characteristics and via hole processing by means of laser or photo-etching without damaging the die pad. This can ensure embedding and containing the IC chip in the printed circuit board, and connecting the IC chip to the printed circuit board. This also enables a metallic layer serving as the conductive layer of the printed circuit board to be directly formed on the transition layer. For example, the conductive layer is the via hole of the interlayer resin insulating layer or a through hole on the substrate.As a resin substrate for including electronic components such as the IC chip therein used in the present invention, a substrate obtained by building up prepregs impregnated with a resin or a glass epoxy resin obtained by impregnating an epoxy resin, a BT resin, a phenol resin or the like with a reinforcement or a core material such as a glass epoxy resin. An ordinary resin substrate used for the printed circuit board may be used. Alternatively, a double-sided copper-clad laminate, a one-sided plate, a resin plate without a metallic film or a resin film may be used. However, if the resin is heated at 350° C. or higher, the resin is dissolved and carbonated. Further, ceramic cannot be used for the substrate since it is inferior in outside workability.The IC chip is coupled to a resin insulating substrate such as a core substrate in which a cavity formed as a counterbore, a through hole or an opening for containing an electronic component such as the IC chip, by an adhesive or the like.The entire surface of the core substrate including the IC chip is subjected to deposition, sputtering or the like, thereby forming a conductive metallic film (or first thin film layer) on the entire surface. The metal used may be tin, chromium, titanium, nickel, zinc, cobalt, gold, copper or the like. The thickness of the conductive metallic film is preferably between 0.001 and 2.0 μm. If the thickness is smaller than 0.001 μm, the conductive metallic film cannot be provided uniformly on the entire surface. It is difficult to form a conductive metallic film having a thickness exceeding 2.0 μm and even if formed, the film does not improve advantages. The thickness is more preferably between 0.01 and 1.0 μm. If chromium is used, the thickness is preferably 0.1 μm.The first thin film layer covers the die pad, thereby making it possible to improve the adhesiveness of the transition layer and the IC chip to an interface with the die pad. Further, by covering the die pad with such a metal, it is possible to prevent the entry of moisture into the interface, to prevent the dissolution and erosion of the die pad and to improve reliability. In addition, the first thin film layer allows the connection between the multilayer printed circuit board and the IC chip by a mounting method without using leads. If using chromium, nickel or titanium, it is possible to prevent the entry of moisture into the interface and excellent metal adhesiveness is ensured. The thickness of chromium, titanium or the like is set so that the sputtered layer does not crack and that adhesiveness between the metal and the upper layer is ensured. With a reference to a positioning mark on the IC chip, a positioning mark is formed on the core substrate.The second thin film layer is formed on the first thin film layer by sputtering, deposition or electroless plating. The metal used is exemplified by nickel, copper, gold, silver or the like. It is preferable to use copper because it has appropriate electrical characteristic and is economical and a thickening layer formed in a later step mainly consists of copper.The reason for providing the second thin film layer is that only the first thin film layer cannot provide a electroplating lead to form a thickening layer to be described later. The second thin film layer  is employed as a thickening lead. The thickness of the second thin film is preferably 0.01 to 5 μm. If the thickness is smaller than 0.01 μm, the second thin film layer cannot function as a lead. If the thickness exceeds 5 μm, the lower first thin film layer is cut more than the second thin film layer to thereby generate gaps, moisture tends to enter the interference and reliability deteriorates during etching.The second thin film layer is thickened by electroless plating or electroplating. The type of a metal formed is exemplified by copper, nickel, gold, silver, zinc, iron or the like. It is preferable to use copper for electroplating because copper has appropriate electrical characteristic, is economical, has the strength and structural resistance of the transition layer and a conductor layer to be build up in a later step mainly consists of copper. The thickness of the second thin film layer is preferably 1 to 20 μm. If the thickness is smaller than 1 μm, the connection reliability of the layer with the upper via hole deteriorates. If the thickness exceeds 20 μm, undercut occurs during etching and thereby gaps are generated in the interface between the formed transition layer and the via hole. In some cases, the first thin film layer may be directly plated to thicken the layer or multiple layers may be provided.Thereafter, an etching resist is formed with reference to the positioning mark on the core substrate, exposure and development are performed to expose the portions of the metal other than that of the transition layer and etching is then performed, thereby forming a transition layer consisting of the first thin film layer, the second thin film layer and a thickening layer on the die pad of the IC chip.In case of forming a transition layer by a subtractive process, a metallic film is thickened by electroless plating or electroplating. The type of the plated member to be formed is exemplified by copper, nickel, gold, silver, zinc, iron or the like. It is preferable to use copper because copper has appropriate electrical characteristic and is economical and a buildup conductive layer to be formed later mainly consists of copper. The thickness is preferably in the range of 1 to 20 μm. If the thickness exceeds the range, undercut occurs during etching and gaps may be generated in the interface between the transition layer and the via hole to be formed. Thereafter, an etching resist is formed, exposure and development are performed to the portion of the metal other than that of the transition layer, thereby forming a transition layer on the pad of the IC chip.As stated above, the inventors of the present invention devised including an IC chip in a package substrate by containing the IC chip in a recess formed in the core substrate and building up an interlayer resin insulating layer and a conductive circuit on the core substrate.According to this method, a metallic film is formed on the entire surface of the core substrate containing the IC chip so as to cover or protect the pad of the IC chip, or, in some cases, forming a transition layer on the pad, thereby electrically connecting the pad to the via hole of the interlayer resin insulating layer.However, since the metallic film is formed on the entire surface, a positioning mark formed on the IC chip is concealed and a mask on which wirings are drawn or a laser device cannot be positioned relative to the substrate. Due to this, it is estimated that a positional error occurs between the pad on the IC chip and the via hole and that electrical connection cannot be established between the pad and the via hole.The present invention has been made to solve the above-stated problems. It is another object of the present invention to propose a method of a multilayer printed circuit board manufacturing method capable of being appropriately connected to an IC chip included in the multilayer printed circuit board.According to claim , a method of manufacturing a multilayer printed circuit board having interlayer insulating layers and conductor layers repeatedly formed on a substrate, via holes formed in the interlayer insulating layers, and establishing electrical connection through the via holes, is characterized by comprising at least the following steps (a) to (c):(a) containing an electronic component in said substrate;\n\n(b) forming a positioning mark on said substrate based on a positioning mark of said electronic component; and\n\n(c) conducting working or formation based on the positioning mark of said substrate.According to claim , a positioning mark is formed on a substrate containing an electronic component therein based on the positioning mark of the electronic component, and working or formation is conducted based on the positioning mark of the substrate. Due to this, it is possible to form a via hole in an interlayer resin insulating layer on the substrate so as to accurately match the position of the via hole to the position of the electronic component.Working in this case means the IC chip which is the electronic component or all that formed on the substrate. For example, a transition layer on the pad of the IC chip, a recognized character (e.g., an alphabet, number or the like), a positioning mark are included.Also, formation in this case means all that formed on the interlayer resin insulating layer (which does not contain a reinforcement such as glass cloths) provided on the core substrate. For example, a via hole, a wiring, a recognized character (e.g., an alphabet, number or the like), a positioning mark and the like are included.According to claim , a method of manufacturing a multilayer printed circuit board having interlayer insulating layers and conductor layers repeatedly formed on a substrate, via holes formed in the interlayer insulating layers, and establishing electrical connection through the via holes, is characterized by comprising at least the following steps (a) to (d):(a) containing an electronic component in said substrate;\n\n(b) forming a positioning mark on said substrate based on a positioning mark of said electronic component by using laser;\n\n(c) forming a metallic film on the positioning mark of said substrate; and\n\n(d) conducting working or formation based on the positioning mark of said substrate.According to claim , a positioning mark is provided on a substrate containing an electronic component therein by laser based on the positioning mark of the electronic component, working or formation is conducted based on the positioning mark of the substrate after forming a metallic film on the positioning mark provided by laser. Due to this, it is possible to form a via hole in the interlayer insulating layer on the substrate so as to accurately match the position of the via hole to the position of the electronic component. In addition, since the metallic film is formed on the positioning mark provided by laser, it is possible to easily recognize the positioning mark by a reflection method and to conduct accurate positioning.According to claim , a method of manufacturing a multilayer printed circuit board having interlayer insulating layers and conductor layers repeatedly formed on a substrate, via holes formed in the interlayer insulating layers, and establishing electrical connection through the via holes, is characterized by comprising at least the following steps (a) to (e):(a) containing an electronic component in said substrate;\n\n(b) forming a positioning mark on said substrate based on a positioning mark of said electronic component by using laser;\n\n(c) forming a metallic film on the positioning mark of said substrate;\n\n(d) forming the interlayer insulating layers on said substrate; and\n\n(e) processing or forming via hole openings in said interlayer resin insulating layers based on the positioning mark of said substrate.According to claim , a positioning mark is formed on a substrate containing an electronic component therein based on the positioning mark of the electronic component, working or formation is conducted based on the positioning mark of the substrate after forming a metallic film on the positioning mark. Due to this, it is possible to form a via hole in an interlayer insulating layer on the substrate so as to accurately match the position of the via hole to the position of the electronic component. In addition, the metallic film is formed on the positioning mark provided by laser. Due to this, even if an interlayer insulating layer is formed on the positioning mark, the positioning mark can be easily recognized and accurate positioning can be conducted by recognizing an image by a reflection method.As described above, the inventor of the present invention devised a structure capable of establishing electrical connection between a multilayer printed circuit board and an IC chip without using a sealing resin, leads or bumps by providing an opening portion, a through hole or a counterbore portion in a resin insulating substrate to include an electronic component such as an IC chip therein, building up interlayer resin insulating layers, providing a via on the pad of the IC chip by photo-etching or laser, forming a conductor circuit serving as a conductive layer, repeatedly providing the interlayer insulating layers and the conductive layers and thereby forming the multilayer printed circuit board.However, since the pad of the IC chip is normally formed out of aluminum or the like, the pad is oxidized in manufacturing steps and an oxide film is formed on the surface of the pad. Due to this, it was discovered, the oxide film formed on the surface causes an increase in the connection resistance of the pad and, the multilayer printed circuit board cannot be appropriately electrically connected to the IC chip. It was also discovered that if an oxide film remains on the die pad, the adhesiveness between the pad and the transition layer becomes insufficient and reliability cannot be satisfied.The present invention has been made to solve the above-stated problems. It is a still further object of the present invention to propose a multilayer printed circuit board capable of being appropriately electrically connected to an IC chip without leads and a method of manufacturing the multilayer printed circuit board.According to claim , in order to achieve the above purpose, a method of manufacturing a multilayer printed circuit board is characterized by comprising at least the following steps (a) to (e):(a) containing an electronic component in said substrate;\n\n(b) removing a film on a surface of a die pad of said electronic component;\n\n(c) forming a transition layer to be connected to a via hole of a lowermost interlayer insulating layer, on said die pad;\n\n(d) forming the interlayer insulating layers on said substrate; and\n\n(e) forming the via holes connected to the conductor circuits and the transition layers, in said interlayer resin insulating layers.According to claim , since an IC chip is contained in a substrate, the multilayer printed circuit board can be electrically connected to the IC chip without leads. Besides, an oxide film removal process is conducted to the connection surface of the die pad of an electronic component such as an IC chip, it is possible to reduce the electrical resistance of the die pad and to improve electrical conductivity thereof. Further, by proving a transition layer on an IC chip portion, the IC chip portion is flattened. Due to this, the interlayer insulating layer on the IC chip is also flattened and film thickness becomes uniform. Furthermore, if a via hole on an upper layer is formed, it is possible to maintain the stability of shape. It is preferable that the film is completely removed.According to claim , by completely removing the oxide film by one of inverse sputtering and a plasma process, it is possible to improve the electrical conductivity of the die pad of the IC chip.In case of inverse sputtering, inactive gas such as argon gas is used as sputtering gas and inverse sputtering is conducted to the oxide film on the surface of the die pad, thereby completely removing the oxide film. In case of the plasma process, the substrate is put in a device in a vacuum state, plasmas are discharged in oxygen or nitrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon tetrafluoride to thereby remove the oxide film on the surface of the die pad.According to claim , the film removal and the formation of the lower most layer of the transition layer are conducted under a non-oxygen atmosphere in succession. Due to this, it is possible to improve the electrical conductivity and adhesiveness between the die pad of the IC chip and the transition layer without forming an oxide film on the surface of the pad again.According to claim , a multilayer printed circuit board having interlayer insulating layers and conductor layers repeatedly formed on a substrate, via holes formed in the interlayer insulating layers, and establishing electrical connection through the via holes, is characterized in thatan electronic component is included in said substrate;a transition layer to be connected to a via hole of a lowermost interlayer insulating layer is formed on a die pad of said electronic component; anda film on a surface of said die pad is removed.According to claim , since the IC chip is contained in the substrate, the multilayer printed circuit board can be electrically connected to the IC chip without leads. Further, since an oxide film removal process is conducted to the connection surface of the die pad of an electronic component such as an IC chip, it is possible to reduce the electrical resistance of the die pad and improve the electrical conductivity thereof. Further, by providing the transition layer on the IC chip portion, the IC chip portion is flattened. Due to this, the interlayer insulating layer on the IC chip is also flattened and film thickness becomes uniform. In addition, even if a via hole on the upper layer is formed, it is possible to maintain the stability of shape. It is preferable that the film is completely removed.The embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the drawings.First, the constitution of a multilayer printed circuit board according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to  showing the cross-sectional view of a multilayer printed circuit board .As shown in , the multilayer printed circuit board  consists of a core substrate  containing therein an IC chip , an interlayer resin insulating layer  and an interlayer resin insulating layer . Via holes  and conductor circuits  are formed on the interlayer resin insulating layer . Via holes  and conductor circuits  are formed on the interlayer resin insulating layer .The IC chip  is covered with a passivation film  and die pads  each constituting an input/output terminal are provided in the openings of the passivation film . A transition layer  is formed on each die pad  made of aluminum. The transition layer  consists of three layers of the first thin film layer , the second thin film layer  and a thickening layer .A solder resist layer  is provided on the interlayer resin insulating layer . BGA's  for connecting to an external substrate such as a daughter board or a mother board which is not shown in  are provided on the conductor circuits  under the openings  of the solder resist layer , respectively.In the multilayer printed circuit board  in the first embodiment, the IC chip  is included in the core substrate  in advance and the transition layer  is provided on each die pad  of the IC chip . Due to this, it is possible to electrically connect the IC chip to the multilayer printed circuit board (or package substrate) without using lead members and a sealing resin. Further, since the transition layers  are formed on the IC chip portion, the IC chip portion is flattened and the upper interlayer insulating layer  is, therefore, flattened to thereby provide uniform film thickness. Further, because of the transition layers, it is possible to maintain the stability of shape even if the via holes  provided in the upper layer are formed.Furthermore, by providing the transition layers  made of copper on the respective die pads , it is possible to prevent resin residues on the die pads  and to prevent the die pads  from being discolored or dissolved even after impregnating the multilayer printed circuit board in an acid, an oxidizer or an etching solution in a later step or conducting various annealing steps. Thus, connection characteristic between the die pads of the IC chip and the via holes and reliability can be improved. Furthermore, by interposing the transition layers  each having a diameter of 60 μm or more on the respective die pads  each having a diameter of about 40 μm, it is possible to ensure connecting the via holes each having a diameter of 60 μm or more.Next, a method of manufacturing the multilayer printed circuit board described above with reference to  will be described with reference to .(1) First, an insulating resin substrate (or core substrate)  in which prepregs each having a core material made of glass cloths or the like and impregnated with a resin such as epoxy are built up, is used as a starting material (see ). Next, a recess  for containing an IC chip is formed on one side of the core substrate  by counter boring (see . While the recess is provided by counter boring herein, it is also possible to from a core substrate having a containing section by laminating an insulating resin substrate having an opening portion and an insulating resin substrate without an opening.\n\n(2) Then, an adhesive material  is applied to the recess  using a printing machine. At this time, potting instead of application may be conducted. Next, an IC chip  is mounted on the adhesive material  (see ).\n\n(3) Then, the upper surface of the IC chip  is depressed or struck to thereby completely contain the IC chip  in the recess  (see . By doing so, the core substrate  can be smoothed.\n\n(4) Thereafter, the entire surface of the core substrate  which contains the IC chip  therein is subjected to deposition or sputtering to form the conductive, first thin film layer  on the entire surface (). A metal used may be tin, chromium, titanium, nickel, zinc, cobalt, gold or copper. Nickel, chromium or titanium is more preferable because it is capable of suppressing the entry of moisture into an interface, appropriate for film formation and in electrical characteristic. The thickness of the first thin film layer  is preferably 0.001 to 2.0 μm, more preferably, 0.01 to 1.0 μm. In case of chromium, the thickness is preferably 0.1 μm.The die pad  is covered with the first thin film layer , thereby making it possible to improve the adhesiveness of the transition layer and the IC chip to the interface with the die pad . Also, by covering the die pad  with the metal, it is possible to prevent moisture from entering the interference, to prevent the dissolution and erosion of the die pad and to improve reliability. Further, the first thin film layer  allows the die pad to connect with the IC chip by a mounting method without using a lead. Here, if chromium, titanium or nickel is used, it is possible to prevent the entry of moisture into the interference and to ensure high metal adhesiveness.(5) The second thin film layer  is formed on the first thin film layer  by sputtering, deposition or electroless plating (). A metal used herein may be nickel, copper, gold or silver. Copper is preferable because the copper has good electrical characteristic and is economical and because a buildup conductor layer to be formed in a later step mainly consists of copper.The reason for providing the second thin film layer is that an electroplating lead for forming a thickening layer to be described later cannot be provided only with the first thin film layer. The second thin film layer  is used as a lead for thickening and preferably 0.01 to 5 in thickness. The thickness is more preferably 0.1 to 3 μm. The second thin film layer having such a thickness is optimum to cover the first thin film and serve as a lead. If the thickness is less than 0.01 μm, the second thin film layer cannot function as a lead. If the thickness exceeds 5 μm, the first thin film layer under the second thin film layer is cut more than the second thin film layer and gaps are generated between the first and second thin film layers during etching. This makes the entry of moisture easier and deteriorates reliability.A preferable combination of the first and second thin film layer is chromium-copper, chromium-nickel, titanium-copper, titanium-nickel or the like. These combinations are superior to the other combinations in view of junction with a metal and electrical conductivity.(6) Thereafter, a resist is applied, exposure and development are conducted to provide a plated resist  while provide an opening on the upper portion of the die pad of the IC chip, and electroplating is conducted under the following conditions to thereby provide an electroplated film (or thickening film)  ().[Electroplating Solution][Electroplating Conditions]After removing the plating resist , the electroless-plated, second thin film layer  and first thin film layer  under the plating resist  are etched away, thereby forming a transition layer  on each of the die pads  of the IC chip (). The transition layer is formed by the plating resist in this case. Alternatively, the transition layer may be formed on each die pad by after uniformly forming an electroless-plated film on the electroless-plated, second thin film layer , forming an etching resist, conducting exposure and development to expose the metal other than that of the transition layer, and conducting etching. The thickness of the electroplated film is preferably in the range of 1 to 20 μm. If the thickness exceeds the range, undercut may possibly occur during the etching to generate gaps in the interface between the transition layer to be formed and the via hole.(7) Next, an etching solution is sprayed onto the substrate and the surface of the transition layer  is etched, thereby forming a rough surface α (see ). The rough surface can be also formed by electroless plating or an oxidization-reduction process.  is an enlarged view of the transition layer  shown in .  is a view seen from B of . The transition layer  is a three-layer structure consisting of the first thin film layer , the second thin film layer  and the thickening layer . As shown in , the transition is formed to be circular. It is also possible to form the transition layer to be not circular but ellipsoidal as shown in , rectangular as shown in  or oval as shown in .\n\n(8) A thermosetting resin sheet having a thickness of 50 μm is vacuum-compression laminated onto the substrate which has gone through the above-stated steps at a pressure of 5 kg/cmwhile raising temperature to 50 to 150° C., thereby providing an interlayer resin insulating layer  (see ). The degree of vacuum at the time of vacuum compression is 10 mmHg.\n\n(9) Next, using COgas laser having a wavelength of 10.4 μm, via hole openings  each having a diameter of 80 μm are provided in the interlayer resin insulating layer  under the conditions of a beam diameter of 5 mm, a top hat mode, a pulse width of 5.0 μm, a mask hole diameter of 0.5 mm and one shot (see ). Using a chromium acid, resin residues in the openings  are removed. By providing the transition layer  made of copper on each die pad , it is possible to prevent resin residues on the die pad , thereby improving connection characteristic between the die pad  and a via hole  to be described later and improving reliability. Furthermore, by interposing the transition layer  having a diameter of 60 μm or more on the die pad  having a diameter of about 40 μm, it is possible to ensure connecting the via hole opening  having a diameter of 60 μm. While the resin residues are removed by using a permanganic acid, a de-smear process can be also conducted using oxygen plasma.\n\n(10) Next, the resultant substrate is immersed in an oxidizer such as a chromic acid or a permanganic acid or the like, thereby providing a rough surface α on the interlayer resin insulating layer  (see ). The rough surface α is preferably formed in the range of 0.05 to 5 μm. For example, the substrate is immersed in 50 g/l of a sodium permanganate solution at a temperature of 60° C. for 5 to 25 minutes, thereby providing a rough surface α of 1 to 5 μm. Alternatively, by performing a plasma process using SV-4540 manufactured by ULVAC JAPAN Ltd., the rough surface α can be formed on the interlayer resin insulating layer . In that case, argon gas is used as inactive gas to perform a plasma process for two minutes under conditions of electric power of 200 W, a gas pressure of 0.6 Pa and a temperature of 70° C.\n\n(11) A metallic layer  is provided on the interlayer resin insulating layer  on which the rough surface α is formed (see ). The metallic layer  is formed by electroless plating. By supplying a catalyst such as a palladium catalyst to the surface layer of the interlayer resin insulating layer  in advance and immersing the substrate into an electroless plating solution for 5 to 60 minutes, the metallic layer  which is a plated film in the range of 0.1 to 5 μm is provided. For example, the substrate was immersed in the following solution at a solution temperature of 34° C. for 40 minutes:[Electroless Plating Solution]Alternatively, an Ni/Cu metallic layer  can be formed on the surface of the interlayer resin insulating layer  by exchanging internal argon gas and then conducting sputtering with and Cu as targets under conditions of an air pressure of 0.6 Pa, a temperature of 80° C., power of 200 W and a duration of five minutes with the same device as that used for the above-stated plasma process. At this time, the thickness of an Ni/Cu metallic layer  formed is 0.2 μm. Alternatively, the metallic film can be formed by deposition, electrodeposition or the like instead of sputtering. It is also possible to form a thin layer by a physical method such as sputtering, deposition or electrodeposition and then to conduct electroless plating.(12) A commercially available photosensitive dry film is bonded to the substrate  which has been subjected to the above process, a chromium glass mask is mounted, exposure is performed at 40 mj/cmand then a development process is conducted with 0.8% sodium carbonate, thereby providing plating resists  each having a thickness of 25 μm (see ). Next, electroplating is conducted under the following conditions to form an electroplated film  having a thickness of 18 μm. An additive in the electroplating solution is Kapalacid HL manufactured by Atotech Japan.[Electroplating Solution][Electro Plating Conditions](13) After separating and removing the plating resist  with 5% NaOH, the metallic layer  under the plating resist is dissolved and removed by etching using a mixture solution of an nitric acid and oxygenated water, conductor circuits  each consisting of the metallic layer  and the electroplated film  and having a thickness of 16 μm and via holes  are formed and etched by an etching solution containing a cupric salt complex and an organic acid, thereby forming rough surfaces α and α (see ). Alternatively, the rough surfaces can be formed by electroless plating or an oxidization-reduction process.\n\n(14) Next, the steps of (9) to (13) stated above are repeated, thereby forming an upper interlayer resin insulating layer  and conductor circuits  (include via holes ) (see ).\n\n(15) Then, 46.67 parts by weight of oligomer (having a molecular weight of 4000) which is obtained by forming 50% of epoxy groups of 60 parts by weight of a cresol novolac epoxy resin (manufactured by Nippon Kayaku) dissolved in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DMDG) into an acrylic structure and which imparts photosensitive characteristic, 15 parts by weight of 80 wt % of a bisphenol A epoxy resin (product name: Epicoat 1001 manufactured by Yuka Shell) dissolved in methylethyl keton, 1.6 parts by weight of an imidazole hardening agent (product name: 2E4MZ-CN manufactured by Shikoku Chemicals), 3 parts by weight of polyhydric acryl monomer which is a photosensitive monomer (product name: R604 manufactured by Kyoei Chemical), 1.5 parts by weight of polyhydric acryl monomer (product name: DPE6A manufactured by Kyoei Chemical), and 0.71 parts by weight of a dispersing defoaming agent (product name: S-65 manufactured by Sannopuko) are contained in a container, agitated and mixed to adjust mixture compositions. Then, 2.0 parts by weight of benzophenone (manufactured by Kanto Chemical) serving as a photoinitiator and 0.2 parts by weight of Michler's ketone (manufactured by Kanto Chemical) serving as a photosensitizer are added to the mixture compositions, thereby obtaining a solder resist composition (or organic resin insulating material) adjusted to have a viscosity of 2.0 Pa·s.Note that the viscosity is measured by using No. 4 rotor of a B-type viscometer (DVL-B manufactured by Tokyo Keiki) when the velocity is 60 rpm and using No. 3 rotor of the same when the velocity is 6 rpm.(16) Next, the solder resist composition is applied to the substrate  to have a thickness of 20 μm and a drying process is conducted at 70° C. for 20 minutes and 70° C. for 30 minutes. Then, a photomask film having a pattern of the solder resist opening portions drawn thereon and a thickness of 5 mm is made hermetic contact with the solder resist layer , exposure is performed with ultraviolet rays with 1000 mj/cmand then a development process is performed with a DMTG solution, thereby forming openings  each having a land diameter of 620 μm and an opening diameter of 460 μm (see ).\n\n(17) Next, the substrate on which the solder resist layer (or organic resin insulating layer)  is formed, is immersed in an electroless nickel plating solution containing nickel chloride (2.3×10mol/l), sodium hypophosphite (2.8×10mol/l), sodium citrate (1.6×10mol/l) and having pH=4.5 for 20 minutes, and a nickel plate layer  having a thickness of 5 μm is formed on each opening portion . Then, the substrate is further immersed in an electroless plating solution containing gold potassium cyanide (7.6×10mol/l), ammonia chloride (1.9×10mol/l), sodium citrate (1.2×10mol/l) and sodium hypophosphite (1.7×10mol/l) under the condition of 80° C. for 7.5 minutes and a gold plated layer  having a thickness of 0.03 μm is formed on the nickel plated layer , thereby forming a solder pad  on each conductor layer  (see ).\n\n(18) Thereafter, a solder paste is printed on the opening portion  of the solder resist layer  and reflowed at 200′C, thereby forming a BGA's . As a result, it is possible to obtain a multilayer printed circuit board  including the IC chip  and having the BGA's  (see FIG. ). Instead of the BGA's, PGA (conductive contact pins) may be arranged.In the above-stated embodiment, the thermosetting resin sheet is used for the interlayer resin insulating layers  and . The thermosetting resin insulating sheet contains a refractory resin, soluble particles, a hardening agent and other components. The materials will now be described one by one.The epoxy resin which can be used in the thermosetting resin sheet in the first embodiment has a structure that particles soluble in an acid or an oxidizer (to be referred to as “soluble particles” hereinafter) are dispersed in a resin which is refractory with respect to an acid or an oxidizer (to be referred to as “refractory resin” hereinafter). The expressions “refractory” and “soluble” are used as follows. When materials are immersed in a solution composed of the same acid or the same oxidizer for the same time, a material of a type which is dissolved at a relatively high dissolving rate is called a “soluble” material and a material of a type which is dissolved at a relatively slow dissolving rate is called “refractory material” for convenience.The soluble particles are exemplified by resin particles which are soluble in an acid or an oxidizer (to be referred to as “soluble resin particles” hereinafter), inorganic particles which are soluble in an acid or an oxidizer (to be referred to as “inorganic soluble particles” hereinafter), metal particles which are soluble in an acid or an oxidizer (to be referred to as “soluble metal particles” hereinafter) and the like. The foregoing soluble particles may be employed solely or two or more particles may be mixed.The shape of each of the soluble particles is not limited. The shape may be a spherical shape or a pulverized shape. It is preferable that the soluble particles have a uniform shape. The reason for this lies in that a rough surface having uniformly rough pits and projections can be formed.It is preferable that the mean particle size of the soluble particles is 0.1 μm to 10 μm. When the particles have the diameters satisfying the foregoing range, two or more particles having different particle sizes may be employed. That is, soluble particles having a mean particle size of 0.1 μm to 0.5 μm and soluble particles having a mean particle size of 1 μm to 3 μm may be mixed. Thus, a more complicated rough surface can be formed. Moreover, the adhesiveness with the conductor circuit can be improved. In the first embodiment, the particle size of the soluble particles is the length of a longest portion of each of the soluble particles.The soluble resin particles are exemplified by particles constituted by a thermosetting resin or a thermoplastic resin. When the particles are immersed in solution composed of an acid or an oxidizer, the particles must exhibit dissolving rate higher than that of the foregoing refractory resin.Specifically, the soluble resin particles are exemplified by particles constituted by an epoxy resin, a phenol resin, a polyimide resin, a polyphenylene resin, a polyolefin resin or a fluorine resin. The foregoing material may be employed solely or two or more materials may be mixed.The soluble resin particles may exemplified by resin particles constituted by rubber. The rubber above is exemplified by polybutadiene rubber, a variety of denatured polybutadiene rubber, such as denatured epoxy rubber, denatured urethane rubber or denatured (meta) acrylonitrile rubber, and (meta) acrylonitrile butadiene rubber containing a carboxylic group. When the foregoing rubber material is employed, the soluble resin particles can easily be dissolved in an acid or an oxidizer. That is, when the soluble resin particles are dissolved with an acid, dissolution is permitted with an acid other than a strong acid, and when dissolved with an oxidizer, dissolution is permitted with permanganate which has a relatively weak oxidizing power. When chromic acid is employed, dissolution is permitted even at a low concentration. Therefore, the retention of the acid or the oxidizer on the surface of the resin can be prevented. When a catalyst, such as palladium chloride, is supplied after the rough surface has been formed as described later, the inhibition of supply of the catalyst and the oxidation of the catalyst can be prevented.The inorganic soluble particles are exemplified by particles made of at least a material selected from a group consisting of an aluminum compound, a calcium compound, a potassium compound, a magnesium compound and a silicon compound.The aluminum compound is exemplified by alumina, aluminum hydroxide and the like. The calcium compound is exemplified by calcium carbonate, calcium hydroxide and the like. The potassium compound is exemplified by potassium carbonate and the like. The magnesium compound is exemplified by magnesia, dolomite, basic magnesium carbonate and the like. The silicon compound is exemplified by silica, zeolite and the like. The foregoing material may be employed solely or two or more materials may be mixed.The soluble metal particles are exemplified by particles constituted by at least one material selected from a group consisting of copper, nickel, iron, zinc, lead, gold, silver, aluminum, magnesium, potassium and silicon. The soluble metal particles may have surfaces coated with a resin or the like in order to maintain insulating characteristic.When two or more types of the soluble particles are mixed, it is preferable that the combination of the two types of soluble particles is a combination of resin particles and inorganic particles. Since each of the particles has low electric conductivity, insulating characteristic with the resin film can be maintained. Moreover, the thermal expansion can easily be adjusted with the refractory resin. Thus, the occurrence of a crack on the interlayer resin insulating layer constituted by the resin film can be prevented. The separation between the interlayer resin insulating layer and the conductor circuit can be prevented.The refractory resin is not limited when the resin is able to maintain the shape of the rough surface when the rough surface is formed on the interlayer resin insulating layer by using an acid or an oxidizer. For example, the refractory resin is exemplified by a thermosetting resin, a thermoplastic resin and their composite material. As an alternative to this, the foregoing photosensitive resin of a type having photosensitive characteristics imparted thereto may be employed. When the photosensitive resin is employed, exposure and development processes can be performed to of the interlayer rein insulating layers to thereby form openings for the via holes.In particular, it is preferable that the resin containing a thermosetting resin is employed. In the foregoing case, the shape of the rough surface can be maintained against a plating solution and when a variety of heating processes are performed.The refractory resin is exemplified by an epoxy resin, a phenol resin, a phenoxy resin, a polyimide resin, a polyphenylene resin, a polyolefin resin, a fluorine resin and the like. The foregoing material may be employed solely or two or more types of the materials may be mixed. A thermosetting resin, a thermoplastic resin or a complex thereof may be employed.It is preferable that an epoxy resin having two or more epoxy groups in one molecule thereof is employed. The reason for this lies in that the foregoing rough surface can be formed. Moreover, excellent heat resistance and the like can be obtained. Thus, the concentration of a stress onto the metallic layer can be prevented even under a heat cycle condition. Thus, the occurrence of separation of the metallic layer can be prevented.The epoxy resin is exemplified by a cresol novolac epoxy resin, a bisphenol-A epoxy resin, a bisphenol-F epoxy resin, a phenol novolac epoxy resin, an alkylphenol novolac epoxy resin, a biphenol-F epoxy resin, a naphthalene epoxy resin, a dicyclopentadiene epoxy resin, an epoxy material constituted by a condensation material of phenol and an aromatic aldehyde having a phenol hydroxyl group, triglycidyl isocyanurate and alicyclic epoxy resin. The foregoing material may be employed solely or two or more material may be mixed. Thus, excellent heat resistance can be obtained.It is preferable that the soluble particles in the resin film used in the first embodiment are substantially uniformly dispersed in the refractory resin. The reason for this lies in that a rough surface having uniform pits and projections can be formed. When via holes and through holes are formed in the resin film, adhesiveness with the metallic layer of the conductor circuit can be maintained. As an alternative to this, a resin film containing soluble particles in only the surface layer on which the rough surface is formed may be employed. Thus, the portions of the resin film except for the surface layer is not exposed to an acid or an oxidizer. Therefore, the insulating characteristic between conductor circuits through the interlayer resin insulating layers can reliably be maintained.It is preferable that the amount of the soluble particles which are dispersed in the refractory resin is 3 wt % to 40 wt % with respect to the resin film. When the amount of mixture of the soluble particles is lower than 3 wt %, the rough surface having required pits and projections cannot be formed. When the amount is higher than 40 wt %, the deep portions of the resin film are undesirably dissolved when the soluble particles are dissolved by using an acid or an oxidizer. Thus, the insulating layer constituted by the resin film cannot be maintained. This sometimes causes short circuit.It is preferable that the resin film contains a hardening agent and other components as well as the refractory resin.The hardening agent is exemplified by an imidazole hardening agent, an amino hardening agent, a guanidine hardening agent, an epoxy adduct of each of the foregoing hardening agents, a microcapsule of each of the foregoing hardening agents and an organic phosphine compound such as triphenylphosphine or tetraphenyl phosphonium tetraphenyl borate.It is preferable that the content of the hardening agent is 0.05 wt % to 10 wt % in the resin film. If the content is lower than 0.05 wt %, the resin film cannot sufficiently be hardened. Thus, the introduction of the acid and the oxidizer into the resin film occurs more frequently and the insulating characteristic of the resin film sometimes deteriorates. When the content is higher than 10 wt %, an excessively large quantity of the hardening agent component sometimes denatures the composition of the resin and the reliability sometimes deteriorates.The other components are exemplified by an inorganic compound which does not exert an influence on the formation of the rough surface and a filler such as a resin. The inorganic compound is exemplified by silica, alumina, dolomite and the like. The resin is exemplified by a polyimide resin, a polyacrylic resin, a polyamideimide resin, a polyphenylene resin, a melanine resin, an olefin resin and the like. If any one of the foregoing fillers is contained, then the conformity of thermal expansion coefficients can be established and heat resistance, chemical resistance can be improved and the performance of the multilayer printed circuit board can be thereby improved.The resin film may contain a solvent. The solvent is exemplified by ketone such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or cyclohexane, aromatic hydrocarbon such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, cellosolve acetate, toluene or xylene. The foregoing material may be employed solely or two or more materials may be mixed. However, the interlayer resin insulating layers made from the foregoing materials are dissolved and carbonated at a temperature of 350° C. or higher.After bonding the resin film, the film is opened by laser and via holes are formed in the interlayer resin insulating layers. Thereafter, the substrate is immersed in an acid or an oxidizer to thereby form rough surfaces on the interlayer resin insulating layers. The acid is exemplified by an strong acid such as a sulfuric acid, a phosphoric acid, a hydrochloric acid or a formic acid. The oxidizer is exemplified by a chromic acid, a mixture of chromium and a sulfuric acid, permanganate and the like. Soluble particles are dissolved or separated using the acid or oxidizer, thereby forming rough surfaces on the interlayer resin insulating layers. A catalyst such as Pb is supplied to the interlayer resin insulating layers on which the rough layers are formed, and then electroless plating is performed. Plating resist unformed regions are formed by providing a resist on the electroless plated film and conducting exposure and development. The regions are electroplated, the resist is separated, and the electroplated films on the interlayer resin insulating layers are removed by etching, thereby forming via holes and conductor circuits.is a perspective view of the multilayer printed circuit board  according to the first embodiment.  is an explanatory view showing the multilayer printed circuit board  which is partly enlarged. Semiconductor bumps (ball-grid arrays)  are provided in a hound's tooth manner on the entire surface of the multilayer printed circuit board . In the first embodiment, by forming the BGA's  on the IC chip , it is possible to shorten the lengths of wirings from the IC chip .is a perspective view of a multilayer printed circuit board  according to the first modification of the first embodiment.  is an explanatory view showing the multilayer printed circuit board  which is partly enlarged in the modification. Semiconductor bumps (ball-grid arrays)  are provided in a hound's tooth manner on the surface of the multilayer printed circuit board  in all corners except for the portion on the IC chip . In this modification, by avoiding forming the bumps  on the IC chip , it is made advantageously difficult for the BGA's  to be thermally and electromagnetically influenced by the IC chip.Next, description will be given to a multilayer printed circuit board according to the second modification of the first embodiment with reference to . In the first embodiment stated above, description has been given to a case where the BGA's are arranged. In the second modification, which is almost the same as the first embodiment, the multilayer printed circuit board is constituted in a PGA mode for establishing connection through conductive connection pins  as shown in .Next, description will be given to a multilayer printed circuit board according to the third modification of the first embodiment with reference to .In the first embodiment stated above, the IC chip is contained in the recess  provided in the core substrate  by counter boring. In the third modification, by contrast, an IC chip  is contained in a through hole  formed in the core substrate . In this third modification, a heat sink can be directly attached to the rear surface side of the IC chip , so that it is advantageous that the IC chip  can be cooled efficiently.Next, a multilayer printed circuit board in the fourth modification of the first embodiment will be described with reference to .In the first embodiment stated above, the IC chip is contained in the multilayer printed circuit board. In the fourth modification as shown at , by contrast, an IC chip , as the first electronic component, is contained in the multilayer printed circuit board and a second electronic component as IC chip  is mounted on the surface of the multilayer printed circuit board. As the IC chip  included in the layer, a cache memory having a relatively low calorific value is employed. As the IC chip  mounted on the surface, a CPU for arithmetic operation is employed.The die pads  of the IC chip  and the die pads  of the IC chip  are mutually connected through transition layers —via holes —conductor circuits—via holes —conductor circuit —BGA's U, respectively. On the other hand, the die pads  of the IC chip  and the pads  of a daughter board  are mutually connected through BGA's U—conductor circuits —via holes —conductor circuits —via holes —through holes —via holes —conductor circuits —via holes —conductor circuits —BGA's U, respectively.In the fourth modification, it is possible to arrange the IC chip  and the cache memory  in proximity while separately manufacturing the cache memory  having low yield and the IC chip  for the CPU, and to operate the IC chips at high speed. In this fourth modification, by including an IC chip in the multilayer printed circuit board and, at the same time, mounting an IC chip on the surface thereof, it is possible to package electronic components such as IC chips having different functions and to thereby obtain a multilayer printed circuit board having greater functions.With the structure of the first embodiment, the IC chip and the printed circuit board can be connected to each other without using lead members. Due to this, resin sealing becomes unnecessary. Furthermore, since no defects resulting from the lead members and sealing resin occur, connection characteristic and reliability are improved. Besides, since the die pads of the IC chip are directly connected to the conductive layers of the printed circuit board, it is possible to improve electrical characteristic.Moreover, compared with the conventional IC chip mounting method, the wiring length from the IC chip to the substrate to the external substrate can be advantageously shortened and loop inductance can be advantageously reduced.Next, the constitution of a multilayer printed circuit boar according to the second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to  showing the cross-section of a multilayer printed circuit board .As shown in , the multilayer printed circuit board  consists of a core substrate  containing therein an IC chip , an interlayer resin insulating layer  and an interlayer resin insulating layer . Via holes  and conductor circuits  are formed on the interlayer resin insulating layer . Via holes  and conductor circuits  are formed on the interlayer resin insulating layer .The IC chip  is covered with a passivation film , and die pads  each constituting an input/output terminal and positioning marks  are provided in the respective openings of the passivation film . A transition layer  mainly consisting of copper is formed on each die pad .A solder resist layer  is provided on the interlayer resin insulating layer . BGA's  for connecting to an external substrate, such as a daughter board or a mother board which is not shown, are provided on the conductor circuits  under the openings  of the solder resist layer , respectively.In the multilayer printed circuit board  in the second embodiment, the IC chip  is included in the core substrate  in advance and the transition layer  is provided on each die pad  of the IC chip . Due to this, it is possible to electrically connect the IC chip to the multilayer printed circuit board (or package substrate) without using lead members and a sealing resin.Furthermore, by providing the transition layers  made of copper on the respective die pads , it is possible to prevent resin residues on the die pads  and to prevent the die pads  from being discolored or dissolved even after impregnating the multilayer printed circuit board in an acid, an oxidizer or an etching solution in a later step or conducting various annealing steps.Moreover, in manufacturing steps to be described later, positioning marks  are formed on the core substrate  with reference to the positioning marks  of the IC chip  and the via holes  are formed to conform to the positioning marks , respectively. Due to this, it is possible to accurately position the via holes  on the pads  of the IC chip  and to ensure connecting the pads  to the via holes , respectively.Next, a method of manufacturing the multilayer printed circuit board described above with reference to  will be described with reference to .(1) First, an insulating resin substrate (or core substrate) , in which prepregs each having a core material made of glass cloths or the like and impregnated with a resin such as epoxy are built up, is used as a starting material (see ). Next, a recess  for containing an IC chip is formed on one side of the core substrate  by counter boring (see .\n\n(2) Then, an adhesive material  is applied to the recess  using a printing machine. At this time, potting instead of application may be conducted. Next, an IC chip  is mounted on the adhesive material  (see ).\n\n(3) The upper surface of the IC chip  is depressed or struck to thereby completely contain the IC chip  in the recess  (see . The plan view of the IC chip  and the core substrate  shown in  are shown in . The IC chip  contained in the recess  of the core substrate  is not accurately positioned relative to the core substrate because of the working accuracy of the recess and the interposition of the adhesive material .\n\n(4) The positioning marks  provided in the four corners of the IC chip  are photographed by a camera , and recesses are provided in the four corners of the core substrate  with reference to the positioning marks , respectively, by laser (). The plan view of the IC chip  and the core substrate  shown in  is shown in .\n\n(5) Thereafter, the entire surface of the core substrate  which contains the IC chip  therein is subjected to deposition or sputtering, to form a conductive metallic film  on the entire surface (). The metal used is formed out of one or more of tin, chromium, titanium, nickel, zinc, cobalt, gold, copper and the like. In some cases, two or more layers may be formed out of different metals. The thickness of the metallic layer is preferably in the range of 0.001 to 2.0 μm. More preferably, the thickness is 0.01 to 1.0 μm.A plated film  may be formed on the metallic film  by electroless plating, electroplating or a combination thereof (). The type of the metal used for plating is exemplified by copper, nickel, gold, silver, zinc or iron. Copper is preferably used because it has appropriate electrical characteristic and is economical and buildup conductor layers formed in a later step mainly consist of copper. The thickness of the plated film is preferably in the range of 0.01 to 5.0 μm. If the thickness is smaller than 0.01 μm, the plated film cannot be formed on the entire surface. If the thickness exceeds 5.0 μm, it becomes difficult to etch away the film. Besides, the positioning marks are embedded and cannot be recognized. The preferable range is 0.1 to 3.0 μm. The plated film can be also formed by sputtering or deposition.(6) Thereafter, a resist α is provided, a mask  on which patterns and positioning marks corresponding to the pads  are drawn is mounted (). This mask  is positioned while applying light from above and the image of reflection light from the positioning marks  is picked up by a camera  so that the positioning mark through holes on the core substrate  side can fall in the positioning marks which are drawn to be ring-shaped. In the second embodiment, since the copper plated film  is formed even on the positioning marks , the reflection light easily transmits the resist α and the substrate and the mask can be easily positioned relative to each other.\n\n(7) Plating resists  are formed so as to provide opening portions above the respective pads  of the IC chip by exposure and development and electroplated films  are provided by electroplating (). After removing the plating resists , the electroless plated film  and the metallic film  under the plating resists  are removed, thereby forming transition layers  on the pads  of the IC chip and forming positioning marks  on the recesses , respectively ().\n\n(8) Next, an etching solution is sprayed on the substrate and the surfaces of the transition layers  are etched, thereby forming rough surfaces α, respectively (see ). The rough surfaces can be formed by electroless plating or an oxidization-reduction process.\n\n(9) The same thermosetting resin sheet as that in the first embodiment is vacuum-compression laminated onto the substrate which has gone through the above-stated steps and an interlayer resin insulating layer  is provided (see ).\n\n(10) Next, the images of the positioning marks  are picked up by the camera  while transmitting the interlayer resin insulating layer , thereby conducting positioning. Via hole openings  each having a diameter of 80 μm are provided in the interlayer resin insulating layer  using COgas laser having a wavelength of 10.4 μm under the conditions of a beam diameter of 5 mm, a pulse width of 5.0 μseconds, a mask hole diameter of 0.5 mm and one shot (see ).\n\n(11) Next, the surface of the interlayer resin insulating layer  is roughened to thereby form a rough surface α (see ).\n\n(12) Then, a metallic layer  is formed on the surface of the interlayer resin insulating layer  (see ).\n\n(13) A commercially available photosensitive dry film α is bonded to the substrate  which has been completed with the above-stated steps, and a photomask film , on which patterns and positioning marks corresponding to the pads are drawn, is mounted. The plan view of the core substrate  before the photomask film  is mounted is shown in  and a state in which the photomask film  is mounted is shown in .This mask  is positioned while light is applied from above and the image of reflection light from the positioning marks  is picked up by the camera  so that the positioning marks  at the core substrate  side may fall in the positioning marks which are drawn to be ring-shaped. In the second embodiment, since the plated film  is formed on the positioning marks , the reflection light is easily transmitted by the interlayer resin insulating layer  and the film α and accurate positioning can be conducted. As stated above, the roughening process is conducted to the copper plated films  constituting the positioning marks . It is also possible not to conduct the roughening process so as to increase surface reflectance or to conduct the roughening process and then conducting a surface smoothening process using chemicals or laser.(14) Thereafter, exposure is performed with 100 J/cmand a development process is conducted with 0.8% of sodium carbonate, thereby forming plating resists  each having a thickness of 15 μm ().\n\n(15) Next, electroplating is conducted under the same conditions as those in the first embodiment to thereby form an electroplated film  having a thickness of 15 μm (see ).\n\n(16) After separating and removing the plating resists  with 5% NaOH, the metallic layer  under the plating resists  are dissolved and removed by etching and conductor circuits  each consisting of the metallic layer , the electroplated film  and via holes  are formed and rough surfaces α and α are formed with an etching solution (see ).\n\n(17) Next, the steps of (6) to (12) stated above are repeated, thereby forming an interlayer resin insulating layer  and conductor circuits  (include via holes ) further above (see ).\n\n(18) Next, the same solder resist composition as that in the first embodiment is applied to the substrate  to have a thickness of 20 μm, and a drying process is conducted. After that, exposure is conducted with a photomask hermetically contacted with the solder resist layer , a development process is conducted with a DMTG solution, and opening portions  each having a diameter of 200 μm are formed (see ).\n\n(19) Then, the substrate on which the solder resist layer (or organic resin insulating layer)  is formed is immersed in an electroless nickel plating solution, thereby forming nickel plated layers  on opening portions , respectively. Further, the substrate is immersed in the electroless plating solution and a gold plated layer  having a thickness of 0.03 μm is formed on each of the nickel plated layers , thereby forming solder pads  on the conductor circuits , respectively (see ).\n\n(20) Thereafter, a solder paste is printed on the opening portions  of the solder resist layer  and reflowed at 200° C., thereby forming BGA's . Thus, it is possible to obtain a multilayer printed circuit board  including the IC chip  and having the BGA's  (see ). PGA's (conductive connection pins) instead of the BGA's may be arranged.Next, description will be given to a multilayer printed circuit board according to the first modification of the second embodiment of the present invention with reference to .In the second embodiment stated above, the IC chip is contained in the multilayer printed circuit board. In the first modification of the second embodiment, by contrast, an IC chip  is contained in the multilayer printed circuit board and, at the same time, an IC chip  is mounted on the surface thereof. As for the IC chip  included in the circuit board, a cache memory having a relatively low calorific value is employed. As for the IC chip  on the surface, a CPU for arithmetic operation is mounted.In this first modification of the second embodiment, penetrating holes  constituting the through holes  of a core substrate  are formed with reference to the positioning marks  of the core substrate.Next, the constitution of a multilayer printed circuit board according to the third embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to  showing the cross section of a multilayer printed circuit board .As shown in , the multilayer printed circuit board  consists of a core substrate  containing therein an IC chip , an interlayer resin insulating layer  and an interlayer resin insulating layer . Via holes  and conductor circuits  are formed on the interlayer resin insulating layer . Via holes  and conductor circuits  are formed on the interlayer resin insulating layer .The IC chip  is covered with an IC protective film (made of passivation+polyimide)  and aluminum die pads  each constituting an input/output terminal are provided in the respective openings of the IC protective film . An oxide film  is formed on each die pad . A transition layer  is formed on each die pad  and the oxide film  on the surface, on which the die pad  and the transition layer  contact with each other, is removed.A solder resist layer  is formed on the interlayer resin insulating layer . A solder bump  or a conductive connection pin, which is not shown, for connecting to an external substrate such as a daughter board or a mother board, which is not shown, is provided on the conductor circuit  under each opening portion  of the solder resist layer .In the multilayer printed circuit board  in this embodiment, the IC chip  is included in the core substrate  in advance and the transition layers  are provided on the die pads  of the IC chip , respectively. Due to this, alignment can be easily made when forming via holes and buildup layers can be stably formed even with a die pad pitch of 150 μm or less and a pad size of 20 μm or less. If the via holes of the interlayer resin insulating layers are formed by photoetching with the die pads on which the transition layers are not formed and via hole diameter is larger than a die pad diameter, then the polyimide layer serving as the protective layer on the surface of each die pad is dissolved and damaged during a de-smear process conducted as a via hole bottom residue removal process and a interlayer resin insulating layer surface roughening process. On the other hand, in case of using laser, if the via hole diameter is larger than the die pad diameter, the die pads and passivation-polyimide layers (or IC protective films) are damaged by laser. Moreover, if the pads of the IC chip are very small and the via hole diameter is larger than the die pad size, then positioning becomes quite difficult even with a photoetching method or a laser method. As a result, connection errors between the die pads and the via holes frequently occur.By providing the transition layers  on the respective die pads , by contrast, it is possible to ensure the connection of the via holes  to the die pads  even with a die pad pitch of 150 μm or less and a pad size of 20 μm or less, and the connection characteristic between the pads  and the via holes  and reliability are improved. Further, by interposing the transition layers each having a larger diameter on the respective pads of the IC chip, there is no fear of dissolving and damaging the die pads and the IC protective films (passivation-polyimide layers) even if the substrate is immersed in an acid or an etching solution in later steps such as de-smear and plating steps or the substrate has gone through various annealing steps.Furthermore, since the oxide film  formed on the die pads  made of aluminum is removed on the surfaces on which the die pads  and the transition layers  contact with one another by an oxide film removal process to be described later, it is possible to reduce the electrical resistances of the die pads  and to increase the electrical conductivity thereof.Next, a method of manufacturing the multilayer printed circuit board described above with reference to  will be described with reference to .(1) First, an insulating resin substrate (or core substrate)  in which prepregs each having a core material made of glass cloths or the like and impregnated with a resin such as epoxy are built up, is used as a starting material (see ). Next, a recess  for containing an IC chip is formed on one side of the core substrate  by counter boring (see ).\n\n(2) Then, an adhesive material  is applied to the recess  using a printing machine. At this time, potting instead of application may be conducted. Next, an IC chip  is mounted on the adhesive material . The IC chip  is covered with an IC protective film (made of passivation t polyimide) , and die pads  each constituting an input/output terminal are provided in the respective openings of the IC protective film . Also, the surfaces of the die pads  are covered with oxide films , respectively (see ). Here, an explanatory view enlarging the die pad  portion of the IC chip  is shown in .\n\n(3) Then, the upper surface of the IC chip  is depressed or struck to thereby completely contain the IC chip  in the recess  (see ). It is thereby possible to flatten the core substrate .\n\n(4) Next, the core substrate  containing therein the IC chip  is put in a sputtering device in a vacuum state. While argon gas which is inactive gas is used as sputtering gas, inverse sputtering is performed with the exposed oxide films  on the surfaces of the die pads  as targets, thereby removing the exposed oxide films  (see ). Here, an explanatory view enlarging the die pad  portion of the IC chip  is shown in . It is thereby possible to reduce the electric resistances of the die pads , to improve the electric conductivities thereof and to improve the adhesiveness thereof with corresponding transition layers. In this case, inverse sputtering is employed as an oxide film removal process. A plasma process instead of the inverse sputtering can be employed. In case of the plasma process, the substrate is put in a device in a vacuum state, plasmas are discharged in oxygen or nitrogen, carbon dioxide and carbon tetrafluoride to thereby remove the oxide films on the surfaces of the die pads. It is also possible to process the die pad surfaces with an acid other than the plasma process and to remove the oxide films. It is preferable to use a phosphoric acid in the oxide film removal process. The oxide films are removed herein. Even if films such as anticorrosive nitride films are formed on the die pads, it is preferable to conduct a removal process so as to improve the electric conductivities of the die pads.\n\n(5) Thereafter, using the same device consecutively, the entire surface of the core substrate  is sputtered with Cr and Cu as targets without exposing the IC chip to an oxygen atmosphere, thereby forming a conductive metallic film  on the entire surface (see ). The metallic film  is preferably formed out of one or more layers of metals such as tin, chromium, titanium, nickel, zinc, cobalt, gold and silver. The thickness of the metallic film is preferably formed to be in the range of 0.001 to 2.0 μm. The thickness is more preferably 0.01 to 1.0 μm. The thickness of a chromium layer is set so as not to generate cracks on the sputtered layer and to sufficiently hermetically contact with a copper sputtered layer. In the third embodiment, the removal of films and the formation of the lowermost layer (metallic layer)  of each transition layer are conducted in the same device under a non-oxygen atmosphere in succession. Due to this, it is possible to improve the electric conductivity between the die pads  of the IC chip and the transition layer  without forming oxide films on the pad surfaces again.A plated film  may be formed on the metallic film  by electroless plating, electroplating or a combination thereof (see ). The type of the metal used for plating is exemplified by copper, nickel, gold, silver, zinc or iron. Copper is preferably used because it has appropriate electrical characteristic and is economical and buildup conductor layers formed in a later step mainly consist of copper. The thickness of the plated film is preferably in the range of 0.01 to 5.0 μm. The thickness is more preferably 0.1 to 3 μm. The plated film can be also formed by sputtering or deposition. The desirable combination of the first thin film layer and the second thin film layer is chromium-copper, chromium-nickel, titanium-copper, titanium-nickel or the like. These combinations are superior to the other combinations in junction with metal and electric conductivity.(6) Thereafter, a resist is applied or a photosensitive film is laminated, and plating resists  are provided to provide openings on the upper portions of the pads of the IC chip  by exposure and development, thereby forming electroplated films  (see ). The thickness of the electroplated film  is preferably about 1 to 20 μm. After removing the plating resists , the electroless plated film  and the metallic film  under the plating resists  are etched away, thereby forming transition layers  on the pads  of the IC chip, respectively (see ). Also, an explanatory view enlarging the die pad  portion of the IC chip  is shown in .In this case, the transition layers  are formed by the plating resists. It is also possible to form the transition layers  on the die pads  of the IC chip  by uniformly forming electroplated films  on the respective electroless plated film , forming an etching resist, conducting exposure and development to expose the portions of the metal other than those on the transition layers and conducting etching. In this case, the thickness of the electroless plated film  is preferably in the range of 1 to 20 μm. If the thickness exceeds that range, undercut occurs during the etching and gaps are generated in the interfaces between the transition layers and via holes to be formed.(7) Next, an etching solution is sprayed on the substrate, the surfaces of the transition layers  are etched to thereby form rough surfaces α on the respective surfaces (see ). It is also possible to form the rough surfaces by electroless plating or an oxidization-reduction process.\n\n(8) A thermosetting resin sheet is vacuum-compression laminated onto the substrate which has gone through the above-stated steps as in the case of the first embodiment, thereby providing an interlayer resin insulating layer  (see ).\n\n(9) Next, via hole openings  are provided in the interlayer resin insulating layer  using COgas laser (see ). Thereafter, resin residues on the openings  may be removed using an oxidizer such as a chromic acid or a permanganic acid. By providing the transition layers  made of copper on the die pads , respectively, alignment can be easily made at the time of forming via holes, the connection of the via holes onto the die pads  is ensured and the connection characteristics between the pads and the via holes and reliability are improved. Thus, it is possible to stably form buildup layers. By providing the transition layers each having a larger diameter on the respective pads of the IC chip, there is no fear of dissolving and damaging the die pads  and the IC protective films (passivation-polyimide layers)  even if the substrate is immersed in an acid or an etching solution in later steps such as a via hole bottom residue removal process, a de-smear process conducted as an interlayer resin insulating layer surface roughening process, a plating step and the like or if the substrate has gone through various annealing steps. In this case, the resin residues are removed by using a permanganic acid. It is also possible to conduct a de-smear process using oxygen plasma.\n\n(10) Next, the surface of the interlayer resin insulating layer  is roughened to thereby form a rough surface α (see ). This roughening step can be omitted.\n\n(11) Next, after a palladium catalyst is supplied to the surface of the interlayer resin insulating layer , the substrate is immersed in an electroless plating solution and an electroless plated film  is formed on the surface of the interlayer resin insulating layer  (see ).\n\n(12) A commercially available photosensitive dry film is bonded to the substrate  which has been subjected to the above processes, a chromium glass mask is mounted, exposure is performed with 40 mj/cmand then a development process is conducted with 0.8% sodium carbonate, thereby providing plating resists  each having a thickness of 25 μm. Next, electroplating is conducted under the same conditions as those in the first embodiment, thereby forming electroplated films  each having a thickness of 18 μm (see ).\n\n(13) After separating and removing the plating resists  with 5% NaOH, the electroless plated film  under the plating resists is dissolved and removed by etching, conductor circuits  each consisting of the electroless plated film  and the electroplated film  and having a thickness of 16 μm and via holes  are formed, and rough surfaces α and α are formed by an etching solution (see ). The following steps are the same as the steps (13) to (17) in the first embodiment stated above, which description will not be given herein.Now, a multilayer printed circuit board according to the first modification of the third embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to .  shows the cross-section of a multilayer printed circuit board  and  are views showing an enlarged die pad  portion, where  is a view showing a state before an oxide film removal process is conducted,  is a view showing a state of the oxide film removal process and  is a view showing a state after a transition layer  is formed on each die pad .In the third embodiment stated above, description has been given to a case where BGA's are provided. In the first modification of the third embodiment, which is almost the same as the third embodiment, the multilayer printed circuit board is constituted in a PGA mode for establishing connection through conductive connection pins  as shown in .In the manufacturing method of the first modification of the third embodiment, a part of the oxide film  of the die pad  is removed by conducting one of oxide film removal process from among an inverse sputtering process, a plasma process and an acid process as shown in . Then, as shown in , a transition layer  consisting of a metallic film , an electroless plated film  and an electroplated film  are formed on the die pad . It is thereby possible to reduce the electric resistance of the die pad  and to improve electrical conductivity thereof as in the case of the third embodiment.A multilayer printed circuit board was obtained by forming transition layers as in the case of the third embodiment except that film removal was not conducted.Test ResultThe result of evaluating the multilayer printed circuit boards in the third embodiment and in the comparison example with respect to a total of four items of 1) sectional state, 2) resistance measurement value, 3) sectional state after reliability test, and 4) resistance measurement value, is shown in a table of .After forming the transition layer, the layer was cut in cross section and whether or not an oxide film is present on the pad was observed with a microscope (×100).After forming the transition layer, connection resistance was measured. A numeric value measured is an average of those measured in 20 places.3) Sectional State after Reliability TestAfter forming the multilayer printed circuit board and then finishing a heat cycle test (1000 cycles with one cycle of (130° C./3 minutes)+(−60° C./3 minutes)), the multilayer printed circuit board was cut in cross section and whether or not an oxide film was present on the pad and whether or not the transition was separated was observed with the microscope (×100).4) Resistance Measurement Value after Reliability TestAfter forming the multilayer printed circuit board and then finishing the heat cycle test (1000 cycles with one cycle of (130° C./3 minutes)+(−60° C./3 minutes)), connection resistance was measured. A numeric value measured is an average of those measured in 20 places.As shown in the table of , the multilayer printed circuit board in the third embodiment had no oxide film and had a low connection resistance value, so that no problem occurred to electrical connection. Besides, the multilayer printed circuit board in the third embodiment was less deteriorated after the reliability test. It is noted that even after repeating 2000 cycles of the heat cycle test, not so a great increase in resistance value was observed.In the comparison example, the oxide film remained and the connection resistance value was high. In some cases, portions on which no electrical connection could be established were observed. This trend was more conspicuous after the reliability test."

                "The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing an electric wire with a terminal.Electrical wires having an aluminum or aluminum-alloy (hereinafter referred to as an aluminum or the like) core wires have been used for power applications such as electrical lines from power plants. In recent years, applications of electronic wires having the same kind of core wires to wires in vehicles to reduce weights of the vehicles are expected.The wires used for such a purpose have bare parts of core wires located at ends of the wires and from which sheath are stripped off. Wire barrel of terminals are crimped onto ends of the respective core wires, and the terminals are connected to terminals of counter parts.A metal used for each core wire has characteristics that a metal oxide layer having insulating properties is easily formed on a surface of the core wire. Therefore, a high contact resistance may be present between the core wire and the terminal. Aluminum oxide layers that are very hard are easily formed on surfaces of core wires made of aluminum or the like. As a result, a high contact resistance appears between each core wire and a terminal, which is a problem. One method to reduce the contact resistance between the core wire and the terminal is that a wire barrel having serration grooves is crimped onto the core wire.When the terminal having the serration grooves is crimped on to the core wire, edges of the serration grooves rub against the metal oxide layer on the surface of the core wire. As a result, the metal oxide layer is cracked and a new metal surface of the core wire emerges. The wire barrel of the terminal is in contact with the new metal surface. Therefore, the contact resistance between the core wire and the terminal can be reduced.Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 10-125362.If a low pressure is applied to the core wire during the crimping of the terminal, the metal oxide layer on the surface of the core wire is not sufficiently cracked. As a result, the terminal is not in good contact with the metal under the metal oxide layer. Namely, the contact resistance cannot be sufficiently reduced by the above method.If a high pressure is applied to the core wire during the crimping of the terminal, a large stress concentrates on the core wire on which the terminal is crimped and the core wire is more likely to be broken. This may reduce reliability of mechanical connection between the terminal and the electric wire.The above problem is also applicable for wires having core wires made of metal other than aluminum or the like (e.g., copper or copper alloy).The present invention was made in view of the foregoing circumstances. An object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing an electric wire with an insulator and a terminal that is crimped onto a core wire with an appropriate force so that the core wire is not broken and a contact resistance between the electric wire and the terminal is low.The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing an electric wire with a terminal, a barrel portion of which is crimped onto a core wire constructed of metal wires. The method includes at least creating a crack in a metal oxide layer formed on a metal surface of the core wire by applying a mechanical force to the metal oxide layer immediately before crimping the barrel portion of the terminal onto the core wire.By creating the crack in the metal oxide layer on the surface of the core wire immediately before the crimping of the barrel portion of the terminal onto the core wire, a new metal surface emerges from the metal oxide layer through the crack.Even when the new metal surface does not emerge, the crack, which is created in the metal oxide layer in advance, expands during the crimping of the barrel portion of the terminal onto the core wire. As a result, the new metal surface emerges and the barrel portion of the terminal is properly in contact with the core wire.According to the present invention, the crack is created in the metal oxide layer formed on the core wire in advance. Therefore, the contact resistance between the terminal and the core wire can be maintained at a low level even when the pressure applied to the terminal during the crimping is reduced.The first embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to . An electric wire  with a terminal of this embodiment includes an electrical wire  and a terminal . The electrical wire  includes a core wire  covered by a resin insulator. The core wire  is bared at an end of the electrical wire . The terminal  is crimped onto the bare part of the core wire .As illustrated in , the electric wire  includes the core wire  and an insulator . The core wire  is constructed of a plurality of twisted metal wires . The insulator  is made of synthetic resin having insulating properties. The insulator  surrounds a bunch of the twisted metal wires . Each metal wire  is made of copper, copper alloy, aluminum, aluminum alloy or any other kind of metal suitable for an application. In this embodiment, an aluminum alloy is used. At the end of the electric wire, the insulator  is stripped off and the core wire  is bared.As illustrated in , the terminal  is prepared by pressing a metal plate into a predetermined shape with a die. The terminal  includes an insulator barrel , a wire barrel , and a connecting tip . The insulator barrel  is crimped onto the insulator  of the electric wire  so as to surround the insulator . The wire barrel  continues from the insulator barrel  and crimped onto the core wire  so as to surround the core wire . The connecting tip  continues from the wire barrel . The connecting tip  is to be connected to a terminal of counter part. Each of the insulator barrel  and the wire barrel  has a pair of plates that project upward. A body  in which the wire barrel  is formed has a plurality of serration grooves  that extend in a direction perpendicular to the core wire . The serration grooves  are formed by pressing.The electric wire  with the terminal in this embodiment is manufactured as follows.First, a preprocess illustrated in  is performed. In the preprocess, the core wire  is pressed by a pressing machine . The pressing machine  includes an upper die  and a lower die . Opposed surfaces of the dies  and  have a plurality of rectangular grooves  formed at predetermined intervals and parallel to each other. As illustrated in , a width of each rectangular groove  is a half of each of the above intervals. Furthermore, the rectangular grooves  of the upper die  are displaced from the rectangular grooves  of the lower die  by the width thereof. Namely, recessed portions  and protruding portions  of the upper die  and the lower die  are aligned with each other. The core wire  of the electric wire  is set in the pressing machine  perpendicular to the rectangular grooves . The core wire  is sandwiched between the upper die  and the lower die , and pressed.Through the preprocess, the core wire  is plastically deformed into a rectangular wave-like shape as illustrated in . Surfaces of the core wire  at bent parts thereof in rectangular shapes are stretched along the longitudinal direction of the core wire . Therefore, even when metal oxide layers (aluminum oxide layers for the aluminum alloy) are formed on the surfaces of the core wire , many cracks are created in the metal oxide layers, which are relatively hard and formed on the surfaces, in the bent parts. New metal surfaces may emerge from the metal oxide layers.Next, the terminal  is crimped onto the core wire  by a known crimping machine  as illustrated in . The terminal  is placed on an anvil  of the crimping machine , and then the bare part of the core wire  of the electric wire  is set at a predetermined position on the terminal . A crimper  is lowered to the core wire  and the terminal  set as above. The insulator  is swaged by the insulator barrel , and the core wire  is swaged by the wire barrel .When the core wire  is swaged by the wire barrel , the core wire  is pressed and stretched by the wire barrel . As a result, the core wire  is plastically deformed. During the plastic-deformation of the core wire , the cracks in the metal oxide layers on the surfaces of the core wire  easily expand even the amount of the plastic-deformation is small. This is because the cracks are created in advance in the preprocess. New metal surfaces emerge from the metal oxide layers. The terminal  is in contact with the new metal surfaces. As a result, proper electrical connection is established between the core wire  and the terminal .Especially, the edges of the serration grooves  of the terminal  in this embodiment sharply bite into the new metal surfaces of the core wire . Therefore, large contact areas are provided between the new metal surfaces of the core wire  and the terminal . This contributes to reducing the resistance.According to the first embodiment, the preprocess is performed immediately before the crimping of the wire barrel of the terminal  onto the core wire . In the preprocess, the core wire  is pressed. As a result, the metal oxide layers on the surfaces of the core wire  are cracked in the preprocess.Even when the pressure applied in the crimping process of the terminal  is reduced, sufficient areas of the new metal surfaces of the core wire  under the metal oxide layers are properly in contact with the terminal . Therefore, the contact resistance between the core wire  and the wire barrel  can be reduced in comparison to the wire barrel  crimped onto the core wire  only by a known crimping process.To achieve the same resistance as the resistance between the core wire  and the wire barrel  crimped onto the core wire  by the known crimped process, a lower crimping pressure is required. Therefore, the metal wires  of the core wire  are less likely to be broken by the edges of the wire barrel  due to a high crimping pressure in the crimping process. Strength of mechanical connection (or a tension strength) between the electric wire  and the terminal  can be increased.The second embodiment will be explained with reference to . A preprocess of this embodiment is different from that of the first embodiment but other configurations are the same as the first embodiment. The same parts as those of the first embodiment will be indicated by the same symbols and will not be explained.As illustrated in , a pressing machine  of this embodiment includes an upper die  and a lower die . Opposed surfaces of the dies  and  have a plurality of triangular grooves  formed at predetermined intervals so as to extend parallel to each other.A width of each triangular groove  is a half of each of the above intervals. Furthermore, the triangular grooves  of the upper die  are displaced from the triangular grooves  of the lower die  by the width thereof. Namely, recessed portions  and protruding portions  of the upper die  and the lower die  are aligned with each other. The core wire  of the electric wire  is set in the pressing machine  perpendicular to the triangular grooves . The core wire  is pressed in the triangular grooves .The preprocess is performed on the core wire  of the electric wire  by the pressing machine  as illustrated in . Through the preprocess, the core wire  is pressed and plastically deformed into a wave-like form along the triangular grooves . Surfaces of the core wire  at parts thereof bent so as to form the wave-like shape are stretched along the longitudinal direction of the core wire . Therefore, even when metal oxide layers are formed on the surfaces of the core wire , many cracks are created in the metal oxide layers. New metal surfaces may emerge from the metal oxide layers.Similar to the first embodiment, even when the pressure applied in the crimping process of the terminal  is reduced, sufficient areas of the new metal surfaces of the core wire  emerging from the metal oxide layers are properly in contact with the terminal . Therefore, the contact resistance between the core wire  and the wire barrel  can be reduced.The third embodiment will be explained with reference to . A preprocess of this embodiment is different from that of the first embodiment but other configurations are the same as the first embodiment. The same parts as those of the first embodiment will be indicated by the same symbols and will not be explained.As illustrated in , a pressing machine  of this embodiment includes an upper die  and a lower die . Each of opposed surfaces of the dies  and  has a shallow rectangular groove  formed so as to extend along the axis of the electric wire . The core wire  of the electric wire  is pressed in the shallow rectangular grooves . An escape recess  is formed continuously from each shallow rectangular groove  for holding a part of the electric wire  covered by the insulator .Through the preprocess performed on the core wire  of the electric wire  by the pressing machine , the core wire  is pressed and plastically deformed into a flattened quadrangular column-like shape along the shallow rectangular grooves  as illustrated in . The adjacent metal wires  rub against each other while they are firmly pressed and deformed. As a result, even when the metal oxide layers are formed on the surface of the metal wires , many cracks are created in the metal oxide layers and new metal surfaces may emerge from the metal oxide layers.Similar to the first embodiment, even when the pressure applied in the crimping process of the terminal  is reduced, sufficient areas of the new metal surfaces of the core wire  emerging from the metal oxide layers are properly in contact with the terminal . Therefore, the contact resistance between the core wire  and the wire barrel  can be reduced.The fourth embodiment will be explained with reference to . A preprocess of this embodiment is different from that of the first embodiment but other configurations are the same as the first embodiment. The same parts as those of the first embodiment will be indicated by the same symbols and will not be explained.As illustrated in , the core wire  is roll-pressed by a roll-pressing machine  in the preprocess of this embodiment. The roll-pressing machine  includes a pair of rollers  and . Each of the upper roller  and the lower roller  has a columnar shape. Roller shafts  project from the respective ends of the rollers  and . The center of each roller  or  is aligned with the center of the corresponding roller  or  and the diameter thereof is smaller than that of the roller  or .As illustrated in , an outer surface of each roller  or  has rectangular grooves  that extend parallel to the roller shaft . The rectangular grooves  are formed at predetermined intervals in entire surfaces of the rollers  and . When the upper roller  and the lower roller  are brought closest to each other, recessed portions  and the protruding portions  of the upper roller  are aligned with respective protruding portions  and recessed portions  of the lower roller .As illustrated in , the core wire  of the electric wire  is sandwiched between the rollers  and  of the roll-pressing machine  and roll-pressed. After the core wire  is passed between the rollers  and , the rotations of the rollers  and  are reversed. As a result, the core wire  between the rollers  and  is removed from the rollers  and .Through the preprocess performed on the core wire  of the electric wire  by the roll-pressing machine , the core wire  is plastically deformed into a rectangular wave-like shape. Surfaces of the core wire  at bent parts thereof in rectangular shapes are stretched along the longitudinal direction of the core wire . Therefore, even when metal oxide layers (aluminum oxide layers for the aluminum alloy) are formed on the surfaces of the core wire , many cracks are created in the metal oxide layers in the bent parts. New metal surfaces may emerge from the metal oxide layers.Similar to the first embodiment, even when the pressure applied in the crimping process of the terminal  is reduced, sufficient areas of the new metal surfaces of the core wire  emerging from the metal oxide layers are properly in contact with the terminal . Therefore, the contact resistance between the core wire  and the wire barrel  can be reduced.The fifth embodiment will be explained with reference to . A preprocess of this embodiment is different from that of the first embodiment but other configurations are the same as the first embodiment. The same parts as those of the first embodiment will be indicated by the same symbols and will not be explained.As illustrated in , the core wire  is roll-pressed by a roll-pressing machine  in the preprocess of this embodiment. The roll-pressing machine  includes a pair of rollers  and . A surface of each roller  or  has a shallow groove  that extends perpendicular to a roller shaft  of the roller  or . When the rollers  and  are placed against each other, a rectangular hole is formed by the bottoms and the sidewalls of the rollers  and .As illustrated in , the core wire  of the electric wire  is inserted in the rectangular hole formed between the rollers  and  of the roll-pressing machine , and roll pressed by the rollers  and . After the core wire  is passed between the rollers  and , the rotations of the rollers  and  are reversed. As a result, the core wire  between the rollers  and  is removed from the rollers  and  as illustrated in .Through the preprocess performed on the core wire  of the electric wire  by the roll-pressing machine , the core wire  is plastically deformed into a quadrangular column-like shape corresponding to the rectangular hole. The adjacent metal wires  rub against each other while they are firmly pressed and deformed. As a result, even when the metal oxide layers are formed on the surface of the metal wires , many cracks are created in the metal oxide layers and new metal surfaces emerge from the metal oxide layers.Similar to the first embodiment, even when the pressure applied in the crimping process of the terminal  is reduced, sufficient areas of the new metal surfaces of the core wire  emerging from the metal oxide layers are properly in contact with the terminal . Therefore, the contact resistance between the core wire  and the wire barrel  can be reduced.The present invention is not limited to the above embodiments explained in the above description with reference to the drawings. The following embodiments may be included in the technical scope of the present invention, for example.(1) In the above embodiments, the core wire constructed of a plurality of wires is used. However, a core wire constructed of a single wire can be used.(2) In the above embodiments, the pressing process or the roll-pressing process are performed for creating the cracks in the metal oxide layers by applying mechanical forces. However, a brushing process in which a surface of the core wire is brushed by a metal brush may be performed instead of the above process.(3) In the third embodiment, the core wire  is plastically deformed into the flattened quadrangular column-like shape (having a rectangular cross section) in the preprocess performed by the pressing machine . However, the core wire  may be plastically deformed into a different type of quadrangular column-like shape, that is, other than a rectangular column-like shape, from the flattened quadrangular column-like shape (or the rectangular column-like shape). Furthermore, the core wire  may be plastically deformed into a polygonal column-like shape other than the quadrangular column-like shape. For example, a preprocess may be performed by a pressing machine having an upper die A and a lower die B illustrated in . Through the preprocess, a part of a round core wire  is plastically deformed into a hexagonal column-like shape and prepared as a plastically-deformed portion .Furthermore, the core wire  may be formed in a shape other than a polygonal column-like shape. For example, a part of the core wire  may be plastically deformed into an elliptic column-like shape and prepared as a plastically-deformed portion  illustrated in  in a preprocess performed using dies. Still furthermore, a part of the core wire  may be plastically deformed such that a diameter (or a radius) thereof is reduced in this preprocess and prepared as a plastically-deformed portion . The plastically-deformed portion  (or a reduced diameter portion) may be prepared by a pressing machine or a roll-pressing machine. As illustrated in , an upper roller  and a lower roller  of a roll-pressing machine  have half round (round-arched) grooves  and  respectively in the outer surfaces. As illustrated in , a part of the core wire  is pressed in a round hole formed by the grooves  and  of the rollers  and , and prepared as a plastically-deformed portion  (or a reduced diameter portion).(4) In the preprocess, ultrasonic vibrations may be applied to the wires of the core wire  to create rough areas (with microscopic asperities) on the surfaces of the metal wires . The rough areas may be created by applying ultrasonic vibrations to the metal wires  through the dies used in the preprocess for plastically deforming the core wire .When forces are applied to the wires  by the wire barrel during the crimping of the wire barrel onto the core wire  including the wires  having the rough areas, the wires  rub against each other. When the rough areas on the surfaces of the wires  rub against each other, the oxide layers on the surfaces of the wires  are removed. As a result, new surfaces of the wires  emerge. When the emerged new surfaces are in contact with each other, the wires  are electrically connected to each other. The wires  located inner in a radial direction of the core wire  can be used for electrical connection between the electric wire  and the terminal . Therefore, the contact resistance between the electric wire  and the terminal  can be reduced.According to this configuration, the rough areas are created by applying ultrasonic vibrations (during the plastic deformation) in addition to the plastic deformation of the core wire  (to create cracks in the metal oxide layers by applying mechanical forces). As a result, the contact resistance between the core wire  and the wire barrel  can be further reduced.The core wire  may be roller-pressed instead of pressing with dies as in the process for preparing the plastically-deformed portion  (or the reduced diameter portion). In such a case, the plastically-deformed portion  (or the reduced diameter portion) may be placed between an upper die  having a groove  (or a recessed portion) and a lower die  having a groove  (or a recessed portion) as illustrated in  after the plastically-deformed portion  (or the reduced diameter portion) is formed by roll-pressing. Each groove  or  has the same diameter as that of the plastically-deformed portion  (or the reduced diameter portion). The dies  and  are provided as dies that do not plastically deform the core wire. Ultrasonic vibrations can be applied to the core wire  through the dies  and ."

                "The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a paste-type electrode of lead-acid battery and an apparatus for use in the manufacture of the paste-type electrode of lead-acid battery.A conventional paste-type electrode of lead-acid battery is manufactured as follows.First, an active material containing lead powder as its main component and other required components is kneaded with dilute sulfuric acid or water to prepare a paste-like active material. Then, a current collector made of a lead alloy and having a grid shape is filled with the prepared paste-like active material to obtain a filled electrode. An electrode surface of the filled electrode is pressed to enhance the filling performance of the paste-like active material. After the pressing, the filled electrode is dried. The current collector has relatively thick frame ribs and relatively thin inner ribs unitarily disposed inside the frame ribs to form a grid shape.Various processes of filling the current collector with the paste-like active material and pressing the electrode surface have been proposed in the related art.For example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 07-245100 (Patent Document 1) discloses a technique in which a current collector placed on a belt conveyor is sequentially transferred and filled with a paste-like active material when the current collector passes below a hopper containing the paste-like active material to fabricate a filled electrode. Then, the filled electrode is caused to pass through a forming roller apparatus, which presses an electrode surface of the filled electrode with a uniform pressure to manufacture an electrode with little fluctuation in thickness. In order to press the electrode surface with a uniform pressure, it is necessary to apply an equal pressure (press load) to both the left and right ends of a forming roller (in the axial direction of the forming roller). Thus, in the technique disclosed in Patent Document 1 discussed above, in order to equalize the pressures respectively applied to both the left and right ends of the forming roller, the forming roller is pressed by one or two cylinders that are actuated by a common pressure.Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 09-320574 (Patent Document 2) discloses disposing a back-spread improving roller between a belt conveyor and a forming roller to cause a paste-like active material to be sufficiently spread to the lower surface side (opposite to the side of the filled surface to which the paste-like active material is fed) of a current collector. The back-spread improving roller has a hard net on its peripheral surface. The upper surface of the net is covered with a thin fabric or a thin film. When an electrode passes through the back-spread improving roller, the net supports the current collector so that a gap is formed between the current collector and the back-spread improving roller. As a result, the paste-like active material fed to the current collector is pressed into the gap, which deforms the thin film covering the net and, at the same time, fills a space created by the deformation of the thin film with the paste-like active material. Then, the paste-like active material is pressed into a space between the lower surface of inner ribs of the current collector and the back-spread improving roller, which fills a space on the lower surface of the current collector with the paste-like active material. As a result, an electrode in which the inner ribs of the current collector are not exposed to the lower surface side of the current collector is manufactured.The technique according to Patent Document 1 is effective in uniformly pressing the electrode to suppress fluctuations in thickness of the electrode. However, the technique according to Patent Document 1 may not necessarily ensure that a space on the lower surface side (opposite to the side of the filled surface to which the paste-like active material is fed) of the electrode is reliably filled with the paste-like active material. In the technique according to Patent Document 2, since the current collector is supported by the hard net, the inner ribs of the current collector may be deformed. In addition, because the hard net may not necessarily be disposed at a location at which it supports the inner ribs of the current collector, the hard net may hinder the paste-like active material from filling a space on the lower surface side of the electrode. Moreover, at the location at which the hard net supports the inner ribs of the current collector, the inner ribs of the current collector may be exposed when the hard net is removed.An object of the present invention is to manufacture a paste-type electrode of lead-acid battery in which a space on the lower surface side of an electrode is favorably filled with a paste-like active material so that an inner rib does not remain exposed.Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for use in the manufacture of the paste-type electrode of lead-acid battery.In order to resolve the foregoing issues, the present invention provides a manufacturing method including the step of filling a current collector with a paste-like active material to obtain a filled electrode when the current collector passes below a filler including a hopper for containing the paste-like active material. The manufacturing method of the present invention also includes the step of thereafter pressing an electrode surface of the filled electrode during transfer of the filled electrode before the fed paste-like active material is hardened. The electrode surface as used herein includes both the filled surface which faces the hopper and to which the paste-like active material is fed from the hopper and the lower surface of the electrode which is opposite to the filled surface in the thickness direction. After the pressing, the filled electrode is dried as a matter of course. In the method according to the present invention, in particular, the pressing step includes: a first pressing step of intensively (mainly) pressing a first area of the electrode surface located on one side in a width direction that is perpendicular to a transfer direction in which the filled electrode is transferred and a perpendicular direction that is perpendicular to the electrode surface; a second pressing step of intensively (mainly) pressing a second area of the electrode surface located on the other side in the width direction; and a third pressing step of pressing the first and second areas of the electrode surface over the entire width of the filled electrode. The first to third pressing steps are each performed at least once. The pressing step is terminated by the third pressing step.In the first and second pressing steps described above, the paste-like active material, which has not been hardened yet, flows from the area which is intensively pressed toward the area which is not intensively pressed in the first and second areas arranged in the width direction of the filled electrode. Then, in the third pressing step, the paste-like active material flows such that the amount of the paste-like active material on the filled electrode becomes substantially equal over the entire width of the filled electrode. By performing the first to third pressing steps at least once each with the third pressing step performed at the end, the paste-like active material flows such that the inner rib of the current collector is not exposed but covered with the paste-like active material on the lower surface side (opposite to the side of the filled surface to which the paste-like active material is fed) of the electrode. In particular, in the case where at least an end surface of the inner rib in a thickness direction that does not face the filler is located more inward than an imaginary plane including an end surface of the frame rib in the thickness direction that does not face the filler, the effect is further positive.In the manufacturing method according to the present invention described above, the press load on the first area may be higher than the press load on the second area in the first pressing step, and the press load on the second area may be higher than the press load on the first area in the second pressing step. In addition, the press loads on the first and second areas may be equal to each other in the third pressing step. The press loads may be set as desired in accordance with the viscosity of the paste-like active material. The difference between the press load applied in pressing the first area and the press load applied in pressing the second area may be determined as desired as long as part of the paste-like active material flows toward the second area when the first area is pressed and part of the paste-like active material flows toward the first area when the second area is pressed.The first to third pressing steps may be respectively performed by first to third forming roller apparatuses each including a pair of rollers disposed to interpose the filled electrode in the perpendicular direction, which is perpendicular to the transfer direction in which the filled electrode is transferred, and to transfer the filled electrode in the transfer direction. In this case, the first forming roller apparatus is preferably configured such that the gap between the pair of rollers becomes gradually wider from the first area toward the second area of the electrode surface. In addition, the second forming roller apparatus is preferably configured such that the gap between the pair of rollers becomes gradually narrower from the first area toward the second area of the electrode surface. Further, the third forming roller apparatus is preferably configured such that the gap between the pair of rollers is constant. The use of the thus configured forming roller apparatuses makes it possible to gradually vary the press loads and thus to cause the paste-like active material to smoothly flow.The following effects are obtained by controlling the loads such that a maximum press load (a high load which includes the maximum press load that may be applied by the forming roller apparatus used) is applied to the area which is intensively pressed and a zero press load (a low load which includes the minimum press load that may be applied by the forming roller apparatus used) is applied to the area which is not intensively pressed. That is, it is possible to enhance the fluidability of the paste-like active material to the maximum, which further facilitates covering the inner rib of the current collector with the paste-like active material on the lower surface side of the electrode.The present invention also provides an apparatus for manufacturing a paste-type electrode of lead-acid battery, including: a belt conveyor that sequentially transfers a current collector placed thereon; a filler including a hopper for containing a paste-like active material to fill the current collector that passes below the filler with the paste-like active material to provide a filled electrode; and a pressing apparatus disposed behind the belt conveyor in a transfer direction in which the belt conveyor transfers the filled electrode to press an electrode surface of the filled electrode. The pressing apparatus includes: at least one first forming roller apparatus that intensively presses a first area of the electrode surface located on one side in a width direction that is perpendicular to the transfer direction and a perpendicular direction that is perpendicular to the electrode surface; at least one second forming roller apparatus that intensively presses a second area of the electrode surface located on the other side in the width direction; and at least one third forming roller apparatus that presses the first and second areas of the electrode surface over the entire width of the filled electrode. The third forming roller apparatus is disposed at the end of a row of the first to third forming roller apparatuses arranged in the transfer direction.The first to third forming roller apparatuses may each include a pair of rollers disposed to interpose the filled electrode in the perpendicular direction and to transfer the filled electrode in the transfer direction. In this case, the first forming roller apparatus may be configured such that the gap between the pair of rollers becomes gradually wider from the first area toward the second area of the electrode surface. The second forming roller apparatus may be configured such that the gap between the pair of rollers becomes gradually narrower from the first area toward the second area of the electrode surface. The third forming roller apparatus may be configured such that the gap between the pair of rollers is constant.Preferably, an outer peripheral portion of at least one roller in the pair of rollers forming each of the first to third forming roller apparatuses is formed by an elastic material, the at least one roller contacting an electrode surface of the filled electrode that faces the filler (that is, the filled surface). With such a configuration, the outer peripheral portion of the at least one roller on the side of the intensively pressed area is more or less deformed by a pressure applied when the roller contacts the filled surface of the electrode. When contacted by the outer peripheral portion of the at least one roller, the paste-like active material is squeezed or forced from the filled surface toward the opposite surface. In the first and second forming roller apparatuses, the paste-like active material, which has not been hardened yet, flows from the area which is intensively pressed toward the area which is not intensively pressed in the first and second areas arranged in the width direction of the filled electrode. Then, in the third forming roller apparatus, the paste-like active material flows such that the amount of the paste-like active material on the filled electrode becomes substantially equal over the entire width of the filled electrode. Consequently, the paste-like active material flows such that the inner rib of the current collector is not exposed but covered with the paste-like active material on the lower surface side of the electrode.The first to third forming roller apparatuses may each include a load control device. The load control device may controllably apply a load in a direction toward the filled electrode to each of ends of a rotary shaft of the at least one roller. Specifically, the load control device of the first forming roller apparatus may control the loads such that the load applied to the end of the rotary shaft located on the first area side is higher than the load applied to the end of the rotary shaft located on the second area side. The load control device of the second forming roller apparatus may control the loads such that the load applied to the end of the rotary shaft located on the second area side is higher than the load applied to the end of the rotary shaft located on the first area side. The load control device of the third forming roller apparatus may control the loads such that the loads applied to both of the ends of the rotary shaft are equal to each other.For example, the load control device of each of the first and second forming roller apparatuses may control the loads such that a maximum load is applied to one of the ends of the rotary shaft and a minimum load is applied to the other of the ends of the rotary shaft. In this case, the load control device of the third forming roller apparatus may control the loads such that a maximum load is applied to each of the ends of the rotary shaft.Controlling the press loads in this way enhances the flowability of the paste-like active material. This facilitates covering the inner rib included in the current collector with the paste-like active material on the lower surface side of the electrode.The pair of rollers apply a pressure not only to the paste-like active material but also to the current collector. When a pressure is applied to the current collector, the current collector may be deformed. Thus, the outer peripheral portion of the other roller in the pair of rollers of each of the first to third forming roller apparatuses may also be formed by an elastic material. In this case, the hardness of the outer peripheral portion of the one roller is preferably lower than the hardness of the outer peripheral portion of the other roller.With such a configuration, a portion of the one roller that contacts the current collector is concavely deformed by a pressure applied when the portion contacts the filled surface of the electrode, and the remaining portion of the one roller is projected inwardly of an area defined by the frame rib and the inner rib of the current collector. Therefore, the paste-like active material is squeezed or forced from the filled surface toward the lower surface of the electrode. Thus, it is possible to cause the paste-like active material fed from the upper surface of the electrode to flow to the lower surface of the electrode.The elastic material forming the outer peripheral portion of the one roller preferably has a thickness of 40 mm or more. If the elastic material forming the outer peripheral portion of the one roller is too thin, only a small pressing force is applied to the paste-like active material. Thus, with the elastic material having a thickness of 40 mm or more, a sufficient pressing force may be provided.A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings.  schematically shows an apparatus  for manufacturing a paste-type electrode of lead-acid battery according to the embodiment. The manufacturing apparatus  includes a belt conveyor  that transfers a current collector , a filler  including a hopper  containing a paste-like active material, and a pressing apparatus . The pressing apparatus  includes a first forming roller apparatus , a second forming roller apparatus , and a third forming roller apparatus .The current collector  used in the embodiment is made from a lead alloy which contains lead as its main raw material as well as tin, calcium, antimony, sodium, or the like. It is preferable that the lead alloy contains both tin and calcium. This is because addition of calcium reduces the rate of self-discharge. However, addition of calcium tends to corrode the current collector. Addition of tin suppresses corrosion of the current collector.is a plan view of the current collector  used in the embodiment. The current collector  is formed by relatively thick frame rib  having a rectangular shape and inner ribs  that are relatively thinner than the frame rib  and that are unitarily disposed inside the frame rib  to form a grid shape. The cross-sectional shapes of the frame rib  and the inner ribs  are not specifically limited, but are preferably such that the frame rib  and the inner ribs  contact the paste-like active material over a wide area and such that the paste-like active material is easily filled around the frame rib  and the inner ribs . More specifically, the frame rib  and the inner rib  may each have a diamond-like or hexagonal cross-sectional shape that is longer in the thickness direction. Although the cross-sectional shape and the dimensions of the frame rib  and the inner rib  are not limited to those of the embodiment, it is preferable that at least end surfaces of the inner ribs  in the thickness direction that do not face the filler  should be determined to be located more inward than an imaginary plane including end surface of the frame rib  in the thickness direction that do not face the filler .The current collector  may be manufactured by a gravity die casting (GDC) process, a continuous casting process, an expansion process, a punching process, or the like. The current collector  according to the embodiment is manufactured by the gravity die casting process. In the gravity die casting process, there is no theoretical limit to the thickness of grid ribs to be cast. In addition, the gravity die casting process facilitates the manufacture of a current collector with both thick inner ribs and thin inner ribs, which provides the current collector with excellent current collecting properties and corrosion resistance.More specifically, the gravity die casting process is a casting process including melting a metal (alloy) as a raw material of the current collector and pouring the molten raw material metal (alloy) into a die that can withstand the temperature of the molten metal by gravity.The paste-like active material used in the embodiment is fed to and held by the current collector. The preparation of the paste-like active material is not specifically limited. For example, a paste-like active material fabricated by kneading lead powder containing lead monoxide, water, sulfuric acid, and so forth (occasionally with additives such as cut carbon fiber pieces, carbon powder, lignin, barium sulfate, and red lead depending on the properties of positive and negative electrodes) may be used. The amount of the paste-like active material fed to the current collector may be such that the inner ribs are completely buried, and is desirably such that the thickness of the paste-like active material reaches the thickness of the frame rib or more.A plurality of current collectors  are placed on the belt conveyor  to be sequentially transferred to the filler . The filler  including the hopper  containing the paste-like active material fills the current collector  with the paste-like active material to obtain a filled electrode  when the current collector  passes below the filler . As shown in FIG. 1 of Patent Document 2, for example, the filler  may discharge the paste-like active material downward using a pair of pressing rollers that rotate in a different direction each other to fill the current collector  with the paste-like active material when the current collector  passes below the filler . The specific configuration of the filler  is not relevant to the gist of the present invention, and thus is not described here.The filled electrode  obtained by filling the current collector  with the paste-like active material is transferred to the pressing apparatus  which performs a pressing process. The pressing apparatus  according to the embodiment includes one first forming roller apparatus , one second forming roller apparatus , and one third forming roller apparatus . The third forming roller apparatus  is disposed at the end of a row of the first to third forming roller apparatuses  to  arranged in the transfer direction. If there are a plurality of the respective forming roller apparatuses, the third forming roller apparatus  is disposed at the end of the row.schematically shows the configuration of the first forming roller apparatus . The first forming roller apparatus  according to the embodiment includes a pair of rollers  and , a pair of air cylinders  and , and a load control device . The roller  is formed by a shaft portion and a roller body mounted around the shaft portion . The roller  is a so-called upper roller that contacts the upper electrode surface, namely the filled surface, of the electrode surfaces of the filled electrode . The roller  is formed by a shaft portion and a roller body mounted around the shaft portion . The roller  is a so-called lower roller that contacts an electrode surface of the filled electrode  that does not face the filler  (the lower electrode surface). The outer peripheral portion of each of the roller bodies and of the rollers  and  is formed by an elastic material.Rubber may be used as the elastic material. Examples of the robber that may be used as the elastic material include SBR (styrene butadiene rubber), BR (butadiene rubber), IR (isoprene rubber), EPM (ethylene propylene rubber), EPDM (ethylene propylene diene rubber), NBR (nitrile rubber), chloroprene rubber, IIR (butyl rubber), urethane rubber, silicone rubber, polysulfide rubber, nitrile hydroxide rubber, fluoro rubber, tetrafluoroethylene propylene rubber, tetrafluoroethylene propylene vinylidene fluoride rubber, acrylic rubber, chlorosulfonated polyethylene rubber, epichlorohydrin rubber, ethylene acrylic rubber, liquid rubber, an olefinic thermoplastic elastomer, a urethane thermoplastic elastomer, a polyester thermoplastic elastomer, a polyamide thermoplastic elastomer, a vinyl chloride thermoplastic elastomer, and a fluorinated thermoplastic elastomer. The use of chloroprene rubber (neoprene rubber) makes the resulting roller bodies highly resistant to acids, and is therefore particular preferable. In the embodiment, the hardness of the outer peripheral portion of the roller body of the upper roller  is lower than the hardness of the outer peripheral portion of the roller body of the lower roller .In the first forming roller apparatus  according to the embodiment, as shown in , the gap between the upper roller  and the lower roller  is not constant. Specifically, an electrode width direction (also referred to as an electrode lateral direction herein and in the drawings) is defined as a direction perpendicular to a direction which is perpendicular to a transfer direction in which the filled electrode  is transferred and also perpendicular to the electrode surface. The gap between the upper roller  and the lower roller  becomes gradually wider from a first area of the electrode surface located on one side in the width direction [a left-side area of the electrode surface on the page of ] toward a second area of the electrode surface located on the other side in the width direction [a right-side area of the electrode surface on the page of ].The air cylinder  pushes an end of the shaft portion of the upper roller , which is located on the first area side, toward the filled electrode  in accordance with an output command from the load control device . The air cylinder  pushes an end of the shaft portion of the upper roller , which is located on the second area side, toward the filled electrode  in accordance with an output command from the load control device . The load control device  outputs the output commands for driving and controlling the air cylinders  and  such that the load applied to the end of the shaft portion located on the first area side [left side in ] is higher than the load applied to the end of the shaft portion located on the second area side [right side in ].schematically shows the configuration of the second forming roller apparatus . As shown in , the second forming roller apparatus  according to the embodiment includes a pair of rollers  and , a pair of air cylinders  and , and a load control device . The configuration of the second forming roller apparatus  is the same as the configuration of the first forming roller apparatus , and thus is not described here. In the second forming roller apparatus , as shown in , the gap between the upper roller  and the lower roller  becomes gradually narrower from a first area of the electrode surface located on one side in the width direction [an area on the left side as seen on the sheet surface of ] toward a second area of the electrode surface located on the other side in the width direction [a right-side area on the page of ]. In order to create this state, the load control device  of the second forming roller apparatus  outputs output commands for driving and controlling the air cylinders  and  such that the load applied to the end of a shaft portion located on the second area side [right side in ] is higher than the load applied to the end of the shaft portion located on the first area side [left side in ].schematically shows the configuration of the third forming roller apparatus . As shown in , the third forming roller apparatus  includes a pair of rollers  and , a pair of air cylinders  and , and a load control device . The configuration of the third forming roller apparatus  is also the same as the configuration of the first forming roller apparatus  and the second forming roller apparatus , and thus is not described here. In the third forming roller apparatus , as shown in , the gap between the upper roller  and the lower roller  is constant. The load control device  of the third forming roller apparatus  outputs output commands for driving and controlling the air cylinders  and  such that the loads applied to both of the ends of a shaft portion are equal to each other.In the embodiment, as shown in Table 1 below, the load control device  of the first forming roller apparatus  controls the loads such that the air cylinder  applies a maximum load to the end of the shaft portion located on the side of the first area [area of the electrode surface on the left side in ] and the air cylinder  applies a minimum load (for example, zero) to the end of the shaft portion located on the side of the second area [area of the electrode surface on the right side in ]. The load control device  of the second forming roller apparatus  controls the loads such that the air cylinder  applies a minimum load (for example, zero) to the end of the shaft portion located on the side of the first area [area of the electrode surface on the left side in ] and the air cylinder  applies a maximum load to the end of the shaft portion located on the side of the second area [area of the electrode surface on the right side in ]. The load control device  of the third forming roller apparatus  controls the loads such that the air cylinder  and the air cylinder  respectively apply a maximum load to the end of the shaft portion located on the side of the first area [area of the electrode surface on the left side in ] and to the end of the shaft portion located on the side of the second area [area of the electrode surface on the right side in FIG. C].In the embodiment, the maximum load is achieved with the air cylinder applying a pressure of 0.5 MPa, and the minimum load, or zero load, is achieved with the air cylinder applying a pressure of 0 MPa so that no pressure is applied by air (only a pressure due to the own weight of the roller is applied). Controlling the loads in this way maximizes the flowability of the paste-like active material.Next, a process in which the pressing apparatus  presses the electrode surface of the filled electrode  in the embodiment will be described. The filled electrode  transferred to the pressing apparatus  is first subjected to a first pressing step performed by the first forming roller apparatus . In the first pressing step, the first area of the electrode surface located on one side in the width direction of the electrode is intensively (mainly) pressed.When the first pressing step is finished, the filled electrode  is subjected to a second pressing step performed by the second forming roller apparatus . In the second pressing step, the second area opposite to the first area is intensively (mainly) pressed.When the second pressing step is finished, the filled electrode  is subjected to a third pressing step performed by the third forming roller apparatus . In the third pressing step, the first and second areas are pressed over their entirety.In the first and second pressing steps, the paste-like active material fed to the filled electrode  flows in the width direction from the area which is intensively pressed toward the area which is not intensively pressed. Then, in the third pressing step which terminates the pressing step, the amount of the paste-like active material on the filled electrode  becomes substantially equal over the entire width of the filled electrode .When the pressing step is performed in this way, portions of the elastic peripheral surface of the outer peripheral portion of each of the roller bodies , , and of the upper rollers , , and  that contact the current collector  are concavely deformed by a pressure applied when such portions contact the upper electrode surface (filled surface) of the filled electrode . The remaining portions of each of the roller bodies , , and that do not contact the current collector  are projected (engaged) inwardly of areas defined (surrounded) by the frame ribs  and the inner ribs  of the current collector . Thus, the paste-like active material is squeezed or forced from the filled surface toward the opposite surface. In the embodiment, in particular, the hardness of each of the roller bodies , , and of the upper rollers , , and  is lower than the hardness of the roller bodies , , and of the lower rollers , , and . That is, the outer peripheral portions of the roller bodies of the upper rollers are softer than the outer peripheral portions of the roller bodies of the lower rollers. Therefore, the gap formed between the inner ribs  and the outer peripheral portion of each of the roller bodies , , and of the lower rollers , , and  can be made larger than the gap formed between the inner ribs  and the outer peripheral portion of each of the roller bodies , , and of the upper rollers , , and . This allows the paste-like active material fed to the filled surface to flow to the lower surface of the electrode opposite to the filled surface. Thus, the inner ribs  of the current collector  can be sufficiently covered with the paste-like active material on the side opposite to the filled surface.Rubber with a Shore hardness A of 40 may be used for the upper rollers, and rubber with a Shore hardness A of 60 may be used for the lower rollers, for example. The thickness of the rubber is preferably uniform so that no unintentional pressure is applied during pressing of the filled electrode, and is preferably 40 mm or more. Rubber with a thickness in this range can sufficiently squeeze or force the paste-like active material and transfer a pressure without a loss.If there is a sufficient installation space, a plurality of the first forming roller apparatuses, a plurality of the second forming roller apparatus, and/or a plurality of the third forming roller apparatuses may be disposed in the transfer path, and may be arranged in any order. However, it is preferable that the third forming roller apparatus is disposed at the end of the row of roller apparatuses in the transfer direction.is a cross-sectional view taken along the line A-A′ of . In the embodiment, as shown in , the inner ribs (-, -) of the current collector  are formed to be thinner than the frame rib , and the geometry of the inner ribs (-, -) disposed inside the frame rib  is determined such that the inner ribs (-, -) are located more inward than two imaginary planes each including both end surfaces of the frame rib  in the thickness direction. This makes it possible to form a gap not only between the outer peripheral surface of each of the roller bodies , , and of the upper rollers , , and  and the inner ribs (-, -) but also between the outer peripheral surface of each of the roller bodies , , and of the lower rollers , , and  and the inner ribs (-, -) when the filled electrode  passes through the first to third forming roller apparatuses  to , which facilitates the flow of the paste-like active material. As a result, end surfaces of the inner ribs (-, -) of the current collector  can be further favorably covered with the paste-like active material particularly on the lower surface side of the filled electrode .There may not necessarily be a gap formed between the outer peripheral surface of each of the roller bodies , , and of the upper rollers , , and  and the thick inner ribs (-).The current collector  described above was filled with the paste-like active material using the method and the apparatus according to the embodiment described above with reference to  to manufacture a filled electrode . That is, the current collector  was filled with the paste-like active material when the current collector  passed through the filler  to form the filled electrode . The filled electrode  was transferred to the pressing apparatus  to be subjected to the pressing step. In the pressing step, rollers with a peripheral surface made of a rubber material were used as the upper rollers , , and  and the lower rollers , , and  of the first to third forming roller apparatuses  to . The rubber material for the upper rollers was neoprene rubber (Shore hardness A: 40) with a thickness of 40 mm. The rubber material for the lower rollers was neoprene rubber (Shore hardness A: 60) with a thickness of 40 mm. The air cylinder  and the air cylinder  of the first forming roller apparatus  were caused to produce pressing forces of 0.5 MPa and 0 MPa, respectively. The air cylinder  and the air cylinder  of the second forming roller apparatus  were caused to produce pressing forces of 0 MPa and 0.5 MPa, respectively. The air cylinders  and  of the third forming roller apparatus  were each caused to produce a pressing force of 0.5 MPa.The first forming roller apparatus  caused the paste-like active material on the filled electrode  to flow toward the lower surface opposite to the filled surface and. At the same time, the first forming roller apparatus  caused the paste-like active material to flow from the area corresponding to the air cylinder , which generated a large pressing force, toward the area corresponding to the air cylinder , which generated a small pressing force. A portion of the roller body of the upper roller  that did not contact the frame rib  of the current collector  was fitted into a space surrounded by the frame rib  because of the elasticity of the rubber material. The degree of fitting at the area corresponding to the air cylinder  was greater than the degree of fitting at the area corresponding to the air cylinder , which caused the paste-like active material to flow. Next, in the pressing performed by the second forming roller apparatus , contrary to the pressing performed by the first forming roller apparatus , the fitting condition of the portion of the roller body of the roller  into the internal space surrounded by the frame rib  is greater at the area corresponding to the air cylinder  than at the area corresponding to the air cylinder . Thus, the paste-like active material is caused to flow in the opposite direction to the flow caused by the first forming roller apparatus . The air cylinder  and the air cylinder  of the third forming roller apparatus  were caused to produce the same pressing force, which made the paste-like active material on the filled electrode  substantially uniform.In the pressing step of Example 1 described above, the first forming roller apparatus  and the second forming roller apparatus  were omitted so that the filled electrode  was pressed using only the third forming roller apparatus . The process for Comparative Example 1 was otherwise the same as that for Example 1.The electrode manufactured in accordance with Example 1 described above and the electrode manufactured in accordance with Comparative Example 1 were checked on the lower surface opposite to the filled surface to which the paste-like active material was fed. In the electrode according to Example 1, both the thick inner ribs - and the thin inner ribs - were reliably buried or embedded in the active material (see ). In the electrode according to Comparative Example 1, on the other hand, it was found that the filling performance of the active material was insufficient, and that the thick inner ribs - were partly exposed to the surface opposite to the filled surface.  shows a state in which the thick inner ribs - are exposed. If the frame rib is thick (5.8 mm) and the thick inner rib are thick (5.4 mm), the lower surface opposite to the filled surface can be filled with the paste-like active material in the embodiment of the present invention.According to the present invention, before the fed paste-like active material is hardened, an electrode surface is pressed with pressing pressure changing along the width direction of the electrode which is perpendicular to the direction in which the electrode is transferred, in order to cause the paste-like active material to flow. As the result, it is possible to manufacture an electrode in which inner ribs of a current collector is favorably covered with a paste-like active material on the lower surface side of the electrode."

                "The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/161,488, filed Mar. 19, 2009.Not applicable.Not applicable.1. Field of the InventionThe disclosure relates generally to a system and method for offshore wind turbine installation; and more specifically is related to a system and method for offshore wind turbine installation with an offshore structure, such as a floating structure.2. Description of the Related ArtThe use of offshore wide turbines is becoming an increasing feasible and desirable form of power generation. In implementing the concept of windmills, the larger the turbine motor, generally the more power is generated. Thus, massive structures are being and have been built. It is recognized that some of these structures are 50 meters (m) to 100 m tall and weigh 500 metric tonnes.Currently, wind turbines installed offshore typically involve the use of cranes to lift the tower, turbine, and turbine blades into position. Offshore crane barges and services can be expensive. When considering multiple turbine units, the multiple lifts, and crane assets deployed, it can add considerable cost to the offshore installation when compared to land-based installation, and therefore affect overall commercial viability of the offshore wind turbine installation.An alternative to the use of cranes is offered in US Publ. No. 2004/0169376. The technical field of the US Publ. No. 2004/0169376 is that of making, transporting, and installing wind generators for producing electricity, more particularly offshore, and in large numbers, so as to form wind “farms”. The wind generator of the US Publ. No. 2004/0169376 comprises a wind turbine, a deployable telescopic pylon or support supporting the turbine, and a gravity base supporting the pylon or support. US Publ. No. 2004/0169376 teaches that a wind turbine is preassembled on a floating structure with the blades connected to the turbine and the turbine connected to the tower. The floating structure is transported in an upright orientation with the telescopic support compacted to the site of installation. The floating structure is ballasted and becomes a gravity base that supports the preassembled wind turbine, and the telescopic support is deployed to a full length. A challenge with this kind of procedure can be the instability during the transportation and cost of installing, maintaining, and later moving the wind turbine.There remains then a need for a offshore wind turbine and method for making the same that will improve the above challenges of current methods for offshore wind turbine installation.The disclosure provides a method and system for installing components for an offshore wind turbine assembly independent of cranes and derricks. The components are stored in an offshore structure, such as a Spar. After transporting the offshore structure horizontally to a site, the structure can be uprighted to a vertical orientation. A variable ballast component coupled to a tower of the wind turbine assembly can reciprocally retract the tower into the offshore structure to lower the tower, and extend the tower away from the offshore structure to raise the tower until the full quantity of blades are assembled to a turbine coupled to the tower. When the blades are stored in a peripheral fashion around the tower, the method and system provides for automatic rotational indexing of the tower as the tower and turbine retract and extend, so the turbine is progressively aligned with each blade to be installed.The disclosure provides a method of installing a wind turbine assembly using an offshore structure, the wind turbine assembly comprising a tower coupled to a turbine, comprising: storing the tower coupled to the turbine at least partially within the offshore structure; storing a first blade and a second blade at least partially within the offshore structure; coupling the first blade to the turbine at a first turbine position with the tower in a rotational first tower position; extending the tower coupled with the first blade from the offshore structure; rotating the turbine to a second turbine position different than the first turbine position; retracting the tower coupled to the turbine at least partially within the offshore structure; rotating the tower to the second tower position different than the first tower position; coupling a second blade to the turbine at the second turbine position with the tower at the second tower position; and extending the tower with the turbine coupled with the first blade and the second blade from the offshore structure.The disclosure also provides a method of installing a wind turbine assembly using a offshore structure, the wind turbine assembly comprising a tower coupled to a turbine, the tower further being coupled to a variable ballast component, comprising: storing the tower coupled to the turbine at least partially within the offshore structure with the variable ballast component at least partially ballasted; storing a first blade at least partially within the offshore structure; coupling the first blade to the turbine at a first turbine position with the tower in a rotational first tower position; and extending the tower with the turbine coupled with the first blade from the offshore structure by at least partially deballasting the variable ballast component.The disclosure further provides a wind turbine assembly installation system, comprising: an offshore structure; a tower coupled to a turbine and having a variable ballast component that is at least partially ballasted when the tower is retracted into the offshore structure and at least partially deballasted when the tower is extended from the well; and at least a first blade stored at least partially within the offshore structure, the first blade being decoupled from the tower and adapted to be coupled to the tower when the tower is at least partially retracted into the offshore structure.The Figures described above and the written description of specific structures and functions below are not presented to limit the scope of what Applicant has invented or the scope of the appended claims.

The components are stored in an offshore structure, such as a Spar. After transporting the offshore structure horizontally to a site, the structure can be uprighted to a vertical orientation. A variable ballast component coupled to a tower of the wind turbine assembly can reciprocally retract the tower into the offshore structure to lower the tower, and extend the tower away from the offshore structure to raise the tower until the full quantity of blades are assembled to a turbine coupled to the tower.

A wind turbine installation system  includes a wind turbine assembly  coupled with an offshore structure . The wind turbine assembly  can include, but is not limited to, a wind generator, a wind turbine, a wind power unit (WPU), a wind energy converter (WEC), or an aerogenerator. The wind turbine assembly  can be coupled to the offshore structure  in the installed position. The wind turbine assembly  generally includes a tower , a turbine  coupled to the tower, and a plurality of blades , ,  coupled to the turbine. The turbine  generally has a horizontal axis of rotation about which a plurality of the blades rotate. Present commercial embodiments of wind turbine assemblies often use three blades. However, the number of blades can vary. As described above in the background section, such commercial wind turbine assemblies can be massive structures that are 50 meters (m) to 100 m tall and weigh 500 metric tones. The tower  is designed of sufficient height and strength to support the stationary and dynamic loading of the other components. The turbine  is used to convert the rotational energy of the blades into electrical energy. The blades are aerodynamically designed to efficiently use wind currents to cause the turbine to rotate.The offshore structure  can include, without limitation, a offshore structure, a fixedly positioned structure, a platform, a topsides, and other offshore suited structures. Examples without limitation of a floating structure include, a Spar, tension leg platform (TLP), miniaturized semi-submersible platforms, and others. For purposes of illustration, a Spar offshore structure will be illustrated with the understanding that the offshore structure can vary, as stated above, using the underlying principles disclosed herein. A Spar is a floating sea platform typically used in very deep waters. A Spar generally includes a large cylinder or hull  that does not extend all the way to the seabed , but instead is moored by a number of mooring lines . Typically, about 90% of the Spar hull is underwater with an upper portion for the hull providing the ability of the Spar to float above a sea surface . A Spar provides both a stable structure in a horizontal position, such as during transportation to the installation site, as well as a stable structure after uprighting the Spar to a vertical position for installation of the wind turbine assembly. One or more heave plates , , can be coupled to a lower part of the hull  that is exposed to the sea currents to reduce the vertical motion of the Spar and assist the Spar's stability when upright. Examples of Spars are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,558,467 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,817,309, which is incorporated by reference. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that any suitable offshore platform is considered within the scope of the invention.is a perspective view schematic diagram of the exemplary embodiment in  illustrating the offshore structure with a plurality of blade wells.  is an enlarged view of a tower well with tower guide rails shown in .  is a perspective view schematic diagram illustrating the embodiment of  with the tower well located in the offshore structure. The figures will be described in conjunction with each other.In at least one embodiment, a tower well  is formed within the offshore structure  and particularly the hull . The tower well  can be cylindrical and can be used to store the tower  and turbine  coupled to the tower. The tower well  can be disposed advantageously in a transverse central portion of the hull, so that blades , ,  can be disposed around a periphery of the offshore structure, as described below. However, it is understood that other locations of the tower well  can be used. Thus, for purposes herein the tower  and blades , ,  are described as being stored or located at least partially within the offshore structure , wherein the term “within” is broadly defined to include located inside a perimeter boundary of the offshore structure or in structural reach of the offshore structure such as by outriggers or extension arms extending outward from the offshore structure.The tower well  can serve to guide the tower  during the installation. In at least one embodiment using three blades, three vertical guide rails , ,  are positioned around the periphery of the tower well , such as approximately every 120 degrees. Further, three helical guide rails , ,  can be positioned around the periphery of the tower well . The vertical guide rails , ,  can be coupled with the helical guide rails , , . Specially, an upper portion of the helical guide rail  can be coupled with an upper portion of the vertical guide rail  and a lower portion of the helical guide rail  can be coupled with a lower portion of the vertical guide rail . An upper portion of the helical guide rail  can be coupled with an upper portion of the vertical guide rail  and a lower portion of the helical guide rail  can be coupled with a lower portion of the vertical guide rail . An upper portion of the helical guide rail  can be coupled with an upper portion of the vertical guide rail  and a lower portion of the helical guide rail  can be coupled with a lower portion of the vertical guide rail .Further, one or more blade wells , ,  can be disposed about a periphery of the tower well . The blades , ,  can be stored in these blade wells , , , such as during transportation to the installation site. The position of the blade wells can advantageously be coordinated with the spacing and position of the guide rails, such as approximately every 120 degrees if the number of blades is three and the spacing is uniformly distributed. Other numbers of guide rails and spacing of the guide rails can be used and are generally coordinated with the number of blades to be installed with the turbine. Further, non-uniform spacings can be used.The tower can be slidably coupled with the guide rails. As the tower is extended and retracted, it traverses up and down relative to the offshore structure and specifically the tower well in this embodiment. As the tower traverses up and down, the tower can progressively engage the helical guide rails and can be automatically indexed to a new rotational tower position each cycle. The resulting rotational tower positions can be coordinated with a location of each blade that is to be coupled to the tower and specifically the turbine. In more detail, the tower can be initially coupled to a first blade at a first tower position aligned with the vertical guide rail . The tower can be extended using the vertical guide rail . As the tower is retracted back into the tower well along an upper portion of the vertical guide rail , the tower can engage the helical guide rail  and is rotated into a new indexed position of the tower (that is, a second tower position that is different than the first tower position) until engaging a lower portion of the vertical guide rail . At that position, advantageously, the turbine coupled to the tower is aligned to be coupled to a second blade. The second blade can be coupled to the turbine, and the tower is extended using the vertical guide rail . As the tower is retracted back into the tower well along an upper portion of the vertical guide rail , the tower can engage the helical guide rail  and is rotated into a new indexed position of the tower (that is, a third tower position that is different than the first tower position and second tower position) until engaging a lower portion of the vertical guide rail . At that position, advantageously, the turbine is aligned to be coupled to a third blade. The third blade can be coupled and the tower extended with all blades mounted. Final installation procedures can be accomplished and the wind turbine assembly can begin functioning.If the wind turbine assembly needs to be maintained, disassembled, or moved to another site, the tower can be retracted back into the tower well along an upper portion of the vertical guide rail . The tower can engage the helical guide rail  and is rotated into a new indexed position of the tower (that is, the first tower position that is different than the second tower position and third tower position) until engaging a lower portion of the vertical guide rail . The turbine can be maintained, components replaced, and so forth. If one or more blades need to be replaced or otherwise disassembled, the blades can be decoupled and stored for example in the blade wells by continuing the process of retracting and extending the tower. Further, the blade can be inspected as it is retracted into the blade well or withdrawn from the blade well.Further, the turbine will generally be rotated to new positions relative to its generally horizontal axis of rotation for each coupling of the blades. For example, the turbine will be in a first turbine position when the first blade is coupled to the turbine. Upon extending the tower with the turbine and first blade, when the assembly has sufficient clearance, the turbine will be rotated so that the turbine is in a second turbine position that can be aligned with a stored second blade for coupling thereto. The first blade would therefore not be aligned with the stored second blade. Similarly, the turbine would be rotated to a third turbine position when the tower is extended and has sufficient clearance, so that the third blade can be coupled to the turbine.is a perspective view schematic diagram illustrating an offshore structure with a plurality of blade wells for storing a plurality of blades. The offshore structure  can include the hull  with the tower well  and surrounding blade wells , , . Due to the large size, most of the fabricating for the offshore structure, the tower, blades, and other components is done is a horizontal position as shown.During the fabrication, typically on the fabrication yard , the blades , ,  can be installed in a frame , , , respectively. The frame can be used to package and protect the blades. Each frame with a blade can be installed and stored on the blade wells , , . The blades can be oriented in the blade wells to align with an installation of the blades to the turbine at a later time. Although not expressly shown, the blade wells can also include guide rails to assist the orientation of the blade and/or frames. The tower  and the turbine  can also be installed and stored in the offshore structure , such as a hull , as shown in .is a schematic diagram illustrating the offshore structure with stored wind turbine assembly components before an installation of the blades with a turbine coupled to a tower, the tower being at least partially retracted in the offshore structure, and a variable ballast component coupled to the tower.

The variable ballast component  can be an air can or tank coupled to a lower portion of the tower, such as a bottom of the tower. By selectively ballasting (that is, flooding with fluid) the variable ballast component , the tower and other associated components can be retracted into the offshore structure . By selectively deballasting (that is, expunging fluid) the variable ballast component , the tower can be extended from the offshore structure . Other types of ballast components and ballast can be used as would be known to those in the art that can be varied in ballast to assist in retracting and extending the tower relative to the offshore platform. Water and air can be used for ballasting and deballasting as the tower is reciprocally retracted within and extended from the offshore structure. In some embodiments, it can be advantageous to provide a fluid with a different density than the water. Different density fluids can include, without limitation, heavier fluids used as “mud” drilling fluids.

                "The U.S. Government has a paid-up license in this invention and the right in limited circumstances to require the patent owner to license others on reasonable terms as provided for by the terms of contract No. DE-FC26-05NT42644 awarded by the Department of Energy.The present invention relates to the field of metallurgy, and, more particularly, to combustion turbine components having surface cooling features and associated methods.A combustion turbine typically includes, in a serial flow relationship, a compressor section to compress the entering airflow, a combustion section in which a mixture of fuel and the compressed air is burned to generate a propulsive gas flow, and a turbine section that is rotated by the propulsive gas flow. After passing through the turbine section, the propulsive gas flow exits the engine through a diffuser section. In ground based combustion turbines used for electricity generation, power is normally extracted from the rotating shaft to drive an electrical power generator.A component of such a combustion turbine may advantageously be precisely formed and may take a variety of complicated shapes. Some current methods of combustion turbine component formation include casting and forging.Casting is a manufacturing process by which a liquid metal is poured into a mold, typically ceramic, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape to be formed. The liquid metal is allowed to solidify and the solid combustion turbine component casting is then ejected or broken out of the mold to complete the process. There may, however, be limitations on the size of the combustion turbine components that may be formed by casting. Likewise, there may be limitations on the size of surface features of the combustion turbine components that may be formed (e.g. it may not be possible to form surface features having dimensions below a certain size).Forging is the term for shaping metal by using localized compressive forces. A combustion turbine component formed by forging may be relatively strong and may have a fine grain structure. However, due to the fine grain structure, a forged combustion turbine component generally exhibits relatively low resistance to creep and may thus be unsuitable for use in certain applications Subsequent heat treatment can promote grain growth, however, and it is may be easier to control grain size in a forging than a casting. In addition, the formation of small surface features on such a combustion turbine component during the forging process may be difficult. Since forgings are generally solid shapes and cooling passages are later machined into the forging, it may be difficult to machine fine scale internal features on an internal surface of a cooling passage of a forging.As discussed above, due to process limitations and cost concerns, forming an entire combustion turbine component of a desired shape and having desired surface features by the above processes may be difficult or costly. Thus, attempts at forming combustion turbine subcomponents and joining the subcomponents together to form a whole combustion turbine component have been made.Some efforts have focused on welding. U.S. Pat. No. 7,337,940 to Subramanian et al., for example, discloses a method of manufacturing a combustion turbine component by friction stir welding a plurality of combustion turbine subcomponents together. The combustion turbine subcomponents are formed by conventional processes, such as casting or forging. However, some features may not be easily or cost effectively formed by casting or forging processes. In addition, some combustion turbine subcomponents may be constructed from materials that are not easily friction stir welded.Other efforts at joining combustion turbine subcomponents together to form a combustion turbine component have instead focused on brazing. U.S. Pat. No. 6,434,946 to Shaw et al. discloses a method of making a combustion turbine component by bonding a brazing alloy to the surfaces of two combustion turbine subcomponents to be joined together and assembling the two combustion turbine subcomponents. The assembly is then heated to a brazing temperature to form a braze joint between the combustion turbine subcomponents, thereby forming the combustion turbine component. However, a braze joint may be undesirable in some situations and may not provide as strong a bond as desired.In addition, the continuing effort to design and build more powerful and efficient combustion turbines has led to a desire for a component thereof to have enhanced high performance capabilities, such as heat transfer. Indeed, a component's ability to transfer heat away from itself is particularly important due to the high operating temperatures of combustion turbines.Newton's Law of Cooling states that the rate of heat loss of a body is proportional to both the difference in temperatures between the body itself and its environment and the surface area of the body. Therefore, one way to enhance the cooling capabilities of a combustion turbine component is to increase its surface area.U.S. Pat. Pub. 2008/0000611 to Bunker et al., for example, discloses a method of forming a casting mold that will be used to cast a combustion turbine component having a variety of surface cooling features, such as hemispheres, that increase the surface area of the combustion turbine component. The increased surface area provides the combustion turbine component with enhanced cooling capabilities. However, a combustion turbine component formed by casting and having an increased surface area may not be desirable in some applications. Furthermore, certain arrangements of surface cooling features may not be easily formed by casting techniques.U.S. Pat. No. 6,503,574 to Skelly et al. discloses a method for making a combustion turbine component having cooling grooves defined therein. A combustion turbine component substrate is formed by single crystal casting techniques and then a bond coating is formed on the combustion turbine component substrate. A pattern of three-dimensional recessed grooves is etched in the bond coating by photolithography and then a thermal barrier coating is formed on the bond coating. However, recessed grooves may not provide the desired cooling capabilities in some applications.Therefore, different methods of joining combustion turbine subcomponents together to form a combustion turbine component may be desirable. In addition, a combustion turbine component having increased surface area that is formed by joining a plurality of combustion turbine subcomponents together may also be desirable.In view of the foregoing background, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a combustion turbine component having a plurality of surface cooling features together with methods of making such a combustion turbine component.This and other objects, features, and advantages in accordance with the present invention are provided by a method of making a combustion turbine component comprising forming a metallic combustion turbine component body by direct metal fabrication (DMF). The metallic combustion turbine component body may be formed to have at least one surface portion defining a plurality of coarse surface cooling features each having a first dimension, and at least one fine surface cooling feature on at least one of the plurality of coarse surface cooling features and having a second dimension less than the first dimension and less than 200 μm. The cooling features increase the surface area of the combustion turbine component and thereby enhance its ability to transfer heat away from itself, improving high temperature performance.DMF advantageously allows for a greater variety of shapes to be formed than casting or forging. In addition, DMF allows the formation of smaller surface features than may be possible with conventional casting or forging processes.The at least one fine surface cooling feature may comprise a projection, such as a convex projection The at least one fine surface cooling feature may comprises a recess, such as a concave recess.The DMF may comprise tomo lithographic molding. Additionally or alternatively the DMF may comprise metal injection molding.Forming the metallic combustion turbine component body by DMF may include forming a plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies by DMF, each of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies comprising an activatable binder. The plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies may be assembled together to form a metallic greenbody assembly. The activatable binder may be activated. The metallic greenbody assembly may be sintered to thereby form the metallic body.The first dimension may be greater than 500 μm. At least one of the plurality of coarse surface cooling features may comprise a projection or a recess, for example.The metallic combustion turbine component body may comprise at least one of an oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloy, an intermetallic compound, and a refractory metal. Such materials may impart the combustion turbine component with various desirable propertiesAnother aspect is directed to a combustion turbine component comprising a metallic body having at least one surface portion defining a plurality of coarse cooling features each having a dimension greater than 500 μm. A plurality of fine cooling features, each having a dimension less than 200 μm, is on at least one of the plurality of coarse cooling features.The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.Referring initially to the flowchart  of , a first embodiment of a method of making a combustion turbine component is now described. After the start (Block ), at Block  a plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies are assembled together to form a metallic greenbody assembly. The metallic greenbody assembly has a shape closely resembling that of the final combustion turbine component, but has a greater porosity, a lesser density, and a larger size. The plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies may be assembled by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.Those of skill in the art will understand that a metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbody is an unsintered metallic combustion turbine subcomponent that lacks strength and has both a low density and high porosity compared to a sintered metallic body.At Block , the metallic greenbody assembly is sintered to thereby form the combustion turbine component. During sintering, the metallic greenbody assembly may shrink in all directions by up to 20%, thereby increasing in density. In addition, the porosity of the metallic greenbody assembly is reduced and the strength of the metallic greenbody assembly is increased.The sintering may be solid state sintering or liquid state sintering. During solid state sintering, the metallic greenbody assembly is heated to a temperature below the melting point of its constituents and held at that temperature until its particles adhere to each other. During liquid state sintering, the metallic greenbody assembly is heated until at least one but not all of its constituents melt and reach a liquid state.The metallic greenbody assembly may be placed under pressure during the sintering. In this case, the sintering may comprise hot isostatic pressing (HIP). HIP subjects a component to high gas pressure in a containment vessel. The pressurizing gas is preferably argon, although other inert gasses may be used as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art. The pressurizing gas is preferably applied between 100 and 310 MPa (15,000 p.s.i. and 45,000 p.s.i.) at a temperature of 480° C. to 2000° C., although other pressures and other temperatures may be used as well. As the containment vessel is heated during the HIP, the pressure inside increases. The pressure is isostatic because it is applied to the metallic greenbody assembly from all directions evenly. The pressure and heat during HIP helps to reduce internal voids in the metallic greenbody assembly through a combination of plastic deformation, creep, and diffusion bonding, thus increasing the density of the metallic greenbody assembly. Alternatively, the sintering may be performed without the metallic greenbody assembly being placed under pressure. Block  indicates the end of the method.After sintering, a bond coating may be formed on the combustion turbine component and a thermal barrier coating may be formed on the bond coating. Any number of exemplary bond coatings and thermal barrier coatings known to those of skill in the art may be used. In addition, the thermal barrier coating may be formed directly on the combustion turbine component, without an intervening bond coating. Additionally or alternatively, a wear resistant layer may be formed on the combustion turbine component.Those of skill in the art will understand that, in some embodiments, after sintering the combustion turbine component may be placed into a casting mold and that additional metallic layers may therefore be formed around the combustion turbine component, encasing it.In addition, it should be understood that a plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies may be assembled to form a metallic greenbody assembly and that the metallic greenbody assembly may be sintered to form a combustion turbine subcomponent assembly. Multiple combustion turbine subcomponent assemblies may be formed in this fashion and then joined together by conventional methods, such as welding or brazing, to form the combustion turbine component. The multiple combustion turbine subcomponent assemblies may also be placed into a casting mold and additional layers may be formed therearound to form a combustion turbine componentReferring now to the flowchart  of , a more detailed method of making a combustion turbine component is now described. After the start (Block ) at Block  a plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies are formed by direct metal fabrication (DMF).Direct metal fabrication processes include (1) layered powder build-up processes, such as selective laser sintering (SLS), (2) processes using light energy to chemically change a material, such as stereolithography (SLA), (3) deposition techniques that selectively deposit either particles or thin laminates, such as solid ground curing (SGC), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), fused deposition modeling (FDM), and ballistic particle manufacturing (BPM), and (4) powder metallurgy processes that tightly compact a metal powder into a mold or die, such as metal injection molding (MIM) or tomo lithographic molding. SLS, for example, uses a high powered laser to fuse the particles of a metal powder into a mass representing a desired three dimensional object, one layer at a time.The plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies may be formed by any of the above DMF processes, or by other processes known to those of skill in the art. In addition, each of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies may be formed by the same DMF process, or each may be formed by different DMF processes. For example, it may be advantageous for some of the metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies to be formed by SLA while others are formed by MIM.Each of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies in this embodiment may comprise an activatable binder and at least one of an oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloy, an intermetallic compound, and a refractory metal. Each of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies may also comprise a Nickel based superalloy and, optionally, at least one rare earth element. The activatable binder may comprise a polymer or plastic binder, a metallic mix including a melting point depressor, or another suitable binder known to those of skill in the art. Intermetallic compounds are solid phases containing two or more metallic elements, optionally having one or more non-metallic elements. Intermetallic phases form due to strong bonding between unlike metal atoms, this results in an ordered crystal structure, whereby the various atomic species occupy specific sublatice sites. Intermetallic compounds may also include interstitial compounds such as carbides and nitrides. Such intermetallic compounds offer advantageous properties like high temperature resistance and hardness. Refractory metals include tungsten, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and rhenium, and are extraordinarily resistant to heat and wear. The methods described herein allow the formation of combustion turbine components from the above materials, whereas conventional methods such as casting and forging may not. It should be noted that the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies may be metallic and not contain any ceramic.At Block , the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies are assembled together to form a metallic greenbody assembly. At Block , the activatable binder is activated. The activatable binder may be activated by heating the greenbody assembly, or may be activated by other suitable methods. After activation, the activatable binder may optionally be cured through the use of a chemical agent, ultraviolet radiation, bombardment with an electron beam, or further heating. Furthermore, the activatable binder may optionally be removed from the greenbody assembly by a pre-sintering heat treating at a temperature of 400° C. to 600° C., or at other suitable temperatures, or through the use of chemical agents. This pre-sintering heat treating, in some embodiments, may increase the density, decrease the porosity, and shrink the greenbody assembly.At Block , the metallic greenbody assembly is sintered to thereby form the combustion turbine component. Block  indicates the end of the method.With reference to the flowchart  of , an alternative embodiment of a method of making a combustion turbine component is now described. After the start (Block ), at Block , a plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies is formed by tomo lithographic molding. Tomo lithographic molding involves the production of a master tool which is then used either directly as a mold or die, or alternatively used to produce a secondary consumable mold. To create the master tool, a series of layers are fabricated with lithographic techniques. The layers are micro-machined to add additional features and details, and are then laminated together by brazing or epoxy bonding to form the master tool. The master tool may then be used as a mold or die for processes such as microcasting, microinjection molding, metal injection molding, and powder injection molding.It should be understood that the term tomo lithographic molding as used hereinafter is to mean the use of a master tool formed by tomo lithographic molding in conjunction with a suitable process to form metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies therefrom.At Block , the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies is assembled together and an activatable binder is positioned between adjacent ones of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies to form a metallic greenbody assembly. The activatable binder may be formed from the same material as the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies that has been mixed with a suitable binding agent, such as a polymer or plastic binder or a melting point depressor, such as boron. Alternatively, the activatable binder may be a metallic mix together with a melting point depressor.If the activatable binder includes a melting point depressor, the sintering may be liquid state sintering and the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies may bond together by transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding. If the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies is to be bonded together by TLP bonding, the activatable binder between each of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies is considered to be a TLP forming layer. The metallic greenbody assembly and thus the TLP forming layer are then heat treated at a temperature higher than the melting point of the TLP forming layer, but lower than the melting point of the other constituents of the metallic greenbody assembly. Accordingly, the TLP forming layer melts during the sintering.As the temperature remains constant, the melting point depressor diffuses from the TLP forming layer into each of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies, and molecules from each of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies diffuse into the TLP layer. As a result of this diffusion, the melting point of TLP layer increases beyond the temperature of the heat treatment and the TLP layer, now close in composition to the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies, resolidifies. The resulting bonded region between each of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies is thin and of a high strength.Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the activatable binder may be positioned between certain adjacent ones of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies but not between other adjacent ones of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies.At Block , the activatable binder is activated. At Block , the metallic greenbody assembly is sintered to thereby form the combustion turbine component. The combustion turbine component is devoid of an interface between adjacent ones of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies after sintering. This lack of interfaces may provide the combustion turbine component with increased strength and the metallurgical properties throughout may be consistent. Block  indicates the end of the method.Another embodiment of a method of making a combustion turbine component is now described with reference to the flowchart  of . After the start (Block ), at Block  a plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies is formed by metal injection molding. Metal injection molding involves injecting a metallic powder and a suitable binder into a mold, in some situations with conventional plastic injection molding machines and processes. The mold used with the metal injection molding may be formed by tomo lithographic molding or may be formed from other methods.At least one of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies is formed to have at least one internal cooling passage. This internal cooling passage is formed to have a plurality of internal surface features, each with a dimension less than 200 μm. As will be explained in detail below, this plurality of internal surface features increases the internal surface area of the cooling passages of the combustion turbine component and therefore enhances its ability to transfer heat away from itself. As will also be explained in detail below, each of the plurality of internal surface features may take a variety of shapes and may be either a projection or a recess.Of course, those of skill in the art will recognize that, in some applications, one of the metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies need not have internal cooling passages. In such applications, the surface features described herein may be external cooling features.At Block , the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies is assembled together to form a metallic greenbody assembly. At Block , the metallic greenbody assembly is sintered to thereby form the combustion turbine component. In this embodiment, the combustion turbine component has interfaces between adjacent ones of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies. Block  indicates the end of the method. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that, in some applications, there may be an interface between certain adjacent ones of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies after sintering and no interface between other adjacent ones of the plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies after sintering.With reference to , a combustion turbine component  having a plurality of internal surface cooling features  is now described.

As also shown in , the plurality of fine surface cooling features  illustratively comprises convex or hemispherical projections, and may be on the order of 50 μm, for example.The surface cooling features described herein increase the surface area of the internal surface portion  of the combustion turbine component , thereby enhancing its ability to transfer heat away from itself and cool itself and into a cooling fluid flowing therethrough. This enhanced heat transfer may allow for the size of the cooling passageways  to be decreased compared to those of conventional combustion turbine components. Furthermore, this enhanced heat transfer may allow for an amount of cooling fluid used to cool the combustion turbine component  to be reduced.A first additional surface cooling feature  comprising an “x” shaped projection is illustratively on the coarse surface cooling feature  and has a dimension greater than 200 μm. It should be understood that, although one first additional cooling feature  is shown, there may instead be a plurality of first additional surface cooling features on at least one of the plurality of coarse surface cooling features  and that ones of this plurality of first additional surface cooling features may be of sizes both greater than and less than 200 μm.A second additional surface cooling feature  comprising a circular-base pin and having a dimension less than 200 μm is illustratively on the first additional surface cooling feature .Those of skill in the art will recognize that there may be any number of stacked pluralities of surface cooling features (e.g. there may be a third plurality of additional surface cooling features on the second plurality of additional surface cooling features, and so on and so forth)Each of the plurality of coarse surface cooling features , plurality of fine surface cooling features , first additional plurality of surface cooling features , and second additional plurality of surface cooling features  may be projections of other suitable shapes, including but not limited to square-base pins, circular-base pins, square-base pyramids, circular base cones, tapered pins, polygonal-based pyramids, conical frustums, pyramidical frustums, convex cones, serpentine ribs, hemispheres, and combinations thereof.

Each of the plurality of coarse surface cooling features , plurality of fine surface cooling features , first additional plurality of surface cooling features , and second additional plurality of surface cooling features  may have the same shape, or each may have a different shape. For example, one of the plurality of fine surface cooling features  may be a convex hemispherical projection while another of the plurality of fine surface cooling features may be a concave square shaped recess.The metallic combustion turbine component body  may comprise at least one of an oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloy, an intermetallic compound, and a refractory metal. Advantages of construction from these materials are explained above. In addition, the metallic body  may comprise a plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent bodies bonded together, or a plurality of metallic combustion turbine subcomponent greenbodies bonded together, by methods described in detail above.An alternative embodiment of the surface cooling features in accordance with the present invention will now be described with reference to . One of a plurality of coarse surface cooling features  comprising a rectangular projection has a dimension greater than 500 μm, and a plurality of fine surface cooling features  comprising rectangular projections and having at least one dimension less than 200 μm is illustratively thereon.

                "This application constitutes a divisional of co-pending, commonly-owned U.S. application Ser. No. 12/035,363 filed on Feb. 21, 2008, the contents of which are incorporated by reference.This invention relates generally to compression springs and methods of making the same, and more specifically to compression springs having end portions with selectively contoured inner contact surfaces.Conventional compression springs are used in a variety of applications. By way of example,  shows one such application of a conventional compression spring  employed in a Detroit Locker® differential . In this type of application, the conventional compression spring  operates to bias the differential into an engaged or disengaged configuration.shows a cross-sectional view of another conventional compression spring  that takes the form of a round-wire helical compression spring wound about a longitudinal axis . The round-wire includes a wire diameter  formed about a mean spring diameter  with the various coils separated according to a desired pitch . In addition, the conventional compression spring  includes oppositely facing end surfaces ,  formed on respective end portions , . The oppositely facing end surfaces ,  may be ground or machined to be substantially planar or flat such that the end surfaces ,  of the spring  may be aligned and seated against a substantially planar or complementary surface. For example and briefly referring back to , the oppositely facing end portions ,  of the conventional compression spring  are seated, supported, or otherwise in contact with a substantially planar mating surfaces , . In many industries it is considered a common manufacturing practice to grind or machine down the oppositely facing end surfaces of a compression spring to enable the spring to be seated against a substantially planar surface.Nevertheless and again referring back to , inner facing surfaces ,  remain round or non-machined. In at least some types of compression springs and/or under certain loads, the inner facing surfaces ,  may contact the adjacent coil under compression. With the rounded spring wire, the upper contacting coil may want to roll off the lower contacting coil and in some cases may become caught or locked beneath a lower contacting coil. In addition, the contact may operate as a stress concentration point on the adjacent coil eventually damaging or even causing failure of the compression spring. Further, this contact may operate as a rocker or hard point to change the stress/strain distribution within the coils of the spring, which in turn may adversely affect various loading conditions and may affect the operational life of the spring.The present invention relates to compression springs and methods of making the same. More specifically and in one embodiment, the present invention relates to compression springs having end portions with selectively contoured inner contact surfaces to reduce contact stress and/or stress concentration effects on the adjacent coils when the compression spring is placed under load and the adjacent coil engages or contacts the end portion of the spring.In accordance with an aspect of the invention, a compression spring includes a coil body arranged in a helical configuration with a mean coil diameter relative to a coil axis. The coil body may be formed with round-wire having a wire diameter. An end portion of the coil body extends from the coil body and includes a thickness in a direction substantially parallel to the coil axis and where the thickness is less than the wire diameter. The thickness of the end portion is defined by a first surface facing substantially away from the coil body and a second surface facing substantially toward the coil body. In one embodiment, the second surface includes a grooved portion formed into the thickness of the end portion.In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method of making a compression spring includes the steps of (1) fixing the compression spring to a holder, the compression spring having an end portion extending from a coil body, the end portion having a thickness defined by a first surface facing substantially away from the coil body and a second surface facing substantially toward the coil body; (2) moving a cutter in proximity to, yet spaced apart from, the second surface of the end portion; (3) moving the holder to place the second surface of the end portion into contact with the cutter; and (4) machining the second surface to reduce the thickness of the end portion.As will be described in further detail below, at least one embodiment of the invention includes a compression spring having an end portion with a selectively contoured inner contact surface. By way of example, the contour or profile of the inner surface may take a variety of forms, such as a planar surface, a concave surface, a V-shaped surface, etc. One purpose of selectively contouring or shaping the inner contact surface of the end portion of the spring is to reduce the amount of contact stress on an adjacent coil of the spring when the coil is compressed to a state where the end portion contacts the adjacent coil. In one embodiment, the contoured inner surface allows the adjacent coil to be received in a groove or channel formed in the end portion when the inner surface of the end portion was correspondingly machined. The groove or channel formed in the end portion may substantially reduce the effects of the rocker or hard point action during spring compression as described above in the background.shows a compression spring  having a coil body  arranged in a helical configuration. The coil body  is formed about a coil axis  with a mean coil diameter  relative to the coil axis . In one embodiment, at least several coils of the coil body  are oriented to be substantially perpendicular to a helical axis , which is offset from the coil axis  by a helical angle . The coil body  takes the form of round-wire (i.e., circular) having a desired wire diameter . The round-wire is preferably steel wire and may be heat treated and/or peened to increase the strength and operational life of the spring .The spring  further includes end portions  that extend from the coil body . The end portions  have a thickness  defined by a direction substantially parallel to the helical axis . The thickness  of the end portions is defined by a first surface  facing substantially away from the coil body  and a second or inner surface  facing substantially toward the coil body . In addition, the thickness  of the end portions  is less than the wire diameter . For purposes of brevity, other structural aspects and features of compression springs, such as helical compression springs, may not be described in detail.According to one embodiment,  show the second surface  may be a non-circular surface, for example a planar surface as best illustrated in . The first surface , likewise, may retain the rounded profile corresponding to the round-wire of the coil body  or may be ground or machined to a planar surface as well.By way of example,  show several alternate embodiments for the shape of the second surface .  shows the second surface  as being a V-shaped or grooved surface.  shows the second surface  as being an arcuate or concave surface having a desired radius  taken from center point . The radius  is preferably slightly greater than a radius (i.e., half of the diameter ) of the round-wire coil body . Advantageously, the arcuate or concave surface  of the end portion  may reduce or eliminate the adjacent coil from rolling off under load because the surface  operates to complementarily receive and cradle the rounded coil body of the adjacent coil.Thus in , the end portion  of the coil body  takes the form of a concavo-convex end portion . Alternatively, it is appreciated that the second surface  may take other shapes, contours, or profiles other than those described above or shown in the respective drawings.shows a method  for making a compression spring  according to one embodiment of the present invention.  describes the various steps associated with making the compression spring  while  shows a system  used to manufacture the compression spring .Referring to , the compression spring  may be fixed to a holder . For example, the compression spring  may be clamped, pressed onto or otherwise attached to a rotatable holder , which in turn may take the form of a collet. The holder  may be coupled to a tool , such as a lathe or rotary table, for rotational and translational control of the holder . Thus in , step  for manufacturing the compression spring  includes fixing the compression spring  to the holder . Next, step  includes moving a cutter  into proximity to, but not in contact with an end portion  of the compression spring . In the illustrated embodiment of , the compression spring  includes two end portions , but only one of the end portions  is shown as coupled to the holder . Although the illustrated embodiment shows the right-side end portion  being processed independently from the left-side end portion , it is appreciated that both end portions  may be processed simultaneously or contemporaneously using additional holders  and cutters . The cutter  may take the form of a milling cutter, a drill bit, a grinding wheel, a diamond cutter, or some other equivalent type of cutting or machining instrument capable of removing an amount of metallic material from the end portion  of the compression spring .In a preferred embodiment, the holder , which is fixed to the compression spring , is translated approximately along the coil axis  () to bring the cutter  into contact with the end portion  of the compression spring . Hence in step , the holder  is linearly translated relative to the cutter  to place the second or inner surface  () into machining contact with the cutter . Lastly and in step , the second surface  () is machined to reduce the thickness  () of the end portion  and to further contour or shape the second surface  (). As described above, the shape of the second surface  may take a variety of forms, such as planar, grooved, or concave, for example. Once the end portion  has been machined, the compression spring  may be subjected to further treatments, such as being a heat treatment, shot peening, coating, etc. In addition, the compression spring  may be further processed by breaking off a free edge  of the end portion  and then chamfering the free edge . These latter steps may be accomplished with the milling cutter  by rotating or translating the holder  while the cutter  remains stationary.In another embodiment, the compression spring  may be hand held to place the second or inner surface  () into machining contact with a grinding belt, grinding wheel and/or a cutter . In one embodiment, the spring  is held and placed into machining contact with the grinding belt. In another embodiment, the spring  is clamped in a holder and a hand held cutter is used to contour or shape the second surface  ().While the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described, as noted above, many changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is not limited by the disclosure of the preferred embodiment. Instead, the invention should be determined by reference to the claims that follow."

                "This invention relates to razors, and particularly to improvements in razor cartridge components and manufacturing processes thereof.With more and more features being included in razor systems and razor cartridges, it may be desirable to provide processes for producing enhanced razor cartridge components which would improve shaving attributes, decorate, or provide information about razor components to the user.One such razor cartridge component, whether for male or female razor cartridges, is the lubricating body which generally provides added lubrication and comfort while shaving. Most lubricating bodies found on razor cartridges include a blend of polyethylene oxide and polystyrene. In male cartridges, the lubricating body is typically a lubricating strip (e.g., oftentimes referred to as a lube strip or lubrastrip) generally formed using an extrusion process. In female cartridges, such as those found in the Gillette® Venus® Embrace™ razor, the lubricating body may include a lubrication ring (e.g., lube ring) or as found in the Gillette® Venus® Embrace™ product, the lubricating body may include gel bars or soap wings. In either product, the lubricating body is generally formed using a molding process.Prior pending patent application, Ser. No. 12/629,249, entitled “Razor Cartridge Components With Indicia,” filed Dec. 2, 2009, and assigned to the Assignee hereof, describes the formation of indicia on razor cartridge components where indicia for instance, may be recessed via injection molding a design into a lube ring. In order to change from one indicia design to another as may be desired with a launch of a new product and/or for marketing reasons, a previous mold of the injection molding process may likely not be useful, and as such, new indicia designs may generally require a new mold or a change in the molds which may typically be very costly and time-consuming. In addition, while this prior art patent application describes indicia formed using alternative methods (e.g., printing with ink) which are capable of providing an aesthetic benefit, indicia formed in this fashion were by and large not described as improving shaving attributes (e.g., comfort, closeness, safety) or other benefit (e.g., increased lubrication).Thus, there is a need to provide a unique razor and method of manufacturing razor components suitable for both male and female razors enabling improved shaving attributes (e.g., comfort, closeness, safety) while also affording a consumer to be beneficially pleased and informed when choosing and using the razor products.In accordance with the present invention, a novel razor cartridge includes at least one erodible label disposed onto at least one exterior surface of at least one razor cartridge component using label transfer technology such as heat transfer processes, screen printing, roll coating, flexographic, or rotogravure, or any combination thereof, where the composition of the label is made of from about 10% to about 100% by weight of composition of one or more water-soluble polymers. The at least one erodible label provides at least one functional benefit, at least one an aesthetic benefit, at least one cue, at least one indicia, or any combination thereof.The erodible label may be made of polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyurethane, polyacrylate, polyureas, polyalkylene glycols, cellulose based polymers, or any combination thereof. Additionally, the erodible label may include scents, thermo-chromic pigments, lipids, waxes, moisturizing agents, exfoliating agents, inorganic salts, holographic inks, marbleized inks, hair growth retardants or inhibitors, or any combination thereof.The erodible label desirably wears away completely from the exterior surface of the at least one razor cartridge component after about 2 to about 10 wet shaves, where a shave is about 200 strokes to about 250 strokes.In another aspect of the present invention, the thickness of said erodible label is reduced by about 10% to about 75% after each shave.Thus, generally the erodible label of the present invention is not permanent after a curing step in the label transfer technology.The erodible label may include a plurality of erodible labels or layers, each of which may have a different composition.The razor cartridge component includes a portion of at least one of the following: a lubricating body, a cap, a housing, a frame, a clip, a guard, a razor blade, a cartridge connecting structure, or any combination thereof.The present invention is also directed to a razor cartridge including at least one erodible label disposed in a razor cartridge in place of a lubricating body (e.g., lube ring or lube strip) wherein the erodible label is applied via a label transfer technology.The present invention is also directed to a method of making a razor cartridge including applying at least one erodible label onto at least one exterior surface of at least one component of the razor cartridge via at least one type of label transfer process wherein the at least one razor cartridge component includes a portion of at least one of the following: a lubricating body, a guard, a cap, a housing, a frame, a clip, a razor blade, a cartridge connecting structure, or any combination thereof.Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, and from the claims.In a major aspect, the invention relates to a novel razor product having a razor cartridge which includes at least one erodible label disposed on an exterior surface of a substrate which may desirably be a razor cartridge component, such as but not limited to, a lubricating body or a frame. The label is formed in a novel modification of label transfer technologies such as heat transfer processes, silk screen processes, rolling coating processes, flexographic or rotogravure, or any other labeling processes comprising ink-base or combinations thereof, where the ink for these processes is comprised substantially of water-soluble polymers.In the present invention, certain germane terms are defined as follows:Razor cartridge components include the lubricating body, the guard, the cap, the housing, the frame, the clip, the razor blade, the cartridge connecting structure, or any combination thereof as contemplated in the present invention. The guard is typically disposed in the area in front of the blades, oftentimes including one or more flexible elastomeric elements, while the cap area is generally the area behind the blades, oftentimes made of a smooth elastomeric material and/or inclusive of a lubrastrip. The frame may generally indicate a plastic area of the cartridge that the lube ring may be disposed onto and may surround the blades, while the housing may generally signify the plastic structure securing the blades prior to their placement in the frame. The clips are generally metallic pieces typically placed on the ends of the razor blades for securing the blades together in the housing. The cartridge connecting structure is an intermediate structure connecting the razor cartridge with a razor handle.A “lubricating body” in the present invention is one of the razor cartridge components listed above and may include, but is not limited to, a solid shaving aid material in the form of a lubricating strip (oftentimes referred to as a “lubrastrip”), a soap or gel (e.g., wings with gel bars or soap wings), a lubrication ring (oftentimes referred to as a “lube ring”), a foam embedded with a shaving aid material or any other lubricious composition or formulation, or any combination thereof.Any desired formulation may be used for the shaving aid material. Desirably, the shaving aid material has sufficient wear resistance so that the lubricating body lasts for about the intended life of the cartridge. However, the shaving aid material may also be exhausted before it is necessary to replace the cartridge.In the present invention, as will be described in more detail below, the erodible label disposed on a lubricating body or other razor cartridge component may include an added fragrance by placement of one or more drops of fragrance or scented oil, beads or creme.In some instances (e.g., with gel bars or soap wings), the shaving aid material used may include soap (e.g., poured or extruded soap). Such soap-based compositions may be modified to increase their hardness, wear resistance, lubricity and/or skin moisturizing and conditioning properties. For lubricating strips (lubrastrips), which are generally extruded, the shaving aid material desirably comprises a polymeric material, generally a lubricious water-soluble polymer, such as polyethylene oxide, which leaches out of the strip during shaving to enhance shave comfort and optionally a water-insoluble polymer, typically polystyrene. Adding a polycaprolactone material may improve the fabrication of the shaving aid strip, provide smoother strip surfaces and permit the inclusion of greater amounts of water-soluble polymer in the strip to cause a release of more shaving aid during use. For lubrication rings (lube rings) which are generally injection molded, the shaving aid material generally comprises a similar composition of polymeric material as described above for lubricating strips.The present invention also contemplates lubricating bodies disposed on any other razor cartridge component or portion thereof (e.g., where shaving aid material or any lubricant material or other formulation is coated or disposed on an exterior surface of the razor component).The erodible label of the present invention has a label composition which is comprised of polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyurethane, polyacrylate, polyureas, polyalkylene glycols, cellulose based polymers, or any combination thereof. The erodible label may also further comprise scents, thermo-chromic pigments, lipids, waxes, moisturizing agents, exfoliating agents, inorganic salts, holographic inks, marbleized inks, hair growth retardants or inhibitors, or any combination thereof.Generally, a desirably aspect of the erodible label of the present invention is that the label is predominantly comprised of about 10% to about 100% by weight of composition of one or more water soluble polymers.A “functional benefit” of the erodible label of the present invention pertains to having an advantage communicated to or obtained by a user (or prospective user or consumer) before, during or after the operation or use of the razor product (e.g., while shaving) involving, or concerned with the functionality or usage of the product. This functional benefit may be communicated to a user at the point of purchase (e.g., before use or when choosing a product). For instance, a user may determine that a product has a functional benefit based on the label on the razor product in a razor package displayed on a store shelf. The functional benefit may be obtained by the user during use as well. For instance, the functional benefit desirably may include a faster leaching or wear time or an increased release of lubricant or having a scent released from indicia disposed on an exterior surface of a lubricating body or other component of a razor cartridge.“Leaching” as used herein may be generally defined as the release of lubricant or soluble constituents from a lubricating body. In addition to the lubricating bodies described above (e.g., in the case of porous lubricating rings or strips made from a matrix of polyethylene oxide, oftentimes referred to as “polyox” or “PEO” and polystyrene, the leaching of a lubricating ring or strip may signify the dissolving out or the release of constituents such as the PEO or in the case of an impregnated foam or sponge type of lubricating body, the leaching or release of lubricant generally occurs from the pores of the impregnated foam or sponge), the label of the present invention may be thought of as an additional lubricating body or providing the benefits of a lubricating body in terms of release of lubricant or soluble constituents (e.g., a wearing away) in terms of improved shaving attributes such as comfort and glide and moisturization.The erodible label may also wear by a certain amount per wet shave. The amount of wear may range anywhere from about 10% to about 75% per wet shave. The wearing away may be measured by any and all label dimensions, though the reduction in a thickness dimension will be described herein. Each wet shave may desirably range, on average, from about 200 to about 250 strokes. The erodible label may desirably wear off completely from the exterior surface of the razor cartridge component after about 2 shaves to about 10 shaves. Naturally, the number of shaves or the percentage wear may vary as a result of the ingredients in the label composition, and other user variable factors, such as amount of force on the skin, days between shaves, hair type, and the surface area to be shaved. A wet shave generally signifies a shave where water and/or a shave preparation will be used.Depending on the composition of the label, another benefit of having an erodible label of the present invention may arise where the erodible label of the present invention operationally provides hair improvements such as but not limited to, hair minimization or hair reduction. Additionally, the label may serve to provide a user with the functional benefit of providing skin moisturization, acne-reduction or any other skin improvements during and/or after use.An “aesthetic benefit” of the erodible label of the present invention pertains generally to an advantage communicated to or obtained by a user (or prospective user) before, during, or after, operation or use of the razor product involving, or concerned with pure emotion and sensation as opposed to pure intellectuality and may include one or more aspects of beauty. In many instances, this aesthetic benefit may be a pleasing sensation or emotion provided to a user (e.g., a feeling or opinion that a product is appealing or attractive, that it may be easy or fun to use, that it may be safe for sensitive skin, etc.) by the product at the point of purchase (e.g., before use). However, an aesthetic benefit may be obtained by the user during use as well. For instance, the aesthetic benefit of a pleasing scent or other sensation may be realized as the user is operating the razor. Additionally, the label may serve to provide a user with the aesthetic benefit of skin that looks good or appears moist or otherwise improved after such use.The aesthetic or functional benefits described herein may be achieved in the present invention without requiring a new routine, a new way of thinking, or extra work for the consumer.Furthermore, the label may also beneficially minimize any confusion or guesswork about a razor's attributes or may inspire the user to be more attentive to the characteristics of the razor and how the razor feels against their skin during use.In the present invention, the erodible label may serve as a “cue” desirably providing a hint, signal or indication or identification of an experience, or may act as an “indicium,” (or “indicia” in its plural form), signifying one or more discriminating marks, signs, tokens, indications, or appearances on a razor cartridge component (e.g., a lubricating body).The label of the present invention desirably provides and/or conveys one or more “functional” benefits and/or one or more “aesthetic” benefit(s) to a consumer. In many instances, the label may correspond to characteristics or benefits of the razor cartridge components and thus may assist in communicating these characteristics or benefits to a consumer or user.Several examples of types of labels offering functional and aesthetic benefits, cues or indicia, disposed onto a portion of the exterior surface of a razor cartridge component, such as, but not limited to, a lubricating body of a razor cartridge, are described below in accordance with the present invention.Generally, labels of the present invention may include, but are not limited to, one or more graphic, pattern, design, text, fragrance, or any combination thereof. Graphics may include pictures (e.g., a man's or woman's face), logos, images, shapes, or charts or any combination thereof. An indicium may generally be anything, such as for example, a water droplet, a flower, a bubble, or a sparkle. A group of water droplets or other indicia may form a pattern or design. A pattern may include one or more decorative or ornamental markings (e.g., water droplets, flowers, bubbles, sparkles, etc.) where such markings may be repeated or combined with other patterns. Designs may include sketches or artworks of flowers, vines, lace, or any other desirable schemes or combinations thereof. Text may include any writings with letters, numbers, or symbols or any combination thereof. The labels of the present invention are not intended to cover known prior art color-changes on lubricating strips or other lubricating bodies. The labels of the present invention may also be geared to a particular demographic, age group, (e.g., young men or teenage or pre-teen girls) or country and could also include, for instance, a hologram for showing a three dimensional image or the label of the present invention may include a fragrance or scent.Label transfer technologies as used herein signifies the process involved to transfer a label onto a substrate. In some cases, the transfer will occur with the use of a carrier film carrying the label prior to its transfer to the substrate. After transfer of the label to the substrate, the carrier film is removed. In other processes, the label transfer to the substrate may occur without the use of a carrier film; this is oftentimes referred to as a direct transfer. Some technologies may allow for transfer of the label either with or without a carrier film.Curing is a step used in any of types of label transfer technology processes and may occur prior to or after the transfer of the label. As used in the present invention, it generally signifies the process of toughening or hardening the label formulation, generally a polymer based formulation, such as those found in inks by cross-linking the polymer molecule chains. The curing process in the present invention may be achieved by heat, UV (ultra violet) radiation, or EB (electron beam) radiation, or any combination thereof. As it is known in the art, during the process of curing, any extraneous solvents not required in the cross-linking process are generally removed. In the prior art, after curing, the transferred label becomes generally permanently disposed on the substrate.One known type of label transfer technology is a heat transfer label process, a process where inks are printed onto a carrier film (made of polyethylene oxide or a bi-axially oriented polypropylene or BOPP) and subsequently transferred directly to a desired surface by applying pressure P (at about 20 to about 40 psi) and heat H (at temperatures ranging from 100 to 320 degrees Celsius) during a short interval of time T (times that vary between less than about 0.1 second to about 1 second).In addition to heat transfer label technology, screen printing and roll coating technologies are other types of label transfer technologies that may be used as a method to transfer one or more labels onto an exterior surface of a substrate in the present invention. Screen printing involves inks which are generally forced through a mesh and applied onto a desired surface. Roll coating consists of the application of a thin film onto a desired surface by rolling or turning a roll wetted with the ink. In general, screen printing and roll coating technologies do not require heat to be applied and these technologies may or may not require a carrier film to transfer the ink to a substrate. If a carrier film is not required, oftentimes this is referred to as a direct transfer.Flexographic type label transfer processes generally involve a system of printing on a rotary press covered by a flexible relief plate, employing solvent or water-based ink, used especially for printing on plastic, paper, or cardboard.Rotogravure generally involves printing by an intaglio printing process in which letters and pictures are transferred from an etched copper cylinder to a web of paper, plastic, or similar material in a rotary press. Generally, flexographic type and rotogravure label transfer processes may require a carrier film and heat to transfer the label to a substrate. Other label transfer processes if known in the art are also contemplated in the present invention.Labels of the prior art are generally made of ink which is substantially non-water soluble and includes materials such as polyesters, polyurethanes, epoxies, or polyacrylates. or any combination thereof. In addition, the labels thus produced from the types of label transfer technologies described above are generally permanent after curing or drying. In fact, the concept of producing a temporary label is generally not desired in the prior art as once the label (e.g., decoration, etc.) is applied it is intended to be preserved or maintained. For instance, silk-screen processes are commonly used to place a design type label on T-shirts where the design label is intended to be preserved even after repeated washing and wearing of the T-shirt.In one prior art reference, U.S. Pat. No. 3,891,581, entitled Water Dilutable Transfer Ink Compositions which issued on Jun. 24, 1975, a water-dilutable ink for use with heat transfer processes is described for textile fabrics and the like. While providing ease of use and ease of cleaning of equipment, this prior art reference describes a permanent label, enduring on the fabric over time. Furthermore, the polymers that make up the ink composition of this prior art reference are not actually transferred onto the substrate to be labeled, but rather it is the pigment of the ink which is transferred via a process called sublimation which allows the label to endure on the fabric over time even if washed.The types of labels found in the prior art are generally in direct contrast to the novel erodible label disposed on razor cartridge components of the present invention, which will be described in more detail below.Thus, the present invention is directed to a novel label transfer process (e.g., heat transfer labeling) where the ink of the label is substantially a water-soluble polymer.Additionally, the present invention is directed to a novel label formed using the novel label transfer process wherein the label formed is erodible (e.g., not permanent), wears away with use (e.g., number of shaves), or dissolves in water.Still further, the present invention is directed to the benefits of the label formed by the novel label transfer process. These benefits can be categorized into functional benefits and aesthetic benefits as defined herein and as described in detail in prior pending patent application, Ser. No. 12/629,249, entitled “Razor Cartridge Components With Indicia,” filed Dec. 2, 2009, assigned to the Assignee hereof.Referring now to the flow diagram of , a novel label transfer process (e.g., heat transfer labeling) is described where the composition of the label is substantially comprised of a water-soluble polymer, such as PEO in accordance with the present invention.At step a pre-transfer label ′ is shown affixed to a bottom surface of a carrier sheet . Carrier sheet  may be in a roll format (not shown). The process of transferring pre-transfer label  to substrate , forming a post-transfer or final label  includes, as shown at step applying heat H and pressure P to the upper surface of the carrier sheet , as shown in  for a time T, where heat, pressure and time parameters and conditions are desirably similar to those described above with regard to heat transfer label processes. After the requisite heat H, pressure P and time T conditions have been satisfied, the carrier sheet  will then be removed (e.g., desirably automatically rolled off, but also may be manually removed) from the pre-transfer label ′ and post-transfer or final label  will be left on to the exterior surface of substrate  as shown at step A curing step C of label  may occur after it is disposed on the substrate  as shown in step Alternatively, the curing step C of the label  may have occurred prior to step or at the point of forming the label ′ onto carrier sheet  (not shown).While a heat transfer process is described herein, the label  may be disposed onto the substrate using any other label transfer processes which may involve a pressure P, with or without heat H, such as silk screen processes or roll coating processes and with or without a carrier film as also described above, or any other feasible transfer process, or any combinations thereof.Once the label  has been applied to the substrate , the carrier sheet  may thereafter desirably be thrown away.Even after heat, pressure and curing, label  will desirably not be permanent as will be described below.In , a component  is shown including the label  of  disposed on an exterior surface of substrate  in accordance with the present invention.Label  is desirably substantially comprised of one or more water soluble polymers. It may be desirable that label  be substantially comprised of one type of water soluble polymer, such as polyethylene oxide (PEO). Label  of the present invention will generally include from about 10% to about 100% by weight of composition of a water soluble polymer.The present invention contemplates that label  may also be comprised of polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyurethane, polyacrylate, polyureas, polyalkylene glycols, cellulose based polymers, or any combination thereof. Label  may also further include scents, thermo-chromic pigments, lipids, waxes, moisturizing agents, exfoliating agents, inorganic salts, holographic inks, marbleized inks, hair growth retardants or inhibitors, or any combination thereof. In some instances, the label may comprise ingredients that are found in typical shaving aid materials.Desirably, substrate  may be at least a portion of one or more razor cartridge components which may generally include at least one of the following: a lubricating body, a cap, housing, a frame, a clip, a guard, a razor blade, a cartridge connecting structure, or any combination thereof. For instance, substrate  may be a lubricating body such as a lubrication ring (e.g., lube ring) or a lubricating strip (e.g., lube strip) or a hard plastic substrate (e.g., frame), or any combination thereof.The exterior surface of the substrate  and the substrate  may be generally be made of a hard plastic substrate, a lubrication formulation, a metal, a rubber, a wood, a non-woven material, bamboo, or any combination thereof. In the present invention, the exterior surface and the substrate may or may not be made of the same material.A top view of  is shown in , where label  is depicted covering a substantial portion of the exterior surface of substrate  but not the entirety of the exterior surface of substrate  in accordance with one aspect of the present invention. It should be noted however that label  may cover the entire exterior surface of substrate  or almost the entire exterior surface of substrate  (as shown in ) in accordance with another aspect of the present invention and thus, label  may have substantially equivalent surface area as the substrate  it is disposed on.The present invention is also directed to the novel label formed using the novel label transfer process of  wherein the formed label is erodible (e.g., not permanent), wears away with wet shaving use, or dissolves in water. Generally, label  may desirably include ingredients typically found in lube rings and/or lubrastrips of traditional razor cartridges. For instance, a lube ring is typically made of a blend of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polystyrene, which when wetted during shaving, are capable of providing lubrication and moisturization to a user. As it is known in the art, the lube ring also typically wears away from one shave to the next.Since label  of the present invention is made of polyethylene oxide (PEO) or in some cases, almost exclusively of PEO, label  thus includes a similar chemistry as the lube ring (e.g., based on having one of the components of the lube ring blend—the PEO) and desirably exhibits similar properties when wetted during shaving. Thus, the label  itself will also desirably provide added lubrication and moisturization to a user's skin, and much like current lube rings and lube strips, label  of the present invention may desirably be an erodible label, wearing away during wet shaving since label  will desirably dissolve when in contact with water in a similar fashion as the PEO from the lube ring on a cartridge does.However, label  of the present invention may desirably wear away at a faster rate (e.g., increased leaching per shave) than current lube rings or lube strips because of the greater amount of water-soluble polymer or in this particular embodiment, a greater amount of PEO. Thus, a label may wear, shave to shave, anywhere from about 10% to about 75% from its initial size (e.g., thickness or height).Additionally, unlike current lube rings and lube strips, it is desirable that label  may, to a large extent or substantially completely erode or wear away after a certain number of shaves, leaving the exterior surface of the substrate  exposed. Therefore, the label may, if desired, be used as a cue or indicator of consumption signifying it is almost time or time to change the cartridge.Depending on the type of label desired, the erodible label of the present invention may have relatively varying dimensions and locations on the exterior surface of a razor cartridge component.The width of one erodible label may desirably range from about 0.5 mm to about 45 mm, the length may desirably range from about 0.5 mm to about 11 mm, and the height may desirably range from about 0.001 mm to about 5.00 mm, more desirably ranging up to about 3.00 mm, and most desirably up to about 1.00 mm, above the exterior surface of the razor cartridge component. Moreover, by varying the location, thickness, and other characteristics of the label, the amount and lubrication and leach rate may also likely vary.In addition to providing an increased leach rate, the label of the present invention may also provide functional and aesthetic benefits. For instance, the label may be decorative, may provide a cue or indicia. Such a label is shown in  where a razor cartridge  is depicted having a label  including a design comprising multiple individual water droplets arranged on an exterior surface of substrate . Substrate  may desirably be a lube ring. Label  is placed on substrate  via label transfer technology (e.g., heat transfer label) desirably simultaneously covering the desired portions of the exterior surface of lube ring  in accordance with the present invention.The water droplets of the water droplets label  may serve as indicia letting a user know that the lube ring will function to provide lubrication and/or moisture. The water droplets will during shaving over time and may wear away completely after several shaves.The functional benefit of the water droplet label  (e.g., moisturization or lubriciousness) may be communicated to the user at that point in time and with that, a functional benefit may also be communicated to the user even before use.Not only do water droplets on lube ring  provide functional benefits to the user, they may also communicate several aesthetic benefits to the user. The water droplet pattern in razor cartridge  may communicate a pleasing sensation to the user before, during or after use of the razor. Label  for instance, may provide a user the notion that the razor product is safe to use for sensitive skin or that the razor is otherwise appealing. During use, the label  may emit a pleasant scent or fragrance to the user providing another aesthetic benefit if the formulation includes a fragrance.However, a significant advantage of using label transfer technologies for providing an erodible label on any razor cartridge component (e.g., the lube ring) is the ease with which one may change the label or the design of the label as desired. If a design change is desired, there is no need for costly and time-consuming injection mold changes or other different or new machinery such as cavities and cores for molds which are often used for components such as lube rings and gel bars. The ability to change a label's design is a simple matter of changing the screens or plates that are used in the printing processes. This allows the submission of new rolls of labels with new artwork. This change is much simpler and less time consuming than producing, at the outset, new or changed molds or new machinery. Further, any number and any type of label may be implemented in the present invention, some of which will be described below.depicts an alternate embodiment of the present invention showing a razor cartridge including an erodible label  disposed on a frame  of the razor cartridge Erodible label  is depicted as including individual flowers Frame  may desirably be made of a hard or rigid plastic material such as polypropylene, polystyrene, high impact polystyrene, poly (phenylene oxide), polyoxymethylene, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene polymer (ABS), or any combination thereof. In addition to a functional (e.g., lubriciousness) benefit, flowers of label  may provide an indicia that the cartridge will exude a pleasant fragrance. Aesthetic benefits conveyed by the erodible label  to a user may include a desirable, pleasant feeling of flowers. For instance, flowers look comforting, natural, sensitive, and design  has appealing shapes which exude a fresh, spring-like feeling. Additionally, if a fragrance or moisturization ingredients are provided within the label , thereby giving off a nice scent to the user, both aesthetic and functional benefits of label , during shaving, may be realized.depicts an alternate embodiment of the present invention showing a razor cartridge including an erodible label  disposed on a lube ring  of the razor cartridge and an erodible label ′ disposed on the outer surface of the metal clips. Erodible label  forms a floral or vine-like pattern desirably using marbleized inks. Both labels may be formed using label transfer technology such as heat transfer processes either desirably simultaneously in one process or in two serial processes (e.g., first the label on the clips and then the label on the lube ring).Aesthetic benefits conveyed by the erodible label  to a user may include a desirable, pleasant feeling of flowers. For instance, flowers look comforting, natural, sensitive, and design  has appealing shapes which exude a fresh, spring-like feeling. Label  may also include gold, silver, or other colors which may generally be deemed luxurious and may convey a high-end feeling and be marketed for a particular demographic. Additionally, if a fragrance or moisturizing ingredients are provided within the label, thereby giving off a nice scent to the user, both aesthetic and functional benefits of label , during shaving, may be realized.By being shiny, reflective and/or sparkly, erodible label ′ may afford the user with aesthetic (e.g., pleasing) benefits indicating that the cartridge is clean and new.These benefits may be communicated to a user at the retail store if the labels are visible in the razor package displayed on the store shelf or during the first or subsequent uses at home.In addition to lubricating bodies and clips, the novel aspects of the present invention of may be desirably disposed on other razor cartridge components similarly, such as portions of at least one of the following other razor cartridge components, such as a guard, a cap, a housing, a razor blade, a cartridge connecting structure, or any combination thereof.depicts a razor cartridge  showing erodible label  incorporated onto an exterior surface  of a foam  in accordance with the present invention. Foam  may be embedded with lubricating fluid (not shown) which leaches from pores and foam  may, as shown, surround the circumference of razor blades  entirely. Label  is depicted as water droplets that may be desirably disposed on the exterior surface  with the label transfer technologies described herein. Label  may provide both aesthetic (e.g., pleasing) and functional benefits when these benefits are communicated to a user based on the erodible label  being visible on the razor product in a razor package displayed on a store shelf and after repeated uses at home. Additionally, the erodible label  as it leaches lubricant during shaving may serve to provide a user with the functional benefit of providing skin moisturization or other skin improvements during and/or after use.depicts a razor cartridge  showing erodible label disposed onto an exterior surface of a soap wing or gel bar  in accordance with the present invention via at least one type of label transfer technology. Label is depicted as text as for instance including the word VENUS, (e.g., representing Venus®, a trade name). Erodible label is generally depicted as patterns of bubbles disposed onto exterior surfaces and of lube strip  and guard , respectively. The labels and may both provide aesthetic and functional benefits, cues or indicia. For instance, the bubbles label may provide indicia and/or aesthetic benefits to a user before or during use may include exuding an appealing, pleasant feeling of bubbles in water, a relaxing bath-time, a moisturizing, soothing experience, and/or a fresh clean feeling. Functional benefits of label on the lube strip during use may conceivably include an increased leach rate.Additionally, by providing moisturization to a user's skin, both aesthetic and functional benefits of label during and/or after shaving, are realized. The erodible label may serve as a cue as to the source of the goods or quality and/or provide an aesthetic benefit in that a pleasant feeling of a goddess is revealed while shaving.If the labels are transparent or partially transparent (e.g., a cartridge showing through a package window) in a razor package, a user is provided a visual cue of the razor cartridge in its package on display in a store. This scenario, providing visibility to a consumer  of the labels on razor product  displayed on a store shelf  at a poignant decision moment (e.g., which product to purchase), is shown in  where a consumer or prospective user  is depicted in a store aisle  detecting or viewing the erodible labels such as those described herein (label , , , or ′ for instance) disposed on the razor product  but observable from the interior of the packaging . The erodible labels, having provided aesthetic and/or functional benefits, cues or indicia to consumer , may conceivably offer the extra impetus for consumer  to decide to purchase product  rather than deciding to purchase a different product  (e.g., competitor's product) also displayed on (or proximal to) the shelf  which do not have erodible labels. Moreover, such visible labels also provide a beneficial means of debuting and conveying new features or characteristics on new razor products to the user by a razor manufacturer.depicts a razor or razor product  where razor cartridge  of  is operatively coupled to a top portion or cartridge connecting structure of a razor handle . Razor  of the present invention is contemplated as being any type and as such, may be a male, female, disposable or permanent (e.g., system) type razor product.As a further extension to the present invention, an alternate embodiment is shown in  where the label transfer technology may be utilized to form an erodible label which may be utilized as a substitute for an entire lubricating body of a razor cartridge rather than, as in , disposed only on an exterior surface of a lubricating body (e.g., lube ring). This may be accomplished by the same label transfer processes mentioned herein utilizing. In , a side view of cartridge  is depicted showing an erodible label  disposed onto an exterior surface of a frame or housing  (e.g., the substrate) to form the lubricating body. The thickness of erodible label  may desirably range up to 5.00 mm being desirably formed using a heat transfer label process where the “ink” of the label comprises a composition from about 10% to about 100% by weight of composition of one or more water soluble polymers. By transferring a very thick erodible label onto the frame or housing the label  desirably may take the place of or form the lube ring of the razor cartridge . It follows that the composition of the erodible label  may vary according to its desired wear.depicts a label  disposed on a substrate  as finally formed at step in  where the substrate  may desirably be a lube ring of a razor cartridge (such as lube ring  of ) and the label  may be comprised of any water soluble polymer formulation described herein.  depicts a flow diagram, where the label  on the lube ring will desirably wear away or erode after multiple wet shaves.The present invention contemplates that the number of shaves that occur for the label to wear away completely may range anywhere from about 2 shaves to about 10 shaves on average, each about 200 to about 250 strokes and in some cases more or less, where each shave is a wet shave or performed with water and/or other shave preparation.For simplification, S, S, and S of  are intended to signify a 1Shave , a 2Shave, and a 3Shave, respectively, with each wet shave S, S, and S desirably ranging, on average, from about 200 to about 250 strokes (or more or less).Starting at step of , the thickness of the label  may initially be in the range of from about 0.001 mm to about 5.00 mm, and preferably at about 0.10 mm to about 0.30 mm.At step which occurs after S, (e.g., about 200 strokes to about 250 strokes), it can be seen that the thickness of label  may be reduced from that at step by about 10% to about 75%.At step which occurs after S, (e.g., about  strokes to about  strokes which occur subsequent to and in addition to S's strokes), it can be seen that the thickness of label  may be reduced from that at step by about 10% to about 75%.At step which occurs after S, (e.g., about 200 strokes to about 250 strokes which occur subsequent to and in addition to S and S' s strokes), the thickness of label  may be substantially reduced to zero.Though only 3 consecutive shaves are depicted in the flow diagram of , the present invention also contemplates any number of shaves (typically up to about 10 shaves or about 2000 to about 2500 strokes) in which the erodible label may wear away completely. The composition of the erodible label plays a big role in the leach rate of the label. Generally, with more PEO present in the label composition, the label leach rate increases and thus the label itself may wear at a faster rate. The presence of other polymers with a high solving rate in water, such as poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA), may also increase the leaching and thus, the wearing away of the label.It is further contemplated in the present invention that the erodible label may wear away, but not completely before the cartridge is disposed of. At step of , for instance, the thickness of label may be from about 0.01 mm to about 0.05 mm.In general, after the label  wears away completely, the substrate  (e.g., lube ring) or its exterior surface will be exposed. The user may still use the razor cartridge after the label  has completely eroded if the lube ring is still present and viable.Referring now to , a label  which may desirably be formed via label transfer technology such as heat transfer processes and disposed onto a substrate  is shown in accordance with another aspect of the present invention having an adhesive layer  disposed therebetween.The substrate  may be a lubrication ring or lubrastrip of PEO or PEO mixtures or may be a hard plastic such as a frame of a razor cartridge.Adhesive layer  may desirably act as an adhesive seal and is desirably comprised of water insoluble polymers such as acrylic polymers, up to about 70% by weight of composition or include other materials which will assist in adhesion and additionally, water soluble polymers similar to those described for the erodible label, up to about 70% by weight of composition. The adhesive layer may additionally comprise a resin or glue. The composition of the adhesive layer may also generally vary depending on the type of substrate it is being disposed on. For instance, if the substrate is such that substantial amounts of water soluble polymers are not sufficient to bond to the desired substrate, then the amounts of water insoluble polymers may generally increase in the adhesive layer composition. Thus, while the adhesive layer may desirably have a substantial amount of water soluble polymers, much like the erodible label itself, the adhesive layer of the present invention may desirably be of a different composition than that of the label  and while it is intended to also wear away, it may generally not wear as quickly as the label itself.The formation of label  with adhesive layer  on the substrate may desirably occur simultaneously in a label transfer process, such as a heat transfer label transfer process, as described above with regard to .In the flow diagram of , label  and adhesive layer  each have initial thicknesses and respectively.As before with , S, S, and S of  are intended to signify a 1Shave , a 2Shave, and a 3Shave, respectively, with each wet shave S, S, and S desirably ranging, on average, from about 200 to about 250 strokes (or more or less).Starting at step of , the thickness or height of label of the label  may initially be in the range of from about 0.001 mm to about 5.00 mm, and preferably at about 0.50 mm while the thickness of the adhesive layer  may range from about 0.001 mm to about 0.10 mm and preferably from about 0.025 mm to about 0.040 mm. Generally, the adhesive layer may desirably not be as thick as the label itself.Referring now to  at step which occurs after S, (e.g., about 200 strokes to about 250 strokes), it can be seen that the thickness of label  may be reduced from that at step by about 10% to about 75% while the thickness of adhesive layer  desirably remains the same.Generally, because the adhesive layer is beneath the label, it will not wear until the label has worn away or eroded completely. Additionally, the thicknesses of label  and adhesive layer are about the same after a certain number of shaves as for instance depicted herein at stepAt step which occurs after S, (e.g., about 200 strokes to about 250 strokes which occur subsequent to and in addition to S's strokes), it can be seen that the thickness of label  may be substantially reduced from that at step by about 10% to about 75% or as shown in , substantially reduced to zero, exposing the exterior surface of the ′ adhesive layer  whose thickness will desirably remain the same as the initial thickness.At step which occurs after S, (e.g., about 200 strokes to about 250 strokes which occur subsequent to and in addition to S and S's number of strokes), the thickness of adhesive layer  may be reduced from that at step by about 10% to about 75% or as shown, substantially reduced to zero.Though only 3 consecutive shaves are depicted in the flow diagram of , the present invention contemplates any number of shaves (potentially up to about 10 shaves or up to about 2000 to about 2500 strokes) in which the erodible label and adhesive layer to both wear away completely. The composition of the erodible label and adhesive layer each plays a big role in the leach rate of the label. Generally, with more PEO present in the label or adhesive layer composition, the leach rate increases and thus the label and adhesive layer may thus each wear at a faster rate.Referring now to , a label  which may desirably be formed via label transfer technology such as heat transfer processes and disposed onto a substrate  is shown in accordance with another aspect of the present invention having an adhesive layer  disposed therebetween.Label  however may itself desirably be comprised of one or more labels layered on top of each other or covering one another (whether partially or fully) in which desirably are both labels erodible in accordance with the present invention.For instance, as shown in , label  is comprised of two erodible labels or thought of as two label layers, an upper label layer ′ and a lower label layer ″ where the label layers ′ and ″ may have the same or different composition. For instance, erodible label layers ′ and ″ may be comprised of PEO in varying amounts. In addition, the leach rates may be different for each label layer depending on each label layer's composition oftentimes determined by the amount of PEO or any other water soluble polymer. Additionally, the erodible labels or label layers may be comprised of different designs, provide different cues or indicia, be of different colors, such that when the upper layer is worn away, the lower layer revealed is of a different color or design.Though not shown, more than two erodible label layers are also contemplated in the present invention. Furthermore, the upper label layer ′ may not cover the entirety of the lower label layer ″ in the present invention (not shown).The substrate  may be a lubrication ring or lubrastrip of PEO or PEO mixtures or may be a hard plastic such as a frame or clip or other component of a razor cartridge. Adhesive layer  may desirably act as an adhesive seal and is desirably comprised of water insoluble polymers (e.g., acrylic polymers) up to about 70% by weight of composition or other materials which will assist in adhesion and also, water soluble polymers such as those described for the erodible label of up to about 70% by weight of composition. The adhesive layer may additionally comprise a resin or glue.The composition of the adhesive layer may also generally vary depending on the type of substrate it is being disposed on. For instance, if the substrate is such that substantial amounts of water soluble polymers are not sufficient to bond to the desired substrate, then the amounts of water insoluble polymers may generally increase in the adhesive layer composition. Thus, while the adhesive layer  may desirably have a substantial amount of water soluble polymers, much like the label itself, the adhesive layer of the present invention may desirably be of a different composition than that of the label  and while it is intended to also wear away, it may generally not wear as quickly as the label itself.The formation of label  including layers ′ and ″ with adhesive layer  may desirably be formed at the same time in one label transfer process as described above with regard to .In the flow diagram of , label  and adhesive layer  each have initial thicknesses and respectively. Thickness  encompasses the thicknesses ′of upper label ′ and lower label ″.As before with , S, S, and S of  are intended to signify a 1Shave , a 2Shave, and a 3Shave, respectively, with each wet shave S, S, and S desirably ranging, on average, from about 200 to about 250 strokes (or more or less).Starting at step of , the thickness ′of the label  may initially be in the range of from about 0.001 mm to about 5.00 mm, and preferably be about 0.25 mm while the thickness ″of the lower label may range from about 0.001 mm to about 5.00 mm and preferably be about 0.50 mm and the thickness of the adhesive layer  may range from about 0.001 mm to about 0.10 mm and preferably be about 0.025 mm to about 0.040 mm. Generally, the lower label ″ and adhesive layer  may desirably not be as thick as the upper label ′.Referring now to FIG. 's step which occurs after S, (e.g., after about 200 strokes to about 250 strokes), it can be seen that the thickness ′a of upper label ′ may be reduced from that at step as shown in , substantially to zero, exposing the exterior surface ′of the lower label ″. Though not depicted, the upper label ′ at this step may have been reduced by less than about 100% (e.g., anywhere from about 10% to about 75% of any dimension, e.g., thickness).Thus far, the thicknesses ″and desirably shall remain the same. Generally, because these layers are beneath the upper label, they will not wear until the upper label has worn away or eroded completely. Thus, at step the substrate  may desirably include an adhesive layer  and a label layer ″ disposed on its exterior surfaceContinuing on to step which occurs after S, (e.g., after about 200 strokes to about 250 strokes which occur subsequent to and in addition to S's strokes), it can be seen that the thickness ″of lower label layer ″ may be substantially reduced from that at step by about 10% to about 75% or as shown in , substantially reduced to zero thickness, exposing the exterior surface of the ′ adhesive layer  whose thickness will desirably remain the same as its initial thickness.At step which occurs after S, (e.g., after about 200 strokes to about 250 strokes which occur subsequent to and in addition to S and S's number of strokes), the thickness of adhesive layer  may be reduced from that at step substantially reduced to zero as shown, or by about 10% to about 75%.Though only 3 consecutive shaves are depicted in the flow diagram of , the present invention contemplates any number of shaves (potentially up to about 10 shaves or up to about 2000 to about 2500 strokes on average) in which the erodible labels and adhesive layer may wear away completely. The composition of each erodible label and adhesive layer each plays a big role in the leach rate of the label. Generally, the more PEO present in the label or adhesive layer composition, the more the leach rate increases and thus the label and adhesive layer may each wear at a faster rate.Referring now to , a label  which may desirably be formed via label transfer technology such as heat transfer processes and disposed onto a substrate  is shown in accordance with another aspect of the present invention sandwiched between two adhesive layers  and , one adhesive layer  disposed on a substantial portion of the label 's upper surface  and one adhesive layer  on a substantial portion of label 's lower surface  in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the present invention. It is contemplated that the erodible label and the adhesive layers may or may not cover each other's upper and lower surfaces entirely.The adhesive layers generally comprise the same composition as the adhesive layers described above in . As before, the erodible label and the adhesive layers may have the same or different compositions. In this embodiment, it may be desirably for adhesive layer  to wear at a faster rate than adhesive layer  and/or even the erodible label . Thus, the leach rates may be different for each, depending on each composition oftentimes determined by the amount of PEO or any other water soluble polymer. Additionally, it should be noted that the adhesive layers while they may provide a functional benefit in terms of adhesion and some lubricity, they generally may not provide designs or other indicia.It may be desirable however that the erodible label and the adhesive layer be comprised of different colors, such that when the upper adhesive layer  is worn away and the erodible label  is revealed, a difference in color may be observed.The substrate  may be any razor component described herein (e.g., a lube ring or lubrastrip of PEO or PEO mixtures or a hard plastic such as a frame or clip or blade).The adhesive layers  and  may desirably act as adhesive seals and are preferably comprised of ingredients as mentioned above in conjunction with .The formation of label  with adhesive layers  and  may desirably be formed at the same time during one label transfer process as described above with regard to .In the flow diagram of , label  and adhesive layers  and  each have initial thicknesses and respectively.Shaves S, S, and S of  are intended to signify a 1Shave , a 2Shave, and a 3Shave, respectively, with each wet shave S, S, and S desirably ranging from, on average, about 200 to about 250 strokes (or more or less).Starting at step of , the thickness of the label  may initially be in the range of from about 0.001 mm to about 5.00 mm, and preferably at about 0.1 mm to about 0.30 mm while the thickness of the adhesive layers  and  may range from about 0.001 mm to about 0.10 mm and preferably be about 0.025 mm to about 0.040 mm.Referring now to FIG. 's step which occurs after S, (e.g., after about 200 strokes to about 250 strokes), it can be seen that the thickness of upper adhesive layer  may be reduced from that at step as shown in , substantially to zero (or anywhere from about 10% to about 75%, not shown), exposing the exterior or upper surface  of erodible label .Thus, at step the substrate  may have disposed on its exterior surface an adhesive layer  and an erodible label .At step which occurs after S, (e.g., after about 200 strokes to about 250 strokes which occur subsequent to and in addition to S's strokes), it can be seen that the thickness of erodible label  may be substantially reduced from about 10% to about 75% or as shown in , substantially reduced to zero thickness, exposing the exterior surface of the ′ adhesive layer  whose thickness desirably has not thus far changed.At step which occurs after S, (e.g., after about 200 strokes to about 250 strokes which occur subsequent to and in addition to S and S's number of strokes), the thickness of adhesive layer  may be reduced from that at step substantially reduced to zero as shown, or by about 10% to about 75%, exposing the exterior surface of the substrate  which may be a lube ring.The lube ring will continue to provide lubrication to the user but desirably will not wear as fast as the erodible label, nor the adhesive layer.Though only 3 consecutive shaves are depicted in the flow diagram of , the present invention contemplates any number of shaves (potentially up to about 10 shaves or up to about 2000 to about 2500 strokes on average) in which the erodible label(s) and/or adhesive layer(s) may wear away completely.Naturally, the composition of each erodible label and adhesive layer plays a big role in its respective leach rate. Generally, with more PEO or water soluble polymers present in the composition, the leach rate increases, and the wearing off occurs at a faster rate.The dimensions and values disclosed herein are not to be understood as being strictly limited to the exact numerical values recited. Instead, unless otherwise specified, each such dimension is intended to mean both the recited value and a functionally equivalent range surrounding that value. For example, a dimension disclosed as “40 mm” is intended to mean “about 40 mm.”All documents cited in the Detailed Description of the Invention are, in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference; the citation of any document is not to be construed as an admission that it is prior art with respect to the present invention.

                "The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/008,510, filed Jan. 18, 2011, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/295,783; filed Jan. 18, 2010, the entireties of which are hereby incorporated by reference.the present invention relates generally to motorized Shaving apparatus that utilize a shearing technique to cut hair bristles, and specifically to a motorized shaving apparatus that shears hairs between a rotary cutter and a fixed blade.The current methods for removing hair from the human body, by shaving, as opposed to epilation, involve two basic approaches: the razor approach, wherein a very sharp blade is pushed against the skin at an angle, thereby cutting hair; and the screen approach, wherein a thin fenestrated metal screen is moved across the skin, exposing hair though the holes and cutting them by a mechanized, typically motorized, cutting element.In the sharp razor blade approach, the energy for cutting is provided by the hand driving the razor across the skin of the user, typically by the hand of the user him/herself, and the hair is cut by the impact force applied thereon and by virtue of its stiffness. The conditions of cutting hair are a compromise between the ease of cutting a soft (or softened) hair (or hair bristle) and having the necessary counter-force against the blade's impact which can only come from the hardness of the hair bristle. Apart from being a compromise difficult to optimize daily on a variety of hair bristles, the sharpness of the blade and its angle pose a constant risk of nicks and cuts, as the blade is driven forcefully across the skin.In the screen approach of most motorized shaving apparatus, the problem of safety is mitigated since the skin and the cutting elements are separated by the screen. Moreover, the hair bristles which penetrate the screen through its holes are given a prop to be cut against; hence, the lack of a counter-force for cutting is also mitigated to some extent. However, in order to arrive at an efficient cutting condition, the hair bristle must enter a hole and be perpendicular to the skin, requirements which are not always met unless the screen is constantly moved across the skin. Still, when the hair bristle is eventually cut at the optimal angle, it cannot be cut close to the skin due to the separating screen.One cutting technique which requires minimal force for cutting hair can be effected by scissors. Scissors cut hair at the crossing point of two blades which do not have to be very sharp in order to cut the hair due to the fact that the blades contact the hair from substantially opposite directions in the plane of cutting, mutually providing each other with a counter-force for cutting. While it is impractical to use scissors for daily shaving, which requires maximal closeness of the cutting point to the skin, the scissors cutting technique was implemented in the form of rotary cutter units cutting hair against a flat and straight stationary blade. This hair cutting technique is capable of providing a very close shave since the cutting blades are positioned flush against the skin at the time of cutting. This also renders this cutting approach relatively safe from accidental cuts.However, the presently known configurations which have attempted to implement this technique have suffered, among other drawbacks, from improperly positioned driving mechanisms, which were placed outside of the shaving head, moving the rotary cutter unit by means of a direct shaft, or indirectly by means of external gears, bevel gears, worm gears, sprockets, belt and pulley mechanisms And the like. Essentially, these external driving, mechanisms suffer from loss of kinetic energy, leading to limited rotation speed of the rotary cutter unit, and therefore provide, poor shaving results. Moreover, all these external driving mechanisms lead to cumbersome designs, large size and substantial weight of the resulting shaving device since they house the drive mechanism alongside or perpendicularly to the shaving head. In addition, they require large powerful motors with or without portable power sources.For example, one rotary razor exists that comprises a casing provided with a slot, a cutting edge formed along one edge of the slot, guards projecting from the opposite side of the slot to a point immediately adjacent the cutting edge, the cutting edge and the guards being rigid with respect to the casing, and a rotary cutter within the casing arranged to co-act with such cutting edge. The rotary cutter in this rotary razor is provided with an adjustment means whereby it may be set at a point in close proximity to the first, named cutting edge but not in frictional contact therewith, such means comprising bearings within the casing. The bearings each have a pair of projecting arms and the casing is provided with a slot adjacent each arm. Set screws, project through the slots and into the arms while another arm projects from each pair of arms at right angles thereto. The set screws project through the casing and into the last named arms. This rotary razor provides a rotary cutter shaving device wherein the rotary cutter unit is pressed and held against the stationary blade in order to effect a close and effective shave. However, in this rotary razor, the drive mechanism is not part of the shaving head or hair-cutting head.A shearing tool also exists with a tapered cylindrical cutter held by bearings inside a housing. The housing is formed with a slot, wherein one of the edges of the slot constitutes a cutting edge cooperating with the cutting edges of the tapered cylindrical cutter. In this shearing tool, a shaft extends out of the hair-cutting head and the drive mechanism is not part of the hair-cutting head.Another rotary razor exists having a casing formed with a longitudinal slot, a rotary shaft, a series of filler blocks encircling the shaft, a series of razor blades engaged between the filler blocks and having their edges projecting spirally beyond the outer face of the filler blocks. Upon rotation of the shaft, the razor blades pass across the slot opening of the casing. A plate on the casing is arranged along one edge of the slot in a position to contact the cutting edge of the spirally positioned blades on the shaft. While this rotary razor provides a solution to the production of the rotary cutter unit the drive mechanism is outside the hair-cutting head.Another shaver exists comprising a tubular casing formed with a longitudinally extending slot and with comb teeth or fingers extending transversely to the slot. A rotor is locate within and extends longitudinally in the casing, and is rotatable therein. The rotor is formed with radial ridges extending helically and longitudinally of the rotor and have edge faces confronting the annular wall of the casing. The blades have their outer surfaces contacting the inner surface of the annular wall of the casing and are thereby pressed inwardly and cut hair against the comb's teeth. This shaver has a motor casing of usual construction, serving as a handle, and positioned outside of the hair-cutting head.Still another rotary safety razor exists comprising a shaving head having a rotary cutter unit (with helical blades) mounted to rotate about an axis. The head of this rotary safety razor comprises, in combination, a tubular casing adapted to contain the cutter and split along a longitudinal line so as to present a slot with two edges. One of these edges is formed along a major portion of its length with the cutting edge of a stationary straight blade while the other of these edges is formed with a comb opposite the cutting edge. This rotary safety razor addresses the issue of the mechanism by placing it outside the shaving head and transferring the rotational motion of the external motor via a shaft formed at one end with a worm engaging worm teeth on a rotatable cutter unit.Additional motorized shaving apparatus exist that utilize a screen wherein the cutting elements do not come in direct contact with the skin but rather are located behind the screen.The invention is directed to a shaving apparatus in which the drive mechanism, which may be in the form of an electric motor, is positioned within a rotary cutter, and hairs are sheared between the cutting edges of the rotary cutter and a fixed blade in a scissor-like action during operation of the inventive shaving apparatus. As a result of positioning the drive mechanism within the rotary cutter, the head of the inventive shaving apparatus achieves a very compact and efficient construction.In one embodiment, the invention can be a shaving apparatus comprising: an elongated handle having a longitudinal axis; a power source; a head coupled to a distal end of the elongated handle, the head having a working surface with a longitudinal width in al range of 40-44 mm and a transverse width in a range of 14-16 mm; the working surface comprising a fixed blade having a cutting edge; a rotary cutter having cutting edges disposed within the head, the cutting edges of the rotary cutter positioned adjacent the cutting edge of the fixed blade so that a user's hairs are sheared between the cutting edge of the fixed blade and the cutting edges of the rotary cutter when the rotary cutter is rotating and a motor operably coupled to the power and the rotary cutter to rotate the rotary cutter about an axis.In another embodiment, the invention can be a shaving apparatus comprising: an elongated handle having a longitudinal axis; a power source; a head coupled to a distal end of the elongated handle, the head having a working surface with a longitudinal width and a transverse width, the working surface comprising a fixed blade having a cutting edge; a rotary cutter having cutting edges disposed within the head, the cutting edges of the rotary cutter terminating in outer surfaces that collectively define a reference cylinder, the cutting edges, of the rotary cutter positioned adjacent the cutting edge of the fixed blade so that a user's hairs are sheared between the cutting edge of the fixed blade and the cutting edges of the rotary cutter when the rotary cutter is rotating, a motor operably coupled to the power source and the rotary cutter to rotate the rotary cutter about an axis; and Wherein a ratio of the longitudinal width of the working surface of the head to a diameter of the, reference cylinder is between 2.8 and 3.7.In yet another embodiment, the invention can be a shaving apparatus comprising: an elongated handle having a longitudinal axis; a power source; a head having a working surface and coupled to a distal end of the elongated handle; the working surface comprising a fixed blade having a cutting edge; a rotary cutter having spaced-apart cutting edges disposed within the head, each of the spaced-apart cutting edges having a bi-directional helical shape, the cutting edges of the rotary cutter positioned adjacent the cutting edge of the fixed blade so that a user's hairs are sheared between the cutting edge of the fixed blade and the cutting edges of the rotary cutter when the rotary cutter is rotating; and a motor operably coupled to the power source and the rotary cutter to rotate the rotary cutter about an axis.Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter.

Accordingly, the invention expressly should not be, limited to such exemplary embodiments illustrating some possible non-limiting combination of features that may exist, alone or in other combinations of features; the scope of the invention being defined by the claims appended hereto.As discussed hereinabove, shaving aims to achieve safe hair cutting, as close as possible to the level of the skin. In the context of human, grooming activity, shaving is performed using two basic paradigms, cutting the hair bristle by a single sharp element impacting the hair from one side (e.g, razor), which can be referred to as “scraping”, or by two cutting elements snipping the hair from two opposite sides (e.g. scissors and shaving machines), which can be referred to as “shearing,” “clipping” or “snipping.” In terms of industrial applications, these two paradigms have split early on and evolved separately.Attempts at mechanizing the razor have resulted in two basic types of motorized razors, the vibrating razor which is directed at affording a sawing motion perpendicular to the movement of the blade across the skin, and the rotating blade, directed at mechanizing and speeding-up the scraping action. Nevertheless, shaving by the scraping paradigm has always presented a peril, either from scratching and lacerating the skin by blunt and/or rough (used) blades, or from nicks and cuts from very sharp and even fresh (unused) blades.Compared to scraping (razor) shaving, using scissors for shaving (shearing) presents an entirely different set of problems to be solved. One problem associated with using scissors for close and safe facial shaving is the point of shear, namely the hair is less likely, to be snipped at the level of the skin, leaving a substantial bristle. Another problem is speed, since a hair is cut only at the crossing of the blade-pair, an event that is less frequent when compared to the frequency of hair-blade encounters in the case of the single-scraping blade (razor).Screen-based shaving machines mitigated some of the problems of shaving by shearing mainly closeness and speed. Still, the need for a narrow shaving head which can be placed or passed across the human face without obstructions posed a limit on the size of the shaving head to be narrow and slim, and the need for a powerful motor (and thus a large enough power supply unit) imposed limits to the size of the contemporary shaving machine from the other side of the range. Hence, a shaving machine having the requirements of a small and accessible shaving head and sufficiently powered motor is typically bulky.While searching for an optimal solution to all the aforementioned problems associated with a mechanized scissors action shaving (shearing) apparatus, the present inventor has now accomplished a light-weigh and compact shearing shaving apparatus which provides a fast, safe and close shave.Hence, according to some embodiments of the present, invention, the problem of an accessible shaving head is solved with a narrow and slim shaving head having the moving parts confined within the rotary cutter. Furthermore, according to some embodiments of the present invention, the compact drive mechanism, which can be in the form of an electric motor, can be powered effectively using a relatively compact power source placed in a narrow tube-like handle. Because the shaving apparatus will not have external gears, shafts or belts in some embodiments, far less energy is wasted on eccentric moving parts and friction. Put together, the provisions of the present invention solve the problem of cumbersome motorized shaving apparatus by using a shaving head as described hereinbelow, which is implemented in a shaving apparatus that has, for example, the size and shape of a contemporary non-motorized razor as described below.Referring first to  concurrently, a shaving apparatus  according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The shaving apparatus  generally comprises a handle portion  (hereinafter referred to as the “handle”) and a head portion  (hereinafter referred to as the “head”). The handle  provides the user of the shaving apparatus  with the necessary structure to comfortably and firmly grip and maneuver the shaving apparatus  in the manner necessary to shave a desired area of skin. In the exemplified embodiment, the handle  is an elongated structure that comprises a generally cylindrical portion  for gripping and a mounting member  for coupling of the head  to the handle . In one embodiment, the handle  has a length between 70 mm to 140 mm.Thee cylindrical portion  extends along the longitudinal axis A-A. In one embodiment, the cylindrical portion  of the handle  has a diameter of between 10 mm to 25 mm. The mounting member  is coupled, to a distal end  of the cylindrical portion  and extends radially away from the longitudinal axis A-A in an inclined manner. The distal end of the mounting member  is configured so that the head  can be coupled thereto. The head  can be coupled to the mounting member  in a permanent, semi-permanent, or detachable manner. For example, the head  could be integrally formed with the mounting member , thereby creating a permanent coupling. Alternatively, the head  could be coupled to the mounting member  via ultrasonic welding, thermal welding, soldering, adhesion or combinations thereof, thereby creating a semi-permanent coupling. In still other embodiments, the head  could be coupled to the mounting member  via a snap-fit connection, a mechanical interlock, an interference fit, a threaded connection, a tab/slot interlock, a latch, or combinations thereof, thereby creating a detachable coupling. Of course, other connection techniques are contemplated and are considered to be within the scope of the invention. Moreover, in certain other embodiments of the invention, the mounting member  can be less prominent or omitted all together so that the head  is directly coupled to the cylindrical portion .As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, an attempt to arrive at a minimal size and weight of a battery-powered motorized shaving apparatus may end at the size limitation of the battery which can power the motor effectively so as to deliver the required effect for the required time period. When achieving a reduction of the work-load of the motorized element and making its action more efficient, one can then reduce the overall size limitations imposed also of the power source, namely the battery or batteries. As presented hereinbelow, the shaving head according to some embodiments of the present invention is designed such that its scissors-likes shaving action can be effected by a small motor, which can therefore be powered by a correspondingly small power source, compared to presently known configurations. Hence, the shaving head design, according to embodiments of the present invention, can afford a significant reduction of power consumption, leading to a significant reduction in size of the motor assembly, leading in turn to a significant reduction in size and, weight of the entire shaving apparatus.In the exemplified embodiment, the handle  also acts as a water-tight housing for a power source  (shown in dotted lines) that powers the motor  that rotates the rotary cutter  of the head  (the details of which will be discussed in greater detail below with respect to ). Of course, in other embodiments, the power source  may be housed elsewhere in the shaving apparatus . For example, in certain alternate embodiments, the power source  may be housed entirely or at least partially within the head . The power source  can be in the form of one or more batteries as is known in the art. In the exemplified embodiment, the batteries are disposed on and extend along the longitudinal axis A-A of the handle . Of course, alternative types of power sources can be utilized to power the motor  as desired. The exact type of power source  utilized in the shaving apparatus  will depend on the power requirements of the motor  and, thus, is not to be considered limiting of the present invention unless specifically stated otherwise in the claims.The power source  could be replaceable or permanent. In embodiments in which a removable power source  is used, the power source  may be one or more batteries that could be removed from the handle  for replacement or recharging. In such an embodiment, the handle  will further comprise the necessary structure to access the chamber of the handle  in which the, power source  is located. In the exemplified embodiment, a removable cap  is provided at the proximal end  of the handle . The removable cap  can be coupled to the cylindrical portion  of the handle  via a threaded connection, a tight-fit assembly, or other connection technique that would create a fluid tight boundary so that water could not enter the chamber in which the power source  is located. In alternate embodiments, access to the internal chamber of the handle  in which the power source  is disposed can be accomplished via a hinged panel, a latch, a removable panel or any other structure as would be known to one of skill in the art.In embodiments where a permanent (or non-removable) battery is used, the handle  may further comprise an electrical port to which a power cord could be electrically coupled to recharge the power source . To prevent water or other fluids from entering the electrical port, the electrical port may be provided behind a removable access panel or be provided with a cap/plug that seals the electrical port.A switch  is provided on the handle  for manually controlling the energization of the motor . While the switch  is exemplified as a manual slide switch, the switch could be any type of manual or automatic switch as would be known by those of skill in the art. In addition to the switch , control circuitry for controlling the performance characteristics of the motor  may also be located within the chamber of the handle  as desired.As mentioned above, the head  is coupled to the distal end of the mounting member  of the handle . The head  has a generally elongated shape and extends along the longitudinal axis B-B. As discussed, in detail below, the longitudinal axis B-B of the head  also serves as the axis of rotation of the rotary cutter . In the exemplified embodiment, when the head  is coupled to the handle , the head  is substantially perpendicular to the handle . More specifically, when the head  is coupled to the handle , the longitudinal axis B-B of the head  is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis A-A of the handle . Moreover, the handle  is coupled to the center of the head  so that the shaving apparatus  has a generally T-shape.In the exemplified embodiment, the head  is fixedly coupled to the handle  through the use, of fastener elements  that extend from a tubular housing  of the head . The fastener elements  are plates that extend from a rear face  of the head  opposite the front face  of the head , wherein the front face  can be considered the working/cutting face of the head  as described below. The fastener elements  matingly engage corresponding structure on the mounting member  of the handle . Of course, the fastener elements  can take on a wide variety of structures, including pins, tangs, sockets, or other coupling or mating structures.While the head  is fixedly coupled to the handle  in the exemplified embodiment, the head  may be pivotally connected to the handle  so that the orientation of the head  can be pivoted with respect to the handle . Thought of another way, in such an arrangement, the head  can be pivoted so that the longitudinal axis B-B of the head  can be rotated relative to the longitudinal axis A-A of the handle . Such pivotal movement can be accomplished in a variety of manners. In one embodiment, the fastener elements  of the head  pivotally couples the head  to the mounting member . In another. embodiment, the mounting member  is pivotally coupled to the cylindrical portion  of the handle . Pivotally coupling the head  to the handle  enables the front face  of the head  to be pivoted to any desired position with respect to the handle  during use of the shaving apparatus , thereby allowing the user a greater degree of flexibility and the ability to shave complex contours and/or hard to reach places.The pivotal coupling of the head  to the handle  allows the head  to swivel (i.e., rock), within a limited angle range about the longitudinal axis A-A of the handle. Such pivotal rotation allows the head  to adjust its position relative to the plane of motion and the skin of a user during use of the shaving apparatus . Such pivotal motion can be limited, by mechanical means in the attachment mechanism and/or the handle  and/or the head , to a desired angle of rotation. In certain embodiments the angle of rotation may be 180 degrees, 90 degrees, 60 degrees, 30 degrees or less than 30 degrees.As mentioned above, in certain alternate embodiments, the head  will be detachably coupled to the handle . In such embodiments, the head  can be sold as a “refill” head for the handle . As discussed below with respect to , the motor is located within the rotary cutter  of the head . Moreover, as discussed above, the power source  is located within the handle . Thus, a continuous electrical connection extends, from the power source  in the handle  to the motor  in the head  in order to power the motor  during use. Therefore, in embodiments where the head  is detachably coupled to the handle , electrical interface connectors (i.e., contacts) will be provided at appropriate positions on both the handle  and the head  that come into electrical coupling with one another when the head  is coupled to the , thereby completing the electrical circuit.Referring now to  concurrently, the head  generally comprises a tubular housing , a first end cap , a second end cap , a fixed blade , the motor , the rotary cutter , a first annular bearing , and a second annular bearing . When the head is assembled (discussed below with respect to ), as shown in , the head  is a compact, elongated and generally cylindrical structure, extending along longitudinal axis B-B.The head  extends from a first end  to a second end  along the longitudinal axis B-B, thereby defining a maximum longitudinal width Wof the head . In an exemplary embodiment, the maximum longitudinal width Wof the head  is less than or equal to 60 mm. In another exemplary embodiment, the maximum longitudinal width Wof the head  is between 40 mm to 60 mm. In yet another embodiment, the maximum longitudinal width Wof the head  is between 40 mm to 55 mm. In a still further embodiment, the maximum longitudinal width Wof the head  is between 40-44. mm. The head further comprises a maximum transverse width W, extending from a lead face  of the head  to a trail face  of the head . In an exemplary embodiment, the maximum transverse width Wof the head  is less than or equal to 25 mm. in another embodiment, the maximum transverse width Wof the head  is between 10 mm. to 25 mm. In yet another embodiment, the maximum transverse width Wof the head  is between 10 mm to 20 mm. In still another embodiment, the maximum transverse width Wof the head  is between 10 mm to 16 mm. In a still further embodiment, the maximum transverse width Wof the head  is between 14 to 16 mm.In the exemplified embodiment, both the maximum longitudinal width Wof the head  and the maximum transverse width Wof the head  are measured on the front face  of the head . The front face  of the, head  is the working face of the head  in that it is the face of the head  that is put into contact with the user's skin so that the shaving apparatus  can shear hairs between the rotary cutter  and the fixed blade . In alternate embodiments, the maximum longitudinal width Wof the head  and/or the maximum transverse width Wof the head  may be dictated by other components of (or at other locations on) the head . In certain embodiments, a ratio of the longitudinal width Wof the head  to the transverse width Wof the head  is between 2.5 and 3.2, and more specifically the ratio can be between 2.7 and 3.0.The tubular housing  is an elongated hollow tubular structure extending from a first end  of the tubular housing  to a second end  of the tubular housing  along longitudinal axis B-B. The tubular housing  comprises an internal cavity  for accommodating the rotary cutter  and the motor . The internal cavity  of the tubular housing  is dimensioned so as to be capable of receiving and enclosing both the rotary cutter  and the motor  therein.The tubular housing  also comprises an elongated slot  that forms a passageway into the internal cavity  of the tubular housing . The elongated slot  allows hair bristles to enter the tubular housing  and be sheared between the rotary cutter  and the fixed blade  as discussed in greater detail with respect to A-B. In the exemplified embodiment, the elongated slot  extends the entire longitudinal length of the tubular housing  in a continuous and uninterrupted manner. However, in certain alternate embodiments, the elongated slot  may not extend the entire longitudinal length of the tubular housing  and may instead be segmented and/or discontinuous in nature.The elongated slot  is defined by a cutting edge  of the fixed blade  and an opposing edge  of the tubular housing . In the exemplified embodiment, the opposing edge  of the tubular housing is formed by a plurality of axially-spaced lingers  that collectively form a comb guard . The comb guard  is part of the tubular housing  and can be pressed against the user's skin during a cutting operation to more effectively feed the hair bristles to the rotary cutter  and fixed blade  for shearing, at the same time protecting the user from nicking or cutting the skin. In order to further achieve this purpose, the outer surfaces  of the fingers  of the comb guard  are optionally flat or rounded to facilitate the of the head  over the user's skin.In certain embodiments, the tubular housing  may also comprise an optional opening (short slot) in the rear face  of the head  for allowing removal of sheared hair bristle debris from the internal cavity . Such a feature may be especially useful in embodiments in which a bi-directional helical rotary cutter  is utilized (described in greater detail below). Finally, as can be seen in , the fastener elements  are also part of the tubular housing .Referring now to FIGS.  and A-B, the rotary, cutter  is of a hollow cylindrical configuration. The rotary cutter  comprises a cylindrical body  having an outer surface  and an inner surface . The inner surface  forms a cavity  about the longitudinal axis B-B (which is also both the central axis and rotational axis of the rotary cutter ). The cavity  Of the rotary cutter  is dimensioned so as to receive the motor  therein. When the head  is assembled, the motor  is mounted within the cavity  of the rotary cutter  (discussed in detail with respect to ). In an exemplary embodiment, the cavity  has a diameter Dbetween 3 mm to 18 mm. In another embodiment, the diameter Dof the cavity  is between 8 mm to 10 mm.The rotary cutter  further comprises a plurality of spaced-apart ridges  protruding from the outer surface  of the cylindrical body . The ridges  extend radially outward from the outer surface  of the cylindrical body  and terminate in convex outer surfaces  that collectively define a reference cylinder (delineated by dotted circle C-C of ) that is concentric to the longitudinal axis B-B and has a diameter D. In an exemplary embodiment, the diameter Dis less than or equal to 20 mm. In another embodiment, the diameter Dis between 6 mm to 20 mm. In yet another embodiment, the diameter Dis between 12 mm to 14 mm. In certain embodiments, a ratio of the longitudinal width Wof the head  to the diameter Dof the reference cylinder-C-C is between 2.8 and 3.7, and more specifically the ratio, is between 3.1 and 3.4. Furthermore, in some embodiments a ratio of the transverse width Wof the head . to the diameter Dof the reference cylinder C-C is between 1.0 and 1.35, and more Specifically the ratio is between 1.1 and 1.25.Each of the ridges  includes a sharpened cutting edge . In the exemplified embodiment, each of the cutting edges  is formed by the sharp intersection of the convex outer surfaces  of the ridges  and concave sidewall surfaces  of the ridges . As a result of the aforementioned structure, the rotary cutter  comprises a plurality of spaced-apart cutting edges  extending from the outer surface  of the cylindrical body .In the exemplified embodiment, the spaced-apart ridges  (and thus the spaced-apart cutting edges ) are in a helical configuration about the cylindrical body . In an alternative embodiment, the spaced-apart ridges  (and thus the spaced-apart cutting edges ) can have a helical configuration twisted in one direction (hand) from a first end  of the rotary cutter  to a mid-point of the rotary cutter , and then twisted in the opposite direction (opposite hand) from that mid-point of rotary cutter  to the second end  of the rotary cutter . Such a bi-directional helical rotary cutter  may he used to impel the hair bristle debris to a mid-point along the head  or away therefrom, thereby facilitating removal of the debris.In further embodiments, the rotary cutter  can be of a segmental configuration, namely the rotary cutter  can be collectively formed by a plurality of cylindrical segments, or hollow cylinder slices, wherein each segment is formed with a plurality of evenly-spaced, outwardly-projecting ribs  and cutting edges  on its outer surface, and each slice is shifted by a, small angle with respect to its adjacent neighboring slice. In an even further embodiment, the rotary cutter  can be (or form part of) the outer housing of the motor , which also acts as the rotor component of the motor while the stator of the motor  would be the core.Referring now to FIGS.  and A-B, when the head  is assembled for operation, the fixed blade  is mounted adjacent the rotary cutter . In one embodiment, the fixed blade  is mounted adjacent the rotary cutter  so that the cutting edge  of the fixed blade  extends substantially parallel to the axis of rotation of the rotary cutter , which in the exemplified embodiment is the longitudinal axis B-B. In the exemplified embodiment, such adjacent positioning is achieved by mounting the fixed blade  to the tubular housing  so that the cutting edge  of the fixed blade  extends into the slot  and adjacent the cutting edges  of the rotary cutter .In one embodiment, the fixed blade  is “fixed” with, respect to its radial distance from the axis of rotation B-B of the rotary cutter . As used herein, the term “fixed” is intended to cover embodiments where small vibrations may be imparted to the fixed blade  and/or wherein the fixed blade  may axially translate slightly in a manner that maintains the cutting edge  substantially parallel to axis of rotation B-B and its radial distance therefrom. In certain other embodiments, the fixed blade  may be completely stationary and immovable with respect to both the axis of rotation B-B and the tubular housing .When the exemplified embodiment is assembled, the cutting edge  of the fixed blade  extends along the entire length of the rotary cutter . The cutting edge  of the fixed blade  is sufficiently proximate the cutting edges  of the rotary cutter  so as to be effective in cooperating with the cutting edges  of the rotary cutter  to shear hair bristles therebetween during a cutting operation when the motor  is activated and the front face  of the head  is pressed against and moved along the skin. In one embodiment, a tolerance, in the form of a cutting gap  is designed to exist between the cutting edge  of the fixed blade  and the cutting edges  of the rotary cutter  during a cutting operation. In one embodiment, the cutting gap  is no greater than 0.5 mm, and optionally no greater than 2.5 mm. In one embodiment, the cutting gap  has a fixed size and thus can not be varied and/or adjusted. As shown in , the cutting edges  of the rotary cutter  oppose the cutting edge  of the fixed blade  during shearing, of the user's hair between the cutting edge  of the fixed blade  and the cutting edges  of the rotary cutter .Referring now to  and , the structural cooperation of the various components the head  in the assembled state will be further discussed. When the head  is assembled for use, the motor  is positioned in the cavity  of the rotary cutter  and operably coupled thereto so as to be capable of rotating the rotary cutter  about the longitudinal axis B-B.According to some embodiments of the present invention, the motor  is an electric motor and is electrically coupled to the power source  housed in the handle  as described below: When the motor  is electric, the motor  can be powered by alternating or direct current. In certain embodiments, the motor  may be a brushless type motor or a brushed, motor type; and/or may be a cored or coreless type motor. For example, a brushless DC electric motor is a synchronous electric motor which powered by direct-current electricity and has an electronically controlled commutation system (a “controller”) instead of a mechanical commutation system based on brushes, as present in the brushed motors.The motor  is dimensioned so as to be locatable within the cavity  of the rotary cutter . In one embodiment, the motor  has an outer diameter that is equal to or less than 12 mm. In another embodiment, the motor  has an outer diameter between 3 mm to 12 mm. In yet another embodiment, the motor  has an outer diameter between 3 min to 10 mm. In a yet further embodiments, the motor  has an outer diameter between 3 mm to 8 mm.It is noted herein that the term “motor”, which is used herein interchangeably with the phrase “electric motor assembly,” is intended to encompass the assembly of parts which transform electrical power to mechanical motion as a required output force/torque and speed. Adjustment of torque and speed is typically achieved by including a gear and/or another form of transmission element in the electric motor assembly.As discussed hereinabove, the size of motor  is selected such that it can rotate the rotary cutter  at a sufficient torque and speed so as to effect shaving, considering the minimal contact between rotary cutter  and the user's skin, and considering the force required to cut more than one hair simultaneously. Since motor performance correlates to the size of the motor , the size limitation of the motor  can be derived from the following considerations: (i) the need for a compact minimal motor size which projects on the width of the shaving head and the size requirements of the power source (battery); and (ii) the need for sufficient torque and speed to accomplish fast and efficient shearing Of more than one hair strand at the same timeThe assembly of the rotary cutter  and the motor  is, in turn, located within the internal cavity  of the tubular housing . The first end cap  is coupled to the first end  of the tubular housing . The first end cap  encloses a first end of the internal cavity  of the tubular housing  and a first end of the cavity  of the rotary cutter . Similarly, the second end cap  is coupled to the second end  of the tubular housing . The second end cap  encloses a second end of the internal cavity  of the tubular housing  and a second end of the cavity  of the rotary cutter  The first end cap  forms a first transverse wall  at the first end  of the tubular housing  while the second end cap  forms a second transverse wall  at the second end  of the tubular housing . These transverse walls ,  assist in sealing the cavity  of the rotary cutter  from the ingress of water and other liquids that may damage the motor  and electrical connectors A, B. Of course, in certain alternate embodiments, the transverse end walls ,  do not have to be formed by cap-like components but can be integrally formed as part of the tubular housing  or be mere plates or blocks extending from the handle . Furthermore, while the transverse walls ,  are exemplified as flat plate-like structures, in alternate embodiments, the transverse walls ,  can take the form of posts, blocks, struts and/or combinations thereof, and can also be contoured and/or inclined as desired.Each of the transverse walls ,  (or end caps , ) comprise an inwardly extending axial posts , . The first annular bearing  is mounted to the first axial post  while the second annular bearing  is mounted to the second axial post . In the exemplified embodiment, both of the annular bearings ,  are of the ball-bearing type. However, bearing types that can be used in the context of the present invention include, without limitation, plain bearings, also known as sliding or slipping, bearing which are based on rubbing surfaces and typically a lubricant (implemented by use of hard metals or plastics such as PTFE which has coefficient of friction of about 0.05); rolling element bearing, also known as ball bearings which are based on balls or rollers (cylinders) and restriction rings; or magnetic bearings and flexure bearings. In certain embodiments, the annular bearings ,  could take the form of the outer annular surfaces of the axial posts , , so long as these outer annular surfaces have been designed to achieve a desired coefficient of friction with the moving part in contact therewith. In certain alternate embodiments, at least one of the bearings may not be annular in nature. Finally, the term “annular” may include segmentally annular in certain embodiments.The first annular bearing  rotatably mounts the first end  of the rotary cutter  to the first transverse wall  while the second annular bearing  rotatably mounts the second end  of the rotary cutter  to the second transverse wall . The first annular bearing  nests within the cavity  of the rotary cutter  and is coupled to the first end  of the rotary cutter  via contact/engagement with the inner surface  of rotary cutter . The second annular bearing , however, abuts the second end  of the rotary cutter  and is coupled to the second end  of the rotary cutter  via bearing posts  (best shown in ). Because the second annular bearing  is not positioned within the cavity  of the rotary cutter , it has a larger central opening  than the central opening (not numbered) of the first annular bearing . More specifically, the central opening  of the second annular bearing  has a transverse cross-sectional area that is greater than the transverse cross-sectional area of the central opening of the first annular bearing . This, in turn, allows the second axial post  to have a larger transverse cross-sectional area (when compared to the transverse cross-sectional area of the first axial post ). In certain embodiments, this is beneficial because the increased transverse cross-sectional area of the second axial post  allows the second axial post  to maintain its strength and structural integrity despite having a channel  formed therein through which the electrical connectors A, B axially extend.The motor  is mounted within the cavity  of the rotary cutter . In the exemplified embodiment, the motor  is mounted to the second transverse wall  in a cantilevered manner. More specifically, a first end  of the motor  is mounted to the second transverse wall  while a drive shaft  extends from a second end  of the motor . The drive shaft  non-rotatably mates with an internal shaft-engagement element , which is in the form of a transverse wall that is non-rotatably coupled to the cylindrical body  of the rotary cutter . It will thug he seen that the rotary cutter  is driven by the motor  via the mating between the internal shaft-engagement piece  and the drive shaft , and is mounted by the annular bearings ,  at its ends , , thereby providing a balanced coupling of the rotary cutter  to the motor  and the rotary cutter  within the tubular housing .As mentioned above, the motor  is electrically powered by the power source  in the handle . The motor  is electrically coupled to the power source  by electrical connectors A, B which, in the exemplified embodiment are wires. In alternate embodiments, the electrical connectors take on other forms, including plating of surfaces with electrically conductive materials. The electrical connectors A, B are operably coupled to the motor  at one end and extend axially from the motor  through the second annular bearing  via the channel . Once through the annular bearing , the electrical connectors A, B extend radially away from the longitudinal axis B-B and into the handle  via the most desirable path selected.There are clear advantages in having the entire driving mechanism housed within the head , including a compact design and the locating of all of the motorized moving parts within the head . Such a design also eliminates the need to house the motor  or parts of the drive transmission mechanism in a separate housing. Such design further enables substantially quiet and substantially vibration, free operation due to the central and coaxial position of the motor and rotor. Further, a minimal number of moving parts is required, which in turn contributes to the minimization of energy loss due to friction, slack and slippage, thereby substantially decreasing, the noise and vibrations, as well as the wear and tear plaguing many of the presently known drive transmission mechanisms.Another advantage afforded by the concept of the internally motorized head  presented herein, is the ability to arrive at very high speeds of rotation of the rotary cutter unit, driven by an internal driving mechanism. Hence, the scissors-like cutting action (energy-efficient cutting mechanism) coupled with an internally motorized shaving head. affords the use of relatively small, low-energy and high-speed electric motors.The internally motorized shaving head can be constructed with an internal driving mechanism having, a capacity to rotate the rotary cutter unit at a speed of at least 300 revolutions per minute (rmp). Alternatively, the rotational speed of the rotary cutter unit may be at least 500 rpm, 800 rpm, 1000 rpm, 1500 rpm, 2000 rpm, 3000 rpm, 4000 rpm, 5000 rpm, 7000 rpm, 10000 rpm, 12000 rpm, 15000 rpm, 20000 rpm, 25000 rpm, 30000 rpm, 40000 rpm and 50000 rpm.The optimal speed of rotation is effected by several factors, including the choice of electric motor, the current and voltage supplied to the electric motor, and optionally by use of an inline drive transmission, namely a particular assembly of gears, pins and the like, normally used to reduce or increase the output speed of a motor. Thus, the electric motor assembly may include an inline transmission device to control the output speed and torque of the electric motor in the internally motorized shaving head presented herein. As used herein, the phrase “inline transmission device” refers to a drive transmission device, or gearbox, which is placed inline with the motor, namely the motor output shaft and the gearbox output shaft share the same axis of rotation. An inline transmission device may include epicyclic gearing, or planetary gearing. Such an inline gearing system can be selected so as to increase the torque of the motor and reduce its speed or the opposite, depending on the selected motor and desired terminal rotation output. It is to be understood that various parts of the internally motorized shaving head presented herein are presented as discrete and separate parts for the sake of clarity and definition. However, some of the parts described herein can be manufactured as a union with other parts, forming a single continuous unit, while some parts described herein as single continuous units can be formed by a plurality of sub-parts.Referring now to , an alternate embodiment of the head  is exemplified. In this alternate embodiment, a portion of the motor  extends through the second annular bearing  rather than the electrical connectors A, B. Moreover, the second annular bearing  is mounted to the motor  while the second axial post  is omitted.As used throughout, ranges are used as shorthand for describing each and every value that is within the range. Any value within the range can be selected as the terminus of the range. In addition, all references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. In the event of a conflict in a definition in the present disclosure and that of a cited reference, the present disclosure controls.The shaving apparatus, according to some embodiments of the present invention, equipped with the shaving head according to some embodiments presented herein, can be used to effect close shave of hair bristles, such as human facial hair, rapidly and safely.Unlike traditional manual or mechanized scrapers, the shaving, apparatus presented herein can be used with or without lubrication or wetting of the skin prior to or during the shaving process. Hence, since the shaving apparatus presented herein is based on scissors-action rather than pure scraping, the apparatus can be used effectively under wet or dry conditions substantially without requiring pretreatment or Conditioning of the hair or skin. The phrase “pretreatment or conditioning of the hair or skin,” as used herein, refers to any form of wetting the skin/hair by the application of water, a pre-shaving composition, a lotion and/or foam. It is noted herein that pretreatment or conditioning of the hair or skin is not a prerequisite but an option of the shaving process using the shaving apparatus presented herein.One exemplary mode of use of the shaving apparatus presented herein starts with a user gripping the apparatus at handle , and switching switch  thereby turning the apparatus to the operational (“on”) state, which means that rotary cutter  of the head  is rotating as a result of the rotation of motor , which is powered by power sourceOnce the apparatus is operational, the user presses front face  of the shaving head  flat on his/her skin, and glides the head  across the skin at a direction which is generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis B-B. The direction of motion can be a forward or a backward motion. However, hair is shaved (or trimmed) essentially without movement of the head  with respect to the skin's surface as hair shearing occurs as a result of the relative motion between the cutting edges  of the rotary cutter  and the fixed blade , and regardless of the relative motion of the head  to the user's skin. It is noted herein that the shaving process using the shaving apparatus presented herein cart be carried out by lifting and re-contacting the head  with the surface of the skin. However, in certain embodiments, the head  is moved by the user across the skin's surface while the head  is pressed against the surface of the skin so as to effect shaving at other areas of the skin surface in a continuous manner.The shaving head presented herein can also effect hair cutting at any distance from the skin (where the hair follicle is found), leaving trimmed hair. This hair trimming can be achieved by adding an extension to the shaving head or building in a desired tolerance/gap, allowing the front face  of the head  to be placed on the hair growing surface at a pre-determined distance which corresponds to the length of the trimmed hair.As used throughout, ranges are used as shorthand for describing each and every value that is within the range. Any value within the range can be selected as the terminus of the range. In addition, all references cited herein are hereby incorporated by referenced in their entireties. In the event of a conflict in a definition in the present disclosure and that of a cited reference, the present disclosure controls.While the foregoing description and drawings represent the exemplary embodiments, of the present invention, it will be understood that various additions, modifications and substitutions may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined in the accompanying claims. In particular, it will be clear to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms, structures, arrangements, proportions, sizes, and with other elements, materials, and components, without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. One skilled, in the art will appreciate that the invention may be used with many modifications of structure, arrangement, proportions, sizes, materials, and components and otherwise, used in the practice of the invention, which are particularly adapted to specific environments and operative requirements without departing from the principles of the present invention. The presently disclosed embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being defined by the appended claims, and not limited to the foregoing description or embodiments."

                "The present application is related to and claims priority from prior provisional application Ser. No. 61/359,898, filed Jun. 30, 2010 which application is incorporated herein by reference.A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. 37 CFR .().The following includes information that may be useful in understanding the present invention(s). It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art, or material, to the presently described or claimed inventions, or that any publication or document that is specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art.The present invention relates generally to the field of scissors and more specifically relates to a device for simultaneously cutting and coloring a craft item.Making your own arts and crafts is an excellent way to both express yourself creatively and at the same time produce decorative items. There is a wide variety of crafts that people may enjoy making. Whether it is a special craft project for a birthday party, decorating a home with handmade items, creating jewelry, or making holiday decorations, people enjoy being creative and using their imagination to complete fun projects.Paper crafts, such as making greeting cards, gift wrap, or party invitations have become increasingly popular, especially when it comes to arts and craft projects which can be performed at home. An additional benefit is that craft projects may help to keep children occupied. People who enjoy arts and crafts are always looking for new tools to add to their collection. Many individuals enjoy using different kinds of scissors to add creativity to their project. Pinking shears, for example, create a wavy edge on cut objects, which has more character than a straight edge. People that enjoy crafts appreciate anything that adds originality and uniqueness.Scissors are commonly used for paper crafts and other craft projects. Unfortunately, most scissors only have one function, which is to cut an item. Therefore a need exists for scissors which have more than one function and which may be used to simultaneously cut and color an item so as to add more variety and uniqueness to craft projects.Various attempts have been made to solve the above-mentioned problems such as those found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,523,264, 4,891,882, 4,783,907, 3,107,425, 2,826,859, and 643,377. This prior art is representative of scissors. None of the above inventions and patents, taken either singly or in combination, is seen to describe the invention as claimed.Ideally, a device for simultaneously cutting and coloring material should require little maintenance, be easy to use, and, yet, would operate reliably and be manufactured at a modest expense. Thus, a need exists for a reliable device for simultaneously cutting and coloring material and to avoid the above-mentioned problems.In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known scissors art, the present invention provides a novel Color and Cut Craft Scissors System. The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a device for simultaneously cutting and coloring a craft item.The device for simultaneously cutting and coloring a craft item disclosed herein preferably comprises the following components: a first cutting blade having a first handle, a set of apertures, an outside inclined surface and an inside planar surface; a second cutting blade having a second handle; a reservoir containing a coloring substance; a coloring-substance-distributor; and at least one connection tube in communication with the set of apertures, the reservoir and the coloring-substance-distributor.The first cutting blade is pivotally mounted relative to the second cutting blade. The reservoir is affixed to the outside inclined surface of the first cutting blade and contains the coloring substance. The coloring-substance-distributor is integral with the inside planar surface of the first cutting blade. The reservoir and the coloring-substance-distributor are connected via the connection tube which communicates the coloring substance through the set of apertures such that the coloring substance may be deposited on the craft item during a cutting activity. The coloring-substance-distributor is activated via sliding the first cutting blade and the second cutting blade against each other and creating a wicking capillary movement of the coloring substance onto the craft item.A kit is also described herein including the device for simultaneously cutting and coloring a craft item, at least one reservoir filled with the coloring substance, at least one coloring-substance-distributor, and a set of user instructions.In accordance with the embodiments of the present invention a preferred method of use is disclosed herein comprising: attaching a full reservoir containing a coloring substance to an outside inclined surface of a first cutting blade of a pair of scissors; connecting the reservoir to a coloring-substance-distributor which is integral with an inside planar surface of the first cutting blade via at least one connection tube; activating the coloring-substance-distributor via cutting the craft item and sliding the first cutting blade and a second cutting blade against each other; and thereby creating a colored border along the cut material.The present invention holds significant improvements and serves as a Color and Cut Craft Scissors System. For purposes of summarizing the invention, certain aspects, advantages, and novel features of the invention have been described herein. It is to be understood that not necessarily all such advantages may be achieved in accordance with any one particular embodiment of the invention. Thus, the invention may be embodied or carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or group of advantages as taught herein without necessarily achieving other advantages as may be taught or suggested herein.

                "This application is a Continuation-In-Part of application Ser. No. 11/466,340. This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61/402,688 filed on Sep. 1, 2010.Not Applicable.This invention relates to pocket knives, and more particularly, to a novel non-snagging, automatically deploying and retracting pocket clip for such a knife.Clips for retaining a pocket knife onto a pair of pants or pants pocket are known in the art. Generally, such clips are elongated and protrude conspicuously from one side of the object, being rigidly fixed thereto. In the case of a pocket knife, U.S. Design Pat. No. 487,628 exemplifies such a clip. While such a clip does help retain a knife onto an object, such as a pants pocket, it is obtrusive and can snag on items undesirably while deployed in a pocket in the conventional manner; with pocket knife on the inside of the pocket and clip on the outside of the pocket. Such snagging can result in damage to the clip, the pocket and/or the snagged object.The presence of a pocket clip on the side of a knife results in discomfort as the tool is gripped in the hand. Furthermore, the presence of such a clip can be aesthetically objectionable, which is an especially important consideration in the field of folding knives wherein the details of form and style are very important to the commercial success of the product.To overcome these drawbacks retractable clips have been devised. For example, US Patent Application 2002/0153395 to Martinez on Oct. 24, 2002 teaches a belt clip that pivots away from the body of the knife, generally perpendicular to the pivot plane of the blade. U.S. Pat. No. 6,941,604 to Ackeret, on Sep. 13, 2005 teaches a similar retracting clip. One of the fundamental deficiencies of clips so configured is that the space between the clip and the knife necessarily decreases in depth toward the pivot point of the clip. As fabric or other object is moved toward the pivot point, the open-end portion of the clip is forced further from the body of the assembly, the clip invariably protruding at an increasingly pronounced angle away from the assembly, becoming more of an encumbrance than convenience. Also, such clips do not tend to retain the knife to objects well, since such clips necessarily bind the object toward their pivot point specifically and not their distal ends. As a result, the object is pinched only in a small area, and as such, the knife can easily become dislodged if jolted.US Patent Application 2004/0129746 to Lee et al. on Jul. 8, 2004, and US Patent Application 2006/0113985A to Gist et al. on Jun. 1, 2006, both teach belt clips for objects in one case a phone and in the other case an electronic hand tool. These clips overcome some of the disadvantages mentioned heretofore, but still dispose the clip itself to snagging and damage if deployed in a pocket in such a way that the tool is inside the pocket and the clip outside, which is the traditional method of carrying knives equipped with pocket clips.Additional to the aforementioned deficiencies, the cited retractable pocket clips are deployed by an exclusive manual action, the practice of which constitutes an inconvenient prerequisite to the act of securely storing a pocket knife into the pocket.U.S. Pat. No. 7,451,545 to Voros teaches a retractable pocket clip that is coordinated with the movement of the blade to and from an extended position by means of an actuating linkage between the blade and clip. The disclosed “actuating assembly” involves complication and requires substantial space to one side of the blade in order to contain, necessarily resulting in a an undesirably thick folding knife assembly. There are also several sliding friction surfaces moving within multiple planes necessary to the actuation and guidance of the clip along its rectilinear travel, which is particularly undesirable in a tool that is likely to be fouled with foreign matter during regular use. Furthermore, while either extended or retracted, the presence of such a clip is aesthetically conspicuous which is an important consideration in the field of folding knives wherein the details of form and style are very important to the commercial success of a product.Additionally, like other references mentioned heretofore, the clip is disposed to snagging on objects resulting in damage to such objects and to itself when deployed within a pocket in the aforementioned traditional manner. That is because, when so deployed in a pants pocket, the clip extends outwardly generally perpendicular to the mean exterior surface of the pocket. The clip becomes more prominent still, being necessarily situated directly atop the bulge that is created by the knife when carried in the pants pocket. It is therefore uniquely exposed to snagging hazards and damage during the course of regular deployment within a pants pocket.In accordance with the present invention, all the above-stated problems are solved by providing a folding knife with a retractable pocket clip that moves substantially in an arc between retracted and deployed positions generally within the same pivot plane as a pivotally folding blade and whose movement between retracted and deployed positions is coordinated through direct contact with the blade so that the clip is automatically deployed for use as the blade is pivoted into it's storage position and automatically retracted when the blade is pivoted to a position for use; the pocket clip thereby uniquely disappearing completely within the outer periphery of the knife assembly in the retracted position and extending beyond the outer periphery of the knife assembly in the deployed position generally within the same pivot plane as the blade.At the heart of the present invention, is applicant's discovery that a pocket clip extending generally within the aforementioned plane is uniquely sheltered from snagging hazards while the knife, so equipped, is worn as customary; with knife in the pocket and clip outside the pocket. With the knife so deployed in the pocket, the clip is substantially below the mean exterior surface of the pocket due to its position relative to the bulge necessarily created by the knife in the pocket. This constitutes a counterintuitive advancement in the art of pocket clips for folding knives.Additionally applicant has discovered and herein discloses a unique and unexpected retentive tendency provided by a clip so configured. In contrast with conventional pocket clips, which bind a knife to a pants pocket edge by pinching spring tension, the knife of the present invention enjoys a retentive tendency generated between the clip and knife as the pocket edge is caused to bend or kink once around the knife and again as it passes under the clip. As a result, localized tension is advantageously generated along the pocket edge and maintained by compression exerted upon the body of the knife as it rests within the pocket.illustrate a folding knife A () comprising two rigid members  spaced generally parallel to each other thereby forming a channel  (). A pivot  (, B) is provided that permits the blade A to pivot between a storage position  () and a position for use  () within a pivot plane and about a pivot axis  (), the pivot plane being generally perpendicular to pivot axis .It is to be understood that, as used herein, “blade” can refer to a number of items, including a tool, implement, cutting blade, or a holder for such tool, implement or cutting blade, and is not to be limited to the blade depicted in the Figures.The clip A () of the first embodiment is not readily detachable, being rigidly fixed from an attachment end  to at least one rigid member  (, C). In this embodiment, this is accomplished by a fastener  which may alternatively be substituted for other attachment means.Clip A includes a flexure portion . In this embodiment, flexure portion  is located generally intermediate clip A between attachment end  and moving end  () and allows moving end  to move substantially in an arc relative to attachment end  and substantially within the pivot plane of blade A.Clip A further includes an elongated free end  near moving end  (). Elongated free end  is configured to define a space wherein fabric or other material may be inserted.further show that moving end  of clip A features a blade-engagement surface A, the purpose of which is made clear in light of its interaction with pivoting blade A that includes a tang having a clip-engagement surface A (, C) that extends generally radially outwardly with respect to pivot axis  (). Because of this, clip-engagement surface A necessarily displaces clip A as blade A is moved to storage position  () by direct interaction with blade-engagement surface A of clip A (, C). The result is that elongated free end  is projected beyond the outer periphery of rigid members  and therefore made available for use, having reached deployed position  ().further show that extension of clip A beyond deployed position  is prevented by a boss  which projects from clip A, generally perpendicular to the pivot plane. Boss  moves within a corresponding slot  in at least one rigid member  until it collides with the end of slot , preventing further movement in that direction.further depict flexure portion  as configured to provide constant urging force by spring tension to bias moving end  of clip A against clip-engagement surface A of blade A. This ensures that as blade A is pivoted to position for use  (), clip A moves progressively to retracted position . That is because, relative to blade-engagement surface A of clip A, clip-engagement surface A of blade A recedes generally inwardly with respect to pivot axis  as blade A is pivoted toward position for use .In use, clip A automatically moves between retracted position  and deployed position  generally within the same pivot plane as pivotally folding blade A (, A to C). This movement between retracted position  and deployed position  (, C) is coordinated with the movement of blade A by direct interaction between blade A and clip A. As a result, elongated free end  is automatically deployed for use as blade A is pivoted into storage position  and automatically retracted to a point substantially contained between the two rigid members  of knife A when blade A is pivoted to position for use .As shown in , when clip A is in deployed position  (), and an object, such as a pants pocket edge , for example, is positioned between elongated free end  and knife A, knife A is retained to the pocket  by friction generated from tension. More specifically, a unique retentive tendency is produced between elongated free end  and knife A. That is because pocket edge  is caused to bend once around knife A and again as it passes under elongated free end  (). Localized tension is advantageously generated along pocket edge  between elongated free end  and knife A and maintained as knife A is held flat in pocket  by compression generated between pocket  and the body of the user as parts are worn. With knife A so positioned in pocket , such compression from pocket  is directed generally perpendicular to the pivot plane of blade A and is the natural result of the presence of knife A within pocket .With knife A so deployed in pocket , free end  is sheltered from snagging and abrasion by the bulge  created by knife A in pocket  while knife A is worn as show in . Free end  is recessed below the mean outer surface of pocket  relative to bulge  and is consequently substantially less likely to cause damage to objects that come into contact with the mean outer surface of pocket  and bulge  while knife A is worn in pants pocket , nor is it so readily inclined to snag disadvantageously upon such objects.Alternatively, clip A may be configured to remain in deployed position  (). This may be accomplished by biasing flexure  to constantly urge clip A toward deployed position . If desired, clip A may be locked into deployed position  by replacing slot  in rigid member  with a hole (not shown) into which boss  may fit and that is positioned concentric with boss  while clip A is in deployed position , thus constraining movement of moving end .A second embodiment of the present invention, alternate knife B, is shown in , and in . In this embodiment, alternate clip B is pivotally connected from attachment end  to alternate rigid member  by means of a rear pivot  which permits alternate clip B to pivot between deployed position  and retracted position  within a pivot plane and about a rear pivot axis  () which is substantially parallel with pivot axis  and substantially perpendicular to the pivot plane. Consequently, alternate clip B moves substantially within the same pivot plane as alternate blade B and in an arc relative to attachment end  (). It is not configured to be readily detachable from alternate rigid member .Alternate clip B () is continually urged directly against alternate clip engagement surface B of alternate blade B, which extends generally radially outwardly with respect to pivot axis  (), by means of a biasing member  (). Biasing member  is configured to fit into a recess  in alternate rigid member  () and to urge alternative clip B toward retracted position  by spring tension so that free end  of alternative clip B is continually biased directly against alternate clip engagement surface B of alternate blade B.In use, elongated free end  is moved to deployed position  as alternate blade B is moved to storage position  (). Conversely, as alternate blade B is moved to position for use  (), alternate clip B, being constantly urged against alternate clip engagement surface B by biasing member , moves to retracted position  as clip engagement surface B recedes generally inwardly with respect to pivot axis .As shown in , blade engagement surface B may be configured to interact with alternate clip engagement surface B in a manner that alternate clip B will selectively impede pivoting movement of alternate blade B from position for use  toward storage position  while alternate clip B is in retracted position .While embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described using specific terms, such description is for present illustrative purposes only and it is to be understood that changes and variations to such embodiments, including but not limited to the substitution of equivalent features of parts and the reversal of various features thereof, may be practiced by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit or scope of the following claims."

                "1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a pair of barber scissors in which two blade bodies that intersect each other for haircutting make sliding movement relatively to each other in haircutting operation.2. Related ArtA well-known basic configuration of a pair of barber scissors includes two blade bodies, each having a cutting blade and a handle (a thumb/finger hole portion), that intersect each other in an X-shape state; a shaft hole that penetrates through the two blade bodies and is arranged at the intersecting point of the blade bodies; and a pivotal joint shaft, inserted in the shaft hole, that pivotally fastens the intersecting point so that the blade bodies can be freely operated in an opening-and-closing manner.The barber scissors are mainly used by barbers for haircutting. Accordingly, scissors that are more easy-to-use and have better cutting quality are required. In order to meet such requirements, the scissors having a structure in which the cutting blades apply a shearing force while moving in a cutting edge direction (that is, a relative sliding-cutting structure, hereinafter referred to as “sliding-cutting structure”) are proposed. The scissors having a sliding-cutting structure are different from the scissors in the past that apply a shearing force orthogonal to hair to be cut.As examples, the following structures are known: a structure in which a pivotal joint shaft is fixed to one blade body (lower blade body, operated by a thumb in use) while a pivotal joint portion of the other blade body (upper blade body, operated by a middle finger in use) is configured of an elongated hole so that the pivotal joint shaft is capable of moving in a cutting edge line direction and in which a groove that slants with respect to the cutting edge line direction and a projection corresponding to the groove are provided on an opposing sliding surface of the blade bodies (JP-A-10-179951); a structure in which two shafts are provided in an axial portion (serving as a pivotal joint) of a lower blade body while an insertion hole which is arranged in an upper blade body and through which the above-mentioned axial portion passes is formed in an arc shape or L-shape (JP-A-11-114242 and so on); a structure in which the pivotal joint shafts of an upper blade body and a lower blade body are arranged eccentrically (JP-B-04-59919); and so forth.Since the aforementioned structure of sliding movement of the upper blade body is basically a structure of crank motion, a user feels discomfort in operation compared to the barber scissors usually used whose blade bodies make pivotal movement about a pivotal joint shaft. In other words, the user feels easy with a structure in which a rotational movement about the pivotal joint shaft and a sliding movement are coincident with each other in appearance. Therefore, a structure in which a pinion gear mounted on a pivotal joint shaft and a rack in the upper blade body are combined to implement sliding-cutting is also proposed (Patent references 1 and 2).In Patent reference 1 (JP-UM-A-60-149382), a structure of a pair of scissors is described in which a large rectangular hole is provided at a pivotal joint portion of the upper blade body, a rack is formed on the inner periphery of the rectangular hole, along shaft hole is provided in the bottom surface (outer surface of the scissors) to affix a gear box therein, a pinion gear to engage with the rack is mounted on a pivotal joint shaft that is penetratingly disposed integrating the lower blade body, and a coupling pin is mounted on a shaft portion protruding from the long shaft hole to serve as a retaining pin.Further in Patent reference 2 (JP-A-62-170284), a structure of a pair of scissors is described in which a large elongated hole is provided at a pivotal joint portion of the upper blade body, a rack is formed on the inner periphery of the elongated hole, a pinion gear integrally mounted in the lower blade body is incorporated into the elongated hole, and a nut is screwed on a pivotal joint shaft protruding from the pinion gear.Listed below are reference documents.Patent reference 1: JP-UM-A-60-149382\n\nPatent reference 2: JP-A-62-170284In the aforementioned sliding-cutting structure in which a pinion gear and a rack are engaged, the nut that is screwed on a pivotal joint shaft (gear shaft) works as a member to prevent the upper blade body from being decoupled, whereas at the same time, sliding motion between the upper and lower blade bodies takes place during haircutting operation; this sliding motion causes the nut to be loosened. As a result, pinching force applied to the upper and lower blade bodies is lessened, thereby reducing sharpness of the scissors.If, instead of using a nut member, a pin member that does not cause the loosening is used as described in Patent reference 1, an adjusting function to achieve a desired pinching force cannot be equipped with.In order to realize a smooth engagement between a pinion gear and a rack, the engagement having a slight margin is desirable rather than the engagement with no margin in which no shaky motion takes place; however, the engagement with a margin can cause undesirable shaky motion of the blade bodies during haircutting operation.Furthermore, a sliding-cutting structure adopting a rack and pinion needs a space in a pivotal joint shaft portion for the movement of the pinion. However, small pieces of cut hair are likely to come into this space. Accordingly, if the small pieces of cut hair are not adequately removed, they are dragged into a sliding space and lessen the blade body operability.A tip portion rather than a root portion (pivotal joint shaft side) of the cutting blade is used in haircutting operation. However, specific consideration is not given to the sliding movement of the tip portion of the cutting blade because the blade body rotation angle and the blade body sliding distance have a constant relationship in the sliding-cutting structure adopting a rack and pinion.The present invention provides a pair of barber scissors having a sliding-cutting structure adopting a rack and pinion. Although the barber scissors with a sliding-cutting structure adopting a rack and pinion have not actually been productized due to various problems, the barber scissors of the present invention can be put into practical use by having a novel sliding-cutting structure in which a combination mechanism of rack and pinion is much improved.A pair of barber scissors according to a first aspect of the invention has a structure in which two blade bodies, each having a cutting blade and a handle, intersect each other in an X-shape state and the intersecting point is structured as a pivotal joint so that the cutting blades are made openable and closable, and includes: a gear accommodation hole adequately formed at the intersecting point of one blade body (usually formed in an upper blade body, so hereinafter referred to as “upper blade body” for convenience); a rack formed on the inner surface of the gear accommodation hole in a longitudinal direction of the blade body; a pinion that has arc-shaped teeth to engage with the rack and is arranged in a pivotal joint shaft position of the other blade body (lower blade body) so as to rotate together with the lower blade body; a guide member that has a projection to fit into a guide groove extended in a blade body handle direction on the outer surface of the upper blade body in the vicinity of the gear accommodation hole and that is disposed striding the outer surface of the gear accommodation hole; a shaft hole formed in the guide member through which a pivotal joint screw shaft passes in an upright fashion from the pinion; and a nut that is screwed and mounted on the pivotal joint screw shaft protruding from the guide member.When the blade bodies are operated in an opening-and-closing manner, the upper blade body rotates while making a sliding movement relative to the lower blade body due to the engagement between the rack and the arc-shaped teeth of the pinion, whereby the cutting edges that intersect each other cut hair while making the sliding movement.Specifically in the aforementioned configuration, because the nut is screwed and mounted on the guide member that moves together with the lower blade member (pivotal joint screw shaft) during haircutting operation, a pinching force adjustment of the pivotal joint shaft portion can be carried out as in the case of usual barber scissors, and in addition, the sliding movement of the blade body will not cause the nut to be loosened. Furthermore, because the guide member allows the upper blade body to make sliding movement along the guide groove, the engagement between the rack and the arc-shaped teeth of the pinion is made gentle so as to implement a smooth rotation and slide movement.A pair of barber scissors according to a second aspect of the invention is configured by making the guide member of the scissors of the first aspect of the invention be formed in a shape to wall up only part of the gear accommodation hole and providing a through-hole in the lower blade body in a range corresponding to the gear accommodation hole. With this configuration, even if small pieces of cut hair come into the space inside the gear accommodation hole, they will be removed through the part that is not walled up by the guide member, the through-hole, and the like with ease.Further, a pair of barber scissors according to a fourth aspect of the invention is configured by making the pinion of the scissors of the above-mentioned aspects of the invention be formed in a cam shape in which a radius from the pivotal joint screw shaft as a center to the position of an arc-shaped tooth of the pinion that engages with the rack is longer when an opening angle of the blade bodies is smaller whereas a radius from the pivotal joint screw shaft as the center to the position of an arc-shaped tooth that engages with the rack is shorter when the opening angle of the blade bodies is larger. With this configuration, a relative sliding movement distance between the blade bodies becomes longer when the cutting blade tip portions of the blade bodies, frequently used in haircutting, are being operated (at smaller opening angles), thereby increasing haircutting capability at the portions frequently used in haircutting.The present invention, with the configuration described above, has improved the sharpness of the scissors by allowing the blade bodies to make sliding movement in haircutting operation. In addition, the invention has made it possible to adjust a pinching force with ease against the pivotal joint shaft portion so as to improve the sharpness of the barber scissors and meet requests of a user. As a result, the practicable use of a pair of barber scissors adopting a rack and pinion in a sliding-cutting structure has been achieved.Hereinafter, the preferred embodiments of the invention will be described.  indicate a first embodiment of the invention. A pair of barber scissors according to the first embodiment, as in the case of the past scissors, basically have two blade bodies  and  that intersect each other in an X-shape state at the intersecting portion as a pivotal joint structure so that cutting blades  and  opposing each other are made openable and closable; and include, in addition to the aforementioned blade bodies  and , a shaft member  that forms a pivotal joint structure of the intersecting portion, a pinion (pinion portion) , a guide member , and a nut .The upper blade body  includes the cutting blade  and a handle (finger hole) , in which a gear accommodation hole  is adequately formed in an approximately rectangle shape at the intersection portion, a rack  is formed on an inner surface of the gear accommodation hole  on the cutting edge side in the blade body longitudinal direction, and an elongated guide groove  whose length is sufficiently large to correspond to a sliding movement range, mentioned later, from the edge on the handle side of the gear accommodation hole  to the outside surface of the upper blade body  is formed approximately on a center line in the blade body longitudinal direction of the gear accommodation hole .The lower blade body  includes the cutting blade  and a handle (thumb hole) , in which a square hole (not shown) is formed in a pivotal joint shaft portion and a through-hole  is also formed in a predetermined range. The forming range of the through-hole  is set in a range precluding the square hole portion and corresponds to the gear accommodation hole ; the size of the through-hole  is so determined as to prevent the pinion , explained later, from falling out the through-hole  when the pinion  is arranged on the back side surface (scissors friction surface) of the lower blade .The shaft member , basically configured in the same manner as the pivotal joint shaft member of the past technique, includes a square shaft  and a pivotal joint screw shaft  which is extended from the square shaft , and onto which the nut is screwed so that the shaft member  rotates together with the lower blade body .The pinion  includes a square hole  corresponding to the square shaft , is formed approximately in a quarter-circle fan shape centered on the square hole , and further includes arc-shaped teeth  on the outer circumferential portion thereof. The pinion  is arranged inside the gear accommodation hole  and is formed in a size such that it can travel along the rack  within an adequate range while the arc-shaped teeth  engage with the rack .The pinion  may not be provided as an individual member and may be provided as a pinion portion that is directly affixed to the back side of the lower blade body . Furthermore, a pivotal joint screw shaft may be provided projecting from a predetermined position of the pinion portion.The guide member  includes a striding portion  that is wider than the width (lateral direction) of the gear accommodation hole  and an arm portion  that corresponds to the guide groove  so as to be formed approximately in a T-shape. The guide member  further includes a shaft hole  in an appropriate position of the striding portion  to correspond to the pivotal joint screw shaft , and a projection  disposed on the back side of the arm portion  to fit into the guide groove .The elements mentioned above serve to configure a pair of scissors in the following manner: the upper and lower blade bodies  and  are intersected at a pivotal joint structure portion; the shaft member  is inserted and fixed in a square hole of the lower blade body ; the arc-shaped teeth  are engaged with the rack  at a predetermined position; the square shaft  is inserted and mounted in the square hole  so as to integrally combine the pinion  with the lower blade body ; the pivotal joint screw shaft  is inserted in the shaft hole ; the projection  is fitted into the guide groove ; and the nut  is screwed and mounted on the pivotal joint screw shaft  protruding from the upper surface of the guide member  that is arranged striding the gear accommodation hole .In the aforementioned pair of barber scissors, the upper blade body  rotates relative to the lower blade body  while making sliding movement due to the engagement between the rack  and the arc-shaped teeth  of the pinion  when an opening-and-closing operation is performed as usual. Therefore, hair is shorn not only by rotational movement but also by sliding movement.The position of the nut  was on the upper surface of the upper blade body  in the pivotal joint shaft portion in the past technique; in the present embodiment, it has been changed to the upper surface of the guide member . Accordingly, it is a matter of course that a pinching force adjustment can be carried out as in the case of the past scissors. Furthermore, a structure for preventing the nut  from being loosened, for which various methods have been proposed, can be incorporated without difficulty.Further, in the pair of barber scissors according to the embodiment, because the guide member  is formed so as to wall up only part of the gear accommodation hole  and the through-hole  is provided in a range corresponding to the gear accommodation hole  in the lower blade body, there is provided a sufficient space penetrating the blade bodies  and  in the pivotal joint structure portion. Therefore, although small pieces of cut hair are likely to come into the space mentioned above, they can easily go out of the space themselves and can be completely removed by brushing without disassembly of the scissors after haircutting operation.Next, a pair of barber scissors according to a second embodiment will be described with reference to , in which a pinion includes particularly outstanding features.That is, the arc-shaped teeth  of the pinion  of the first embodiment are arranged forming a circular arc and the rotation angle of the pinion  is proportional to the distance of sliding movement. However, in the barber scissors, a tip portion of the cutting blades is mainly used during haircutting; therefore, in order to increase the sharpness of the scissors, it is preferable that the distance of sliding movement be made longer when the tip portion is being used, thereby increasing the effect of the sliding movement.In the second embodiment, as shown in , a distance from the center of a pivotal joint shaft (center of a square hole ) to each of arc-shaped teeth of the pinion is made to change gradually.That is to say, the pinion is formed in a cam shape in which a radius from the shaft member  as a center to the position of an arc-shaped tooth of the pinion that engages with the rack is longer when an opening angle of the blade bodies  and  is smaller, whereas a radius from the shaft member  as the center to the position of an arc-shaped tooth that engages with the rack is shorter when the opening angle of the blade bodies is larger.Along with the adoption of the pinion a gear accommodation hole in an upper blade body is formed in a shape corresponding to the movement track of the pinion while a through-hole in a lower blade body is also formed in an appropriate shape. As for other elements in the configuration, like numbers are used to indicate like and corresponding elements in the first and second embodiments.When the engagement between the rack  and the arc-shaped teeth changes from the state in which the upper and lower blade bodies and are opened as exemplified in , to the state in which the two blade bodies and are closed as in , a distance of sliding movement per rotation angle becomes longer as the opening-and-closing angle of the two blade bodies becomes smaller. This makes the cutting at the tip portion of the cutting edges more effective due to the sliding movement."

                "The present invention relates to the sector of the devices for cutting grass and of the brush cutters, and more in particular the object of the present invention is a grass-cutting head comprising a spool carrying one line (or more lines) exiting from the side of the head for operating in rotation for cutting grass or bushes. To the spool is connected a mechanism allowing a relative rotation to allow unwinding of the line and replace the correct length of the line in the case of breakage or wear. During use, the line is blocked on the head.Different types of heads as that indicated above are well known. Embodiments are described for example in the patent documents EP0525195, EP0784919, WO01/49101. In general, in these heads the mechanism for unwinding the line provides that a portion of the spool projects from the lower base of the outer casing of the head so as to abut against the ground. To an action of pressure of the head on the ground at this projecting portion correspond an axial translation of the spool relative to the casing, with the consequent disengagement of the spool from adequate toothings that make it integral to the casing. Spool and casing are disengaged as follows: the motor continues to rotate the casing whilst the spool is fixed. The two ends of the cutting line (inserted passing through an hole transverse to the hub of the spool and wound around it) develop from the spool and exit from the casing through two adequate passages or holes, and therefore, during the phase of disengaging of the spool from the casing, the cutting line is unwound and guided towards the outside for a given length. In use, the line is blocked on the head due to the effect of two opposite cutting forces (i.e. with direction parallel to the axis of the head) obtained on the line respectively by the spool and by the casing and due to the different axial position of the hole on the hub of the spool and of the passages on the casing.In this type of heads, one of the most typical problem is that of reloading the spool with new line when the old one is finished. To perform this operation it is necessary to rotate the spool by acting on the portion projecting from the casing and to align the two holes of this latter with the hole on the hub of the spool.To allow this alignment, on the projecting portion of the spool are generally present two opposite arrows, which are aligned to the axis of the through hole defined on the hub of the spool. These arrows act as matching means between the angular position between the holes on the casing and the hole for inserting the hub on the spool, when they are carried in correspondence of the first ones, and allow to facilitate the operations of inserting the cutting line in the spool.However, these angular matching arrows for matching between the holes of the casing and of the spool tend to wear quickly, as they are obtained on a rotating surface that comes into contact with the ground. Therefore, when there is the need to reload the head with new line, there aren't more references for helping in aligning the holes.The main object of the present invention is to solve the drawbacks of the grass-cutting heads of the known type described above, providing a grass-cutting head that provides for matching means for the angular position between casing and spool, to facilitate the insertion of the cutting line (or cutting lines), which are resistant over time and easy to be used.This and other objects, which will be explained hereunder, are achieved with a grass-cutting head comprising a spool for winding at least one cutting line and an housing for the at least one cutting line, wherein said housing comprises a first part and a second part coupled to each other so as to allow at least one reciprocal angular movement around the axis of rotation of the grass-cutting head. The housing presents at least one passage towards the outside for a cutting line. On the spool is defined at least one portion for inserting a cutting line so that to each rotation of the spool corresponds a winding or an unwinding of the line. Means are furthermore present for winding the cutting line on the spool and matching means for matching the position of the portion of insertion on the spool and the corresponding passage towards the outside of the housing, suitable to facilitate the operations of inserting the cutting line in the spool. The special characteristic of the present invention is that the matching means for matching the angular position comprise at least one reversible coupling between an abutment associated to one of said first and second part and a corresponding counter-abutment associated to the other of said first and second part.With reference to  cited above, a grass-cutting head according to the present invention is indicated, in its entirety, with number .This head  comprises a spool  for winding a cutting line (not indicated in the figures for the sake of simplicity) and a housing  for the cutting line; in  a diagram of the direction of exit from the head of the end segments of the line is obtained through two sections of broken incident lines. The cutting head according to the present invention also comprises means for winding the cutting line around the spool , described in greater detail hereunder.The housing  is formed by a first part  and a second part  coupled to each other in such a manner as to allow a reciprocal angular movement around the axis of rotation of the grass-cutting head and, in this embodiment, also a movement of relative translation along this axis of rotation.In particular, in the embodiment under description, the head  comprises an outer casing , which contains most of the spool . The casing  defines, in the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first part  of the housing , whilst the spool  defines the corresponding second part . Practically, casing  and spool  delimit the housing .In particular, in this example of embodiment, the spool  comprises, in its main structural elements, a cylindrical central hub , from which two parallel flanges  and  develop, respectively an upper flange and a lower flange. The upper/lower reference is related to an arrangement of the head  with axis X of rotation orthogonal to the ground and oriented so as to cut grass at the ground. From the lower flange  a body  develops, which is practically in this example a continuation of the hub , passing through a circular aperture  obtained on the lower base  of the casing . It should be noted that the lower base  also acts as a removable lid for the casing (the connection between base  and casing  occurs through a snap coupling, i.e. through elastically deformable tabs A defined on the flanks of the casing and provided with retaining portion for a corresponding undercut seat A defined on the base ) in order to allow the access thereof to the inside in the case of maintenance. Casing and spool are, in this example, preferably coaxial to the axis X.The housing  for the cutting line is practically delimited by the lateral flanks  of the casing , by the hub  and by the flanges  and .As mentioned above, casing  and spool , i.e. said first and second part  and  of the housing , are coupled to each other so that they can translate (in addition to rotating) relatively, i.e. in such a manner that the above mentioned body , projecting outside the casing through the circular aperture , can move along the axis X of rotation (coinciding with the axis of the aperture ), i.e. it is arranged in a slidable manner in the aperture , acting as a guide.On the upper base  of the casing  is preferably present a shaping  for fixing the transmission element (not shown in the figures) for transmitting the rotary motion coming from the motorization of the brush cutting machine.On the upper face A of the upper flange of the spool a first series of teeth  is present, developing according to a circumference coaxial with the axis of the spool. Analogously, on the lower face A of the lower flange  a second series of teeth  is present, developing according to a circumference coaxial with the axis of the spool. This first and second series of teeth  and  are mutually axially and angularly displaced.On the casing , i.e. the first part  of the housing , a toothing is present, suitable to interact alternatively with the first series  and the second series  according to the axial relative position of the casing and of the spool (i.e. of the first and second part  and ), according to a known method. In this example, this toothing comprises a first toothing  obtained on the upper base  of the casing  in the form of radial ribs, which interacts with the first series of teeth , and a second toothing , obtained on the lower base  of the casing, also in the form of radial ribs, suitable to interact with the second series of teeth . These first and second toothing  and  are mutually angularly displaced.The series of teeth  and  with the toothings  and  form, together with elastic means , means for winding the cutting line around the spool . These elastic means  are arranged between the first part  and the second part  and act so that to a relative axial displacement of the first and second part  and  (i.e., in this example, the casing  and the spool ) from a position, wherein the head is in position for cutting (see ) to a position (see ) wherein the head  is ready for receiving or extracting the line in/from the spool (as better described hereunder), corresponds a compression of the elastic means . This compression occurs between a position, wherein these elastic means  intersect the direction Y () of inserting the cutting line towards the spool, to a position wherein the elastic means  are moved away from said direction Y of inserting towards the spool .In particular, the elastic means  are arranged between the spool  and the casing  in such a manner as to contrast a relative movement of the body/spool / and of the casing  so as to bring the body  towards the inside of the casing. In this example, the elastic means  are embodied by an helical spring arranged in a cylindrical pocket  defined at the end by the hub  of the spool  and coaxially to the axis of this latter.The housing  presents, in this example, a pair of passages , radially opposite relative to the axis of rotation of the head. These passages  are embodied by a pair of mutually opposite through holes defined on the lateral flanks  of the casing , delimited by bushings .On the spool  is defined an inserting portion  for inserting the cutting line so that to a rotation of the spool corresponds a winding or an unwinding of the line. In this example, the inserting portion  provides for a perforation passing through the hub  of the spool  according to an orientation radial and orthogonal (i.e. transverse) to the axis X of the spool (i.e. of the head).As it can be noted, this through perforation  is obtained in the portion of hub comprised between the flanges  and  of the spool , in a position outside the pocket  but next to it. In particular, the perforation  and the pocket  are separated by a platform element  forming a wall of the hole and the base of the pocket.In use, the line is blocked on the head due to the effect of two opposite thrusts with direction parallel to the axis X of the head obtained on the line respectively by the spool (by means of the edges of the perforation ) and by the casing (by means of the edges of the passages ) and due to the presence of the elastic means  which make different the axial position of the perforation  on the hub of the spool and of the passages  on the casing.According to the present invention, between the first part  and the second part  (in this example, the casing  and the spool ) a reversible coupling is present (see in particular ) between an abutment  associated to the second part and a corresponding counter-abutment  associated to the first part, whose main function, when coupled, is that of acting as matching means for matching the angular position of the perforation  on the spool  with the opposite passages  defined on the casing  to facilitate the operation of inserting the cutting line in the spool. Practically, when abutment and counter-abutment are coupled, perforation  and passages  are mutually aligned, thus allowing the cutting line to pass throughout easily.The abutment  comprises a ramp A and a subsequent seat B for reversible coupling, on which the corresponding counter-abutment  is able respectively to strip and to couple. Abutment and counter-abutment are structured in the head  in such a manner that to the stripping on the ramp A of the counter-abutment  corresponds a relative axial displacement between the first and the second part  and  (i.e., in this example, between casing  and spool ) from a position, wherein the head is in a use position, to a position, wherein the head is ready to receive or extract the cutting line from the spool.Preferably, the abutment  is a tooth comprising an inclined stripping face constituting the ramp A and an opposite abutment face C for the tooth itself. On the tip of this tooth, between the two inclined (A) and abutment (C) faces, the coupling seat B is defined for the complementary counter-abutment . According to the example described, the seat B is concave and reentries towards the body of the tooth; the complementary counter-abutment  is practically formed by a projection with head A substantially counter-shaped to the seat B.According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the tooth forming the abutment  constitutes a tooth of the second series of teeth  present on the lower face A of the lower flange , whilst the projection forming the counter-abutment  exits from the lower base  of the casing . In particular, all the teeth of the second series  present at least one ramp face as that of the abutment , with an angular orientation substantially concord to that of the ramp of the abutment .Operation of the head is as follows. When the head is in cutting phase, the helical spring  pushes the spool  towards the lower base  of the casing , with the second series of teeth  abutting laterally on the second toothing  present on the same lower base . Casing and spool therefore rotate together, as the casing, through the interaction between second series of teeth and toothing, carries the spool into rotation. The teeth of the second series present a ramp inclined face and an abutment face, and therefore the second toothing , taking as a reference the direction of rotation of the casing during the cutting phase, is suitable to abut against these abutment faces.The cutting line is wound about the hub , between the flanges  and , and presents end segments exiting from the passages  defined on the flanks  of the casing. When it is necessary to elongate these end segments, for example as they are worn, it is sufficient to press the head against the ground, thus pressing the body , which partially reenters inside the casing winning the resistance of the spring . This axial movement towards the inside of the body/spool makes the second series of teeth disengage from the second toothing, whilst the first series of teeth  of the upper flange  of the spool engages with the first toothing  on the upper base  of the casing. The engagement of these latter occurs, thanks to the displacement between series of teeth, after a partial relative rotation casing/spool, such as to unwind a portion of line from the spool towards the outside of the casing through the passages .According to the present invention, if it is necessary to remove the residual line from the spool or insert and wind new line on it, it is necessary to align the passages  on the lateral flanks of the casing with the inserting portion  obtained transversally to the spool . To do this it is sufficient, by acting on the body , to rotate the spool in a direction opposite to that of rotation of the head . The teeth of the second series  meet with their inclined faces the second toothing . The inclination of the teeth causes a compression action of the helical spring  with axial movement of the spool and contemporaneously rotation, thus allowing the teeth of the second series  to overcome the teeth of the second toothing .When the tooth of the second series  acting as abutment  meets the projection constituting the counter-abutment , the same compressive effect of the spring  occurs, with axial movement of the spool. When the head A of the projection of the counter-abutment  enters the seat  B defined on the tip of the tooth acting as abutment , a coupling occurs, contrasting the continuation of the rotation between spool and casing. This coupling can be perceived by the user, who therefore stops the action of rotation. To this coupling position between abutment and counter-abutment corresponds an alignment of the passages  on the casing  with the perforation  on the spool , thus allowing the insertion of the cutting line. Abutment and counter-abutment act therefore as matching means of the angular position between passages  on the casing  with the perforation  on the spool .It should be noted that these angular matching means are inside the head  and therefore they are not subjected to the wear due to the stripping with the ground, to which are instead subjected the reference arrows arranged on the outer body of the spool of the heads of the known type.Advantageously, the direction Y of inserting the cutting line through the passages  towards the spool  intersects the elastic means  (the helical spring) when they are not compressed due to the effect of the axial movement of the spool (i.e. the spool and the casing are reciprocally arranged for a cutting action of the head), whilst it does not intersect these elastic means when they are compressed during coupling between abutment and counter-abutment on the spool. This allows dimensioning adequately the inside of the head (with fixed outer dimensions) maximizing the thickness of the upper base at the coupling portion  for coupling to the transmission of the motorization to which the head must be applied, thus obtained a more strong connection. This advantage is practically due to the fact that there is not the design constraint present in the known heads, due to the fact that the helical spring is always compressed between the direction of inserting the cutting line and base of the casing.It is clearly apparent that according to the present invention many different configurations of the components of the head are possible. With reference to , for example, it is possible to obtain the abutment  on the lower base  of the casing  (i.e. on the first part forming the housing  of the cutting line), preferably on the second toothing  present on this base, and to obtain the counter-abutment  on the lower flange  of the spool  (i.e. on the first part of the housing of the cutting line).Furthermore, according to another embodiment, not shown, it is possible to obtain the abutment on the upper flange (for example of the first series of teeth) and the counter-abutment on the upper base. Furthermore, it is possible to obtain the abutment on the upper base (for example on the first toothing) and the counter-abutment on the upper flange of the spool. In these two latter examples, the elastic means are preferably arranged between the spool and the lower base of the casing.It should be furthermore noted that in general it is sufficient a single abutment and a single counter-abutment to define a correct correspondence of the angular position of one or more inserting portions on the spool with corresponding one or more passages towards the outside of the housing of the cutting line. However, it is clearly apparent that, depending upon the number of cutting lines exiting from the housing defined by the casing and by the spool according to a given angular pitch (i.e. according to the numerous passages and inserting portions present on the casing and on the spool), it could be convenient to have more than one abutment (and at least one corresponding counter-abutment) to limit the rotation of the spool by the user for angles equal to the pitch between the lines and not for (at the maximum) a whole round angle (2π radiants) to find the exact match.In the example described above the case is cited of a spool with two opposite abutments defined on two opposite teeth of a series of four teeth defined on the lower flange. As mentioned above, this configuration can be used for example in the case of a single cutting line with two cutting ends exiting from the casing. In this case, if a single counter-abutment is used, a rotation will be necessary of (maximum) π radiants, whilst if two opposite counter-abutments are used, a rotation will be necessary of (maximum) π/2 radiants to find the correct match.shows for example the case of a spool with three abutments  defined on three teeth, angularly displaced by π/3 radiants, of a series 28 of six defined on the lower flange  of the spool . This configuration can be used for example in the case of three cutting lines with two cutting ends exiting from the casing or three cutting lines, each with a cutting end. In this case the number of abutments is indifferently 1, 2, or 3 (adequately displaced), as there is, each π/3 radiants, a coupling, which causes the correct relative position spool/casing.shows the case of a spool with four abutments , opposite to each other in pair, defined on each tooth  of a series defined on the lower flange  of the spool . This configuration can be used for example in the case of four cutting lines, each with a single cutting end exiting from the casing, or two cutting lines, each with two cutting ends exiting from the casing. Also in this case the number of abutments is indifferently 1 to 4, as there is, each π/2 radiants, a coupling, which causes the correct relative position spool/casing.shows for example the case of a spool  with three abutments  defined on three teeth, angularly displaced by π/3 radiants, of a series 28 of three defined on the lower flange . This configuration can be used for example in the case of a single cutting line with two cutting ends exiting from the casing or three cutting lines, each with two cutting ends. Also in this case the number of abutments is indifferent, as there is, each π/3 radiants, a coupling, which causes the correct relative position spool/casing.It should be furthermore noted that in the example described above, corresponding to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, reference has been made to a structure, wherein the first part and the second part of the housing of the cutting line of a head according to the invention are respectively formed by the casing and by the spool. It is clear that other structures of the head can use a first and a second part of the housing constituted by other components of the head, as described for example in the patent application WO2008053508.It is understood that what is illustrated purely represents possible non-limiting embodiments of the invention, which may vary in forms and arrangements without departing from the scope of the concept on which the invention is based. Any reference numbers in the appended claims are provided for the sole purpose of facilitating the reading thereof in the light of the description hereinbefore and the accompanying drawings and do not in any way limit the scope of protection of the present invention."

                "The present invention is a divisional application of co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 12/281,442, filed Sep. 2, 2008. The invention described and claimed hereinbelow is also described in German Patent Application DE 10 2006 052 608.5 filed on Nov. 9, 2006. These German Patent Applications, whose subject matter is incorporated here by reference, provides the basis for a claim of priority of invention under 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d).The present invention is based on a hand-held jigsaw.For example, the publications US 2005/0060896 A1 and US 2005/0257985 A1 have disclosed jigsaws that are referred to as “scrolling jigsaws” and in which the saw blade is situated so that in addition to executing the stroke motion, it can be rotated manually independently of the sawing motion. This additional function facilitates the sawing of sinuous cuts.Without additional guidance-assisting elements, sawing precisely along a predetermined contour with a jigsaw requires a large amount of practice. This task is additionally complicated by the exertion of transverse forces that cause the saw blade to go astray. Providing laterally supporting assistance systems or various navigation aids (e.g. lasers) reduces these problems, but does not eliminated them.The invention is based on a hand-held jigsaw, in particular a scrolling jigsaw.According to the invention, control means are provided that make it possible to automate a tracking of a saw blade and/or of the hand-held jigsaw along layout lines. In this context, a “control means” is understood in particular to be a means that permits a required orientation of the saw blade and/or the hand-held jigsaw and/or a component of the hand-held jigsaw such as a glide element to be detected and/or adapted to the orientation. This control means can be a detection unit such as a sensor system embodied in the form of a sensor and/or an actuator system embodied in the form of an actuating unit such as a servo motor and/or a step motor and/or a piezoelectric actuator. Alternatively, it would also be conceivable to use a DC motor. The term “tracking” here defines an orientation along a predetermined path that is preferably indicated by means of a marking. This marking can be a layout line such as a previously drawn pencil line and/or another marking deemed suitable by a person skilled in the art, such as an indentation and/or some other form of profiling.The system is used to assist an operator and therefore to facilitate the sawing procedure. Taking advantage of the existing degree of freedom of the saw blade in the form of the already implemented rotation axis, the hand-held jigsaw is equipped with a special sensor system for detecting a previously drawn line or layout line and a corresponding actuator system for automatically adjusting the saw blade angle from an angle range of a pivot angle. The rotation axis here is defined by a normal that extends through a center point of a plane defined by a thickness and a width of the saw blade. Alternatively, the rotation axis of the saw blade can also be situated other than at its center point. In this case, the pivot angle represents the angle by which the saw blade can be maximally adjusted around its longitudinal axis in relation to a longitudinal axis of the glide element and/or another guidance component deemed suitable by a person skilled in the art, e.g. a chassis. This pivot angle is preferably an angle of between 0° and 90°. By contrast, the saw blade angle of the saw blade is the angle that is actually set between the lateral span of the saw blade and the longitudinal axis of the glide element or a guidance component. By means of a saw blade motion that is overlaid with a hand-guided movement of the operator, it is possible to more precisely track a previously drawn contour. Straight cuts can also be implemented without additional guides.This produces a significantly improved work result while simultaneously simplifying operation.It is also advantageous if it is possible to switch off means that are provided for automating a tracking of the saw blade and/or the hand-held jigsaw along layout lines. This makes it possible to create a hand-held jigsaw that can be used in a particularly flexible fashion.If a hand-held jigsaw has a pivotable saw blade that can be driven by the control means, then a tracking of the previously drawn line by the saw blade can occur in an advantageous, structurally simple fashion. The term “pivotable” here is particularly understood to mean a turning and/or rotation of the saw blade in an axis that preferably extends parallel to a longitudinal span of the saw blade. In this connection, the turning can be achieved by clamping the saw blade into a tool socket and/or through some other exertion of force on the saw blade.The invention is also based on a hand-held jigsaw, in particular a scrolling jigsaw.According to the invention, a sensor is provided for detecting a layout line provided on a workpiece. The term “sensor” is understood in particular here to mean a camera unit and/or a contrast sensor unit and/or an eddy current sensor unit. This makes it possible to achieve a detection of a desired cutting direction in a particularly advantageous, inexpensive, structurally simple fashion.Also according to the invention, optical mouse sensors are provided for determining a speed and/or a movement direction. The term “optical mouse sensor” is understood here to mean a sensor that uses optical means such as a light-emitting diode or laser diode to illuminate a supporting surface, evaluates a light reflected against the supporting surface, calculates a speed based on the change of a physical surface of the supporting surface, and from this, calculates the movement data in the x and/or y direction. Alternatively, the movement direction and/or the advancing speed can also be determined by means of a running wheel with an angular displacement transducer, e.g. a rolling element with corresponding photoelectric beam, detectors that detect a movement in at least two directions such as an x direction and a y direction. In addition, means that are used to compare individual camera images can also be provided to determine the advancing speed. The use of optical mouse sensors makes it possible for a rugged sensor system for determining the speed and/or a movement direction to be produced in a particularly simple and inexpensive fashion.It is also advantageous if an actuator with a regulator is provided. An “actuator with a regulator” is understood here to be a unit that processes data from a detection unit, particularly in a control loop, and/or reacts to and/or transmits generated control signals. This unit is preferably embodied in the form of a servo motor and/or a step motor and/or a piezoelectric actuator and/or a DC motor with a regulator unit. It is thus possible for a control loop for precisely tracking a predetermined cutting line to be implemented in a structurally simple and inexpensive fashion.According to the invention, a display element is produced, which is provided to display a recommended advancing direction. A “display element” is understood here to mean an element that optically, acoustically, and/or tactilely informs the operator of the path detected by a sensor or of a course of the layout line. The display element here can be composed of LEDs and/or a display and/or another data unit deemed suitable by a person skilled in the art. This makes it advantageously possible for an operator to receive information relating to a desired movement direction, regardless of whether the operator is able to see the saw blade. This makes it possible for an operator to stay within an optimal working region that represents an angular range of the possible saw blade angle.is a perspective side view of a hand-held jigsaw  according to the invention, embodied in the form of a scrolling jigsaw. The hand-held jigsaw  includes a machine housing , a main handle  integrated into the machine housing , and a tool socket  containing a tool in the form of a rotatably supported saw blade . A glide element or glide shoe  in the form of a base plate is situated on a side  oriented toward the work piece  to be machined. This glide shoe  permits the hand-held jigsaw  to advantageously glide on the work piece . On the side  oriented away from the saw blade , in a region that can be associated with the main handle , a guide knob is provided, which is used for an at least manual guidance of the hand-held jigsaw . The machine housing  also contains a motor that is not shown in detail. On the main handle , an actuation switch  is provided, which can be used to switch the hand-held jigsaw  on and off. In a side region  of the machine housing , an adjusting switch  is also provided, which can be used to adjust the glide shoe  in relation to a main span  of the saw blade .The hand-held jigsaw  includes control means ,  that enable an automation of a tracking of the saw blade  along the layout line . The control means  is situated in a part  of the machine housing  spaced apart from the main handle  in the axial direction . The control means  includes a sensor  for detecting or optically scanning a marking or layout line  in the form of a normal pencil line  provided on the work piece . The sensor  is composed of a camera unit  that preferably includes a low-cost camera and that is associated with a processor unit . In principle, the sensor  could also be a contrast sensor unit  and/or eddy current sensor unit  associated with a respective processor unit . For an optimal detection of the previously drawn line , it would also be conceivable for the eddy current sensor  to be situated in the glide shoe .A monitoring region  of the sensor  and of the camera unit  extends toward the work piece  in the same direction as the main span  of the saw blade  and covers a 360° angular range around the saw blade . The monitoring region  of the camera unit  represents the region in which the saw blade  functions in an operating mode, preferably a sawing procedure of a work piece . Around the saw blade , the glide shoe  has a semicircular opening  in which the saw blade  is centrally situated. In the direction of an advancing direction  and in the direction of the monitoring region , the opening  has a rectangular viewing window . The glide shoe  also has a reference mark  that represents the intersecting point of an edge  of the glide shoe  with a longitudinal axis  of the glide shoe  (see ).shows an alternative embodiment of the glide shoe . In this case, the central opening  widens out in a V-shape to form a viewing region .shows another alternative embodiment of the glide shoe  with a circular opening . In this case, the glide shoe  is closed in the monitoring region  and is embodied as transparent, e.g. is composed of Plexiglas, in order to make it possible to monitor the layout line  on the work piece  (see ).In addition, the machine housing  of the handheld jigsaw  contains a compact actuator system  that is able to adjust the saw blade  around a rotation axis  in an automated fashion. The control means  is provided for this purpose. For the tracking of the rotatable saw blade , the saw blade is driven in rotary fashion by the control means . The control means  represents an actuator unit , embodied in the form of an actuator with a regulator  in the form of a step motor by means of which it is possible to adjust a saw blade angle  of a saw blade . The control means  and the step motor can also be situated in a space-saving fashion as an alternative to the guide knob . In this case, the saw blade angle  is an angle □ from the angular range of a pivot angle  that is actually set between the width span  of the saw blade  and the longitudinal axis  of the glide shoe . The pivot angle  represents the angle □by which the saw blade  can be moved around its longitudinal axis, which extends parallel to the main span direction  of the saw blade , in relation to a longitudinal axis  of the glide shoe  (see ).With the aid of the control means , , namely the sensor  and the actuator unit , it is possible to implement a control loop in order to achieve the most exact possible tracking of the predetermined line or layout line . The exceptional feature in this case lies on the one hand in the fact that an analog image processing is used to detect the layout line  and on the other hand, lies in the automation of the system. It is consequently possible to execute clean, precise cuts by hand and to actively prevent a deviation of the saw blade .An operating sequence will be described in greater detail below.The sensor  in the form of a camera unit  detects individual points  of the previously drawn line or layout line . In this case, in order to detect the layout line , the sensor  uses an analog image processing that uses a division of the monitoring region  into individual search lines  without digital image processing. In the analog image processing, the use of the camera unit  is particularly advantageous since it does not require calculation-intensive digital image processing.The collected sensor information and the data associated with the detected points  are then transmitted by the sensor  to the processor unit , which processes the detected points  further and based on them, interpolates and adapts an actual path curve  (spline). The processor unit  can be a microcontroller or another processing unit deemed suitable by a person skilled in the art.The processing unit  calculates and generates control signals and transmits control signals to the actuator unit  for an adjustment of the saw blade angle . By means of an actuating element with a regulator  in the form of a step motor, the actuator unit  then correspondingly adapts the saw blade angle , i.e. the angle □ around the longitudinal axis parallel to the main span direction  of the saw blade , as a function of the overlaid user guidance by means of the guide knob  of the hand-held jigsaw .At the same time, the use of the sensor  and the camera unit  also offers the possibility of measuring additional reference marks  by means of the glide shoe . Furthermore, the sensor  can be used for detecting the set saw blade angle  and for determining the rotation angle of the saw blade . This makes it possible to eliminate additional cost-intensive sensors that unnecessarily take up space.An additional, alternative embodiment is the integration of a detection of an advancing speed. To this end, optical mouse sensors  are situated in the glide shoe  on a side  oriented toward the work piece  and determine the speed and a movement direction, preferably in the x and/or y direction (see ).shows another possibility for detecting the advancing speed. In this case, a simple running wheel with an angular displacement transducer  is provided, e.g. a rolling element  with corresponding photoelectric beam detectors . In principle, other approaches are also conceivable, for example the comparison of individual camera images by means of the processor unit . Within certain limits, the system can also be implemented without a speed measurement.When the hand-held jigsaw  is used, i.e. during a sawing process, an operator guides the hand-held jigsaw  manually by means of the main handle  and guide knob ; the operator must roughly predetermine the cutting direction. The system composed of the control means , , i.e. of the sensor  and actuator unit , is conceived only for the fine regulation that compensates for irregularities in the saw blade path and/or user guidance.This system is understood solely as an assisting system, i.e. if no layout line  can be detected (end of a line, multiple lines), the system gives a warning by means of an acoustic and/or optical unit , stabilizes the current saw blade angle , and leaves the control up to the operator, as in conventional jigsaws. No active intervention occurs. If so desired, the system, which can be associated with one or more means and which permits automation of a tracking of the saw blade  and/or the hand-held jigsaw  along layout lines , can be switched off at any time, even preferably manually by the operator. The system advantageously includes the actuator system , at least one or speed-detecting sensor such as the optical mouse sensor , the control means  in the form of the sensor  and the camera unit , the control means  in the form of the actuating unit , and the actuator with a regulator . For the switching off, a switch  is provided in the region of the main handle  on the machine housing .As shown in , a display element , e.g. in the form of LEDs  and/or a display , is situated on a side  of the machine housing  or main handle  oriented toward the operator, in the operator's field of view. This display element  is provided to display a recommended advancing direction , for example symbolized by means of an arrow symbol  composed of light-emitting diodes or LEDs . The operator is thus shown the direction in which the saw movement must be corrected. Consequently, the display element  makes it possible for the operator to stay within an optimum working region that represents an angular range of the possible saw blade angle .In another embodiment of the invention, in order to improve visibility, a blower  is provided, which is able to remove or suck away machining residue generated by the sawing process.On the whole, this makes it possible to significantly simplify the guidance of the hand-held jigsaw  while achieving a simultaneously improved sawing result. Another advantage of this system lies in the fact that the often poor visibility of the sawing location now plays only a subordinate role since the fine guidance is performed by the system anyway."

                "This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-150992 filed on Jul. 1, 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.1. Technical FieldThe present disclosure relates to an engraving needle holder which mounts an engraving needle to a needle bar provided in a sewing machine and a sewing machine provided with the engraving needle holder.2. Related ArtThere has conventionally been provided a multineedle embroidery sewing machine which can continuously execute embroidery sewing with the use of multicolor embroidery threads, for example. The embroidery sewing machine of this type is provided with a needle bar case which is mounted on a distal end of an arm and has, for example, six needle bars. One of the needle bars is selectively coupled to a needle bar driving mechanism thereby to be vertically driven. The embroidery sewing machine is also provided with a transfer mechanism which transfers an embroidery frame holding a workpiece cloth. A control device of the embroidery sewing machine controls the needle bar driving mechanism and other driving mechanisms while moving the embroidery frame holding the workpiece cloth in two or X and Y directions by the transfer mechanism based on pattern data indicative of a needle location per stitch (an amount of movement of the workpiece cloth), color change and the like, thereby executing a multi-color embroidery sewing operation.The embroidery sewing machine of this type includes one provided with a boring device which makes a cut or bores a hole in the workpiece cloth. The boring device comprises a mount, a holder, a boring knife, a presser and a spring. The boring knife has a lower end formed with a blade portion. A user attaches the boring device to a specific needle bar and starts the operation of the embroidery sewing machine. As a result, eyelet embroidery is executable in which embroidery is made around a cut while the cut or the hole is being formed in the workpiece cloth. Furthermore, the embroidery sewing machine includes a type in which the boring knife is interchangeable with a sewing needle. The needle bar has a lower end formed with an insertion hole into which an upper end of the needle is inserted so that the needle is attached to the needle bar. The upper end of the boring knife has the same configuration as the upper end of the needle. Thus, the upper end of the boring knife is inserted into the insertion hole such that the boring knife is attached to the needle bar.On the other hand, a plurality of dents (embossment) or small holes has recently been formed in a sheet-like workpiece such as paper in a handicraft field, so that various types of patterns have been expressed using the dents or small holes. For example, a parchment craft has been becoming popular in which a plurality of dents or small holes is formed in thick tracing paper, which is formed into a decor. In this case, only the dents become cloudy when formed in the tracing paper. Patterns are made by utilizing the cloudy dents.The inventors contemplated using a multineedle sewing machine as an apparatus which executes an engraving process to form the aforesaid dents or small holes by attaching an engraving needle for parchment craft, instead of the sewing needle. In this case, a user attaches to a transfer mechanism a holder to fixedly hold the sheet-like workpiece such as tracing paper, instead of an embroidery frame holding workpiece cloth. The user then vertically moves the needle bar with the attached engraving needle while the holder holding the workpiece is transferred by the transfer mechanism based on previously generated data for engraving process, whereby a predetermined engraving process is applied to the surface of the workpiece. Thus, various patterns each comprising a plurality of engraved marks (dents) or small holes would be considered to be made.The construction that the engraving needle is detachably attachable to the needle bar is required when the engraving process such as parchment craft or the like is executed by utilizing drive of the needle bar provided in the sewing machine. Furthermore, a depth of engraving in the workpiece changes depending upon a mounting height position of the engraving needle attached to the needle bar. More specifically, the size of the engraved marks (dents) or small holes to be formed on the workpiece changes. Accordingly, it has been sought that the mounting height position of the engraving needle attached to the needle bar should be easily adjustable by the user.In this case, the boring knife mounting structure can be considered to be applied to the mounting of the engraving needle. However, a needle clamp is attached to the needle to fix the needle attached to the lower end of the needle bar. The needle clamp needs to be detached when the boring device is to be mounted. Attachment and detachment of the needle clamp take a lot of trouble. Furthermore, adjustment of the mounting height position of the boring knife to be attached to the needle bar is not considered, and the mounting height position of the boring knife cannot substantially be adjusted.Therefore, an object of the disclosure is to provide an engraving needle holder which can easily mount the engraving needle to the needle bar of the sewing machine and which can easily adjust the mounting height position of the engraving needle to be mounted, and to provide a sewing machine with the engraving needle holding device.The present disclosure provides an engraving needle holder which mounts an engraving needle to a needle bar when an engraving process is executed for a workpiece by moving the engraving needle upward and downward by making use of drive of the needle bar provided on a sewing machine, the engraving needle holder comprising a mounted part which is mountable to a fixing part of a lower end of the needle bar into which a handle of the needle is inserted to be fixed, with the needle being removed; a supporting member provided at a lower end side of the mounting part so that a base of the engraving needle is mounted thereto so as to be positionally adjustable; and an adjusting mechanism which adjusts a mounting height position of the engraving needle relative to the supporting member.The disclosure also provides a sewing machine comprising a needle bar; and an engraving needle holder which mounts an engraving needle to the needle bar when the engraving needle is moved upward and downward by making use of drive of the needle bar so that an engraving process is executed for a workpiece, the engraving needle holder including a mounted part which is mountable to a fixing part of a lower end of the needle bar into which a handle of the needle is inserted to be fixed, with the needle being removed; a supporting member provided at a lower end side of the mounting part so that a base of the engraving needle is mounted thereto so as to be positionally adjustable; and an adjusting mechanism which adjusts a mounting height position of the engraving needle relative to the supporting member.A first embodiment will be described with reference to . A multineedle sewing machine is provided with an engraving needle holder in the embodiment. Referring to , the construction of a multineedle embroidery sewing machine is shown.

The support base  is formed into substantially a U-shape and has two legs extending forward from right and left portions thereof respectively and an open front as viewed from above. The support base  further has a cylinder bed  which is formed integrally therewith and extends forward from the central rear thereof. A needle plate  having a needle hole is detachably mounted on an upper part of the distal end of the cylinder bed . A thread hook is provided in the cylinder bed  although not shown.A spool device on which, for example, six thread spools are settable is mounted on an upper rear of the arm  although not shown. An operation panel is provided on the right of the arm  although not shown. On the operation panel are provided a plurality of operation switches  which are operated by the user or operator for operation of various instructions, selection and input and a liquid crystal display (LCD)  as shown in .A needle bar case  is mounted on a distal end of the arm  so as to be movable in the right-left direction (the X direction) as shown in . The needle bar case  is formed into the shape of a generally rectangular box that is thin in the front-back direction as shown in . A plurality of, for example, six needle bars  which are lined up in the right-left direction are movable upward and downward. Each needle bar  is normally urged upward by a coil spring that is not shown thereby to be held at a needle-up position as shown in .The needle bars  have lower ends protruding below the needle bar case  respectively. Needles  for embroidery sewing are detachably or replaceably mounted to the lower ends of the needle bars  respectively. Needle clamps are fixed to the lower ends of the needle bars  respectively as shown in . Upper handles of the needles  are adapted to be attached to the respective needle clamps . The needle clamps serve as fixing parts. The needle clamps have respective holes into which the handles of the needles  are inserted from below although the holes are not shown in the drawings. Each handle has a cylindrical shape with a flat part or is formed into a D-cut shape. The needle clamps have the holes formed into such a D-cut shape that the handles of the needle bars  are fittable thereinto, respectively. The holes of the needle clamps include upper portions provided with stoppers respectively. The handles of the needles  have upper ends which are inserted into the holes until abutting against the stoppers , whereby vertical mounting height positions of the needle bars  are determined, respectively. The needle clamps have front portions provided with setscrews  for fixing the handles of the needles , respectively. The setscrews  have respective hexagon sockets. The user uses a tool such as a hex key to tighten or loosen the hexagon sockets, whereby the needles  can be attached to and detached from the needle bars  respectively.The six needle bars  are assigned with needle bar numbers sequentially from right to left. The needle bar numbers will hereinafter be used when specific one or more needle bars are to be designated, and otherwise, reference numeral “” will be used. In this case, as shown in , an engraving needle holder  provided with an engraving needle , instead of the needle  is attached to the leftmost needle bar No. . The engraving needle holder  will be described in detail later.Presser feet  are mounted on lower portions of the needle bars  so as to be movable upward and downward in synchronization with the upward and downward movement of the needle bars  respectively. The presser foot  is detached from the needle bar No.  since the engraving needle holder  is to be attached to the needle bar No. . Furthermore, six thread take-up levers are also mounted on an upper portion of the needle bar case  so as to correspond to the needle bars  respectively although not shown in detail. The needle bar case  has six slits  which are formed in the front thereof so as to extend vertically. The thread take-up levers have distal ends which are inserted through the slits  to protrude to the front side, respectively. The thread take-up levers are configured to be moved upward and downward (swung) in synchronization with the upward and downward movement of the needle bars  respectively.The needle bar case  includes an upper cover  which is formed integrally therewith and extends obliquely rearward from an upper end thereof as shown in . Six thread tensioners (only mounting holes therefor are shown) and six thread guides  are located on an upper end of the upper cover . As the result of the above-described construction, needle threads for embroidery sewing are drawn from respective thread spools set on a spool device and passed through respective thread guides , the thread tensioners, the thread take-up levers and the like sequentially. The needle threads are finally passed through the eyes of the needles  respectively, whereupon the embroidery sewing is executable. In this case, when different colors of needle threads are supplied to five needles  of needle bar Nos.  to , an embroidery sewing operation can continuously be carried out while the threads are automatically changed.A sewing machine motor  (only shown in ) is provided in the pillar  although not shown in detail in the drawings. In the arm  are provided a main shaft  driven by the sewing machine motor , a needle bar driving mechanism which is driven by rotation of the main shaft  thereby to move the needle bars  and the like upward and downward, a needle bar selecting mechanism which moves the needle bar case  in the X direction to select one of the needle bars , and the like, as well known in the art. Additionally, the thread hook is also driven by rotation of the main shaft in synchronization with the upward and downward movement of the needle bar .The needle bar driving mechanism includes an upward and downward moving member which is selectively engaged with the needle bar clamp (not shown) provided on each needle bar . The needle bar selecting mechanism is driven by a needle bar selecting motor  (shown only in ) to transfer the needle bar case  in the X direction so that any one of the needle bars  located right above the needle hole is engaged with the upward and downward moving member. Additionally, the needle bars  are adapted to be reciprocally moved in the upward and downward directions upon one turn of the main shaft.The transfer mechanism  (see ) includes a carriage  located on the upper portion of the cylinder bed , as shown in . To the carriage  are detachably coupled an embroidery frame  (see ) holding a workpiece on which embroidery is to be sewn or a engraving support  (see ) holding the sheet-like workpiece W such as tracing paper for the engraving process as will be described later. A plurality of types of embroidery frames  holding the workpiece and differing in the size or shape is provided as accessories although not shown in detail.The carriage  includes a Y-direction carriage , an X-direction carriage  mounted on the Y-direction carriage  and a frame holder  (shown only in ) mounted on the X-direction carriage  as shown in . The aforesaid transfer mechanism  includes a Y-direction drive mechanism which is provided in the support base  to move the Y-direction carriage  in the Y direction (the front-back direction) and an X-direction drive mechanism which is provided in the Y-direction carriage  to move the X-direction carriage  and the frame holder  in the X-direction (right-left direction). The embroidery frame  or an engraving support  is held by the frame holder  and is transferred in predetermined two directions or the X and Y directions by the transfer mechanism .The Y-direction carriage  is formed into the shape of a horizontally long (narrow) box and extends in the right-left direction (the X direction) so as to bridge between the right and left legs . In this case, the legs of the support base  are formed with respective guide grooves  extending in the front-back direction (the Y direction) as shown in . The Y-direction drive mechanism includes two moving members which extend vertically through the guide grooves  and are provided so as to be movable in the Y-direction (the front-back direction) along the guide grooves , respectively, although not shown in the drawings. The Y-direction carriage  has right and left ends connected to upper ends of the moving members respectively.The Y-direction drive mechanism includes a Y-direction drive motor  (see ) comprising a stepping motor and a linear moving mechanism comprising a timing pulley and a timing belt. The moving member is moved by the linear moving mechanism driven by the Y-direction drive motor serving as a drive source, whereby the Y-direction carriage  is moved in the Y direction.The X-direction carriage  is formed into the shape of a horizontally long plate having a part thereof protruding forward from the lower front of the Y-direction carriage  as shown in . The X-direction carriage  is supported by the Y-direction carriage  so as to be slidable in the X direction (the right-left direction). The X-direction drive mechanism provided in the Y-direction carriage  includes an X-direction drive motor  (see ) comprising a stepping motor and a linear moving mechanism comprising a timing pulley and a timing belt. The X-direction drive mechanism moves the X-direction carriage  in the X direction (right-left direction).The following describes the frame holder  mounted on the X-direction carriage , the embroidery frame  and the engraving support  latter both detachably attached to the frame holder . Firstly, the embroidery frame  will be described with reference to . The embroidery frame  includes a rounded rectangular inner frame , an outer frame  detachably fitted with the outer periphery of the inner frame  and a pair of connecting portions  mounted on right and left ends of the inner frame . The workpiece cloth serving as the workpiece is held between the inner and outer frames  and  so as to be held in a stretched state inside the inner frame  although not shown in the drawings.The paired connecting portions  have rotational symmetry through 180 degrees in a plan view. The connecting portions  are formed with engagement grooves and engagement holes for attachment to the frame holder  respectively. A plurality of types of embroidery frames  differing in the size and shape (embroidery area) from one another are prepared and selectively used according to a size of embroidery pattern, as described above. Furthermore, the width L or the dimension between the outer edges of the connecting portions  is set so as to differ from one embroidery frame to another according to the type of the connecting portion . The width of the embroidery frame  is detected by a detection unit which will be described later, whereby the type of the embroidery frame  attached to the frame holder  is detected.  shows an embroidery frame  having a largest width L. Additionally, detection is also executed by the aforesaid detection unit when the engraving support  is attached to the frame holder  as will be described later.The engraving support  will now be described. The engraving support  includes a rectangular plate-shaped holding portion  having rounded corners and a pair of connecting members  attached to right and left ends of the holding portion  respectively, as shown in .

Each connecting portion  is formed with an engagement groove and an engagement hole for attachment to the frame holder . The horizontal width L of the engraving support  is set so as to differ from the width L of each type of embroidery frame  as described above. Additionally, a plurality of types of engraving supports  may be provided according to the size, shape, thickness or the like of the engraved workpiece W.The frame holder  to which the embroidery frame  or the engraving support  is attached or connected will be described as follows. The frame holder  is fixedly mounted on an upper surface of the X-direction carriage  as shown in . The frame holder  includes a fixedly mounted fixed arm  and a movable arm  which is mounted on the frame holder  so as to be displaceable relative to the frame holder . The position of the movable arm  changed in the right-left direction by the user according to the types of the embroidery frame  and the engraving support , that is, the width L or L.The frame holder  formed into the shape of a plate extending in the X direction includes a main part having a right end further having an upper surface on which the fixed arm  is mounted so as to be laid on the upper surface. The fixed arm  has a right arm bent substantially at a right angle and extending forward. The right arm has an upper surface with a distal end on which an engagement pin  is provided, and a leaf spring  is mounted so as to be located in the rear of the engagement pin . The leaf spring  is provided for holding the connecting portion . The engagement pin  is engaged with the engagement groove of the connecting portion  of the embroidery frame  or the engagement groove of the connecting portion  of the engraving support .The movable arm  is formed so as to be bilaterally symmetric with the right arm and has a proximal or rear end mounted on the left upper surface of the main part of the frame holder  so as to overlap the surface. The movable arm  has an upper surface provided with an engagement pin  located on a distal end thereof. The upper surface of the movable arm  further has a leaf spring  which is located in the rear of the second engagement pin  and provided for holding the connecting portion  or . The engagement pin  is engaged with an engagement groove of the connecting portion  of the embroidery frame  or an engagement groove of the connecting portion  of the engraving support .The movable arm  has a proximal end formed with an elongate guide groove which is elongate in the right-left direction. A guide pin  is mounted on the upper surface of the main part of the frame holder . The guide pin  is engaged with the guide groove . As a result, the movable arm  is slidable in the right-left direction relative to the main part of the frame holder . Furthermore, the main part of the frame holder  is provided with a positioning and fixing mechanism (not shown) which selectively fixes the movable arm  at one of a plurality of predetermined positions. When the user operates the positioning and fixing mechanism, the position of the movable arm  in the right-left direction is changeable.As the result of the above-described construction, the user attaches the embroidery frame  or the engraving support  to the frame holder  while the movable arm  is fixed to a suitable position according to the type of the embroidery frame  or the engraving support  to be attached, that is, the width L, L. In attachment of the embroidery frame , the connecting portions  of the embroidery frame  are inserted between the movable arm  and the leaf spring  and between the right arm  and the leaf spring  from the front respectively as exemplified in . The engagement hole of the connecting portion  is then engaged with the engagement pin  of the right arm , and the engagement groove of the connecting portion  is engaged with the engagement pin  of the right arm . As a result, the embroidery frame  is held by the frame holder  and moved in the X or Y direction by the transfer mechanism . The engraving support  can also be attached to the frame holder  in the same manner as described above.A frame type sensor  is mounted on the X-direction carriage  for detecting the embroidery frame  or the engraving support  attached to the frame holder  based on a detected position of the movable arm , as shown in . The frame type sensor  comprises a rotary potentiometer, for example, and has a detecting element which abuts a detected portion comprising an inclined surface provided on the movable arm , for example. The frame type sensor  changes a resistance value and accordingly an output voltage value according to variations in a rotational angle of the detecting element depending upon the position of the movable arm  with respect to the right-left direction.An output signal generated by the frame type sensor  is supplied to a control circuit  which will be described later, as shown in . The control circuit  then determines or detects the frame type between the embroidery frame  and the engraving support . Accordingly, the frame type sensor , the control circuit  and the like constitute a detection unit which detects whether the engraving support  has been attached to the transfer mechanism .In the embodiment, the multineedle embroidery sewing machine  can execute a normal embroidery sewing operation with the use of a workpiece cloth and six-color embroidery threads. The multineedle embroidery sewing machine  can further execute an engraving operation in which the engraving needle  is struck against the surface of the engraving workpiece W such as thick tracing paper in dots while the engraving support  is transferred in the X or Y direction by the transfer mechanism , whereby a desired photograph, illustration or character is engraved on the workpiece W. In execution of the engraving operation, as shown in , the engraving needle holder  holding the engraving needle  is attached to the needle bar No. , instead of the needle  as described above.The engraving needle holder  includes a mounted part  made of a metal and formed into a vertically long rounded bar shape (cylindrical shape) and a horizontally long rectangular block-like supporting member  extending leftward from a lower end of the mounted part  as shown in . The mounted part  and the supporting member  are formed integrally with each other. The mounted part  has an upper surface having the same thickness and the same shape as the handle of the upper portion of the needle . The mounted part  includes a D-cut portion which is located at the rear side and formed into a D-cut shape which includes a flat portion in part of the circumferential surface. The user then inserts the mounted part  of the engraving needle holder  into the needle clamp of the lower end of the needle bar  from below with the needle  being removed. On this occasion, the mounted part  is inserted until an upper end thereof abuts the stopper , whereupon the engraving needle holder  is vertically positioned relative to the needle bar .The engraving needle holder  can be mounted when the user then tightens up the setscrew . In this case, the aforementioned D-shaped cut portion positions the engraving needle holder  relative to the needle bar . When it is assumed that the mounted part  is a completely round bar (cylindrical shape), there is a possibility that oscillation or the like resulting from the engraving operation may rotate the engraving needle holder  relative to the needle bar . Upon rotation of the engraving needle holder , the location of engraving by the engraving needle  would be displaced such that an engraved pattern formed by the engraving operation would be collapsed. In order that such a problem may be overcome, the engraving needle holder  is positioned relative to the needle bar  by the D-cut portion to be fixed in position. The D-cut portion thus serves as a positioning unit.The supporting member  has an insertion hole located at a left portion thereof and extending vertically therethrough. The supporting member  also has a screw hole which is formed therethrough so as to extend from the front toward the rear thereby to reach the insertion hole . A hexagon socket setscrew  is engaged with the screw hole . The setscrew  has the same size as the setscrew  for fixing the needle  or the mounted portion .The engraving needle  for parchment craft is made of a metal and formed into a needle shape (round bar shape) having a spherical portion at a distal end thereof. The engraving needle  is inserted into the insertion hole of the supporting member  from below thereby to be supported so that a vertical mounting height position of the engraving needle  as shown by arrow A in  is adjustable. The vertical mounting height position will hereinafter be abbreviated as “height position.” The setscrew  is tightened up after having been heightwise-positioned relative to the supporting member , whereupon the engraving needle  is attached. In this case, an upper part of the engraving needle  is provided with a plurality of reference lines (four in the embodiment) serving as indexes of the height position. The reference lines are arranged longitudinally at intervals of 0.2 mm. When viewing the reference lines exposed above the supporting member , the user can adjust the height position of the engraving needle  at the intervals of 0.2 mm. The above-described supporting member , the screw hole , the setscrew  and the like constitute an adjusting mechanism. The number of reference lines provided on the engraving needle  and the interval between the reference lines should not be limited to the foregoing ones.Since the setscrews  and  have the common size as described above, the user can tighten and loosen both setscrews with a single tool such as a hex key, which can improve the usability of the engraving needle holder . Additionally, needle bar Nos.  to  are used for the embroidery sewing when the engraving needle holder  is attached to the needle bar No. .The distal or lower end of the engraving needle  includes the spherical portion that is suitable for the engraving process such as the parchment craft. The engraving needle  is designed so as to abut the surface of the workpiece W held by the engraving support  when the needle bar  occupies a lowermost position (a bottom dead point). Accordingly, the engraving needle  is shorter than the sewing needle . The user can change the height position of the engraving needle  relative to the needle bar  thereby to change a depth of engraving or the degree of an engraved trace (the dent) formed on the surface of the workpiece W. As a result, the user can make a floral pattern on the thick tracing paper serving as the workpiece W with the engraving needle  as shown in . The user can obtain a smaller engraved trace  (having a diameter of approximately 1 mm) when the height position of the engraving needle  is set to an upper position, as shown in . On the other hand, the user can obtain a larger engraved trace  (having a diameter of approximately 2 mm) when the height position of the engraving needle  is set to a lower position, as shown in . Since the engraved traces  and  become cloudy, an engraved pattern is made by utilizing clouding.The user can prepare a plurality of types of engraving needles having different distal end shapes or different thicknesses, such as the engraving needle  having a pointed distal end as shown in , the spherical engraving needle  with a smaller diameter as shown in , or the like. In this case, the user selects and attaches an engraving needle with a desirable shape to the supporting member . Small holes can be made when the workpiece W is engraved by the engraving needle  with the pointed distal end. Furthermore, a plurality of engraving needle holders  with different types of engraving needles may be prepared.schematically illustrates an electrical arrangement of the multineedle sewing machine  with a control circuit  being focused around. The control circuit  serves as a control unit which controls an overall operation of the multineedle sewing machine . The control circuit  is mainly composed of a computer or a central processing unit (CPU). A ROM , a RAM  and a memory  are connected to the control circuit . The ROM  stores an embroidery sewing control program, an engraving process control program, various types of control data and the like. The memory  stores data of various types of embroidery patterns for embroidery sewing, engraving process data and the like.Operation signals generated by various operation switches  on the operation panel are supplied to the control circuit . The control circuit  then controls the LCD . In this case, while viewing contents displayed on the LCD , the user operates the operation switches  so that the multineedle embroidery sewing machine  can execute a desired operation. A detection signal generated by the frame type sensor  of the transfer mechanism  is also supplied to the control circuit . The control circuit  then controls the sewing machine motor  via a drive circuit  and further controls the needle bar selecting motor  via a drive circuit . The control circuit  then controls the Y-direction drive motor  of the transfer mechanism  via a Y-direction drive circuit  and the X-direction drive motor  via an X-direction drive circuit . As a result, the frame holder  and accordingly the embroidery frame  or the engraving support  are moved.Furthermore, the control circuit  executes the embroidery sewing control program to control the sewing machine motor , the needle bar selecting motor , the X- and Y-direction drive motors  and  of the transfer mechanism  and the like, based on the pattern data the user has selected from the pattern data for embroidery sewing stored on the memory , for example, so that an embroidery sewing operation is automatically executed on the workpiece cloth held by the embroidery frame . In this case, the aforementioned pattern data for embroidery sewing contains stitch data (transfer data) indicative of a needle location per stitch (an amount of movement of the embroidery frame  in the X- and Y-directions), color change data indicative of change of color of embroidery thread (the needle bar  to be driven), thread cutting data indicative of a thread cutting operation, sewing end data and the like, as well known in the art.In the foregoing embodiment, upon execution of an engraving process control program, the control circuit  controls the sewing machine motor , the needle bar selecting motor , the X- and Y-direction drive motors  and  of the transfer mechanism  and the like, based on the engraving process data. As a result, the engraving process operation is automatically executable by the engraving needle  on the surface of the workpiece W held on the engraving support . In the engraving process operation, the needle bar No.  is selected, and the workpiece W is repeatedly moved to the following engraving point during upward movement of the needle bar No.  while the needle bar No.  (the engraving needle ) is moved upward and downward. In this case, the engraving process data is mainly composed of a collective of engraving points per stitch (engraving locations) or transfer data indicative of amounts of movement of the workpiece W in the X- and Y-directions. The control circuit  executes the engraving process on condition that the frame type sensor  has detected attachment of the engraving support  to the frame holder . More specifically, in the case where attachment of the engraving support  has not been detected, the control circuit  prohibits start-up of the sewing machine motor  even when the execution of the engraving process has been instructed by the user.The following describes the operation of the foregoing construction. The multineedle embroidery sewing machine  can execute the engraving operation in which a desired engraving pattern is formed on the workpiece W in the following manner, as well as the normal embroidery sewing operation. More specifically, a plurality of engraved traces (dents) or small holes is formed on the thick tracing paper used as the workpiece W. Thus, the parchment craft in which a decor is made can be carried out. In execution of the engraving operation, the user attaches to the needle clamp of the needle bar No.  the mounting portion  of the engraving needle holder  holding the engraving needle . The user further attaches the engraving support  holding the workpiece W to the frame holder . The user then selects engraving process data of the desired engraving pattern, starting the engraving operation. In this case, the control circuit  controls the operation based on the detection by the frame type sensor  in startup of the sewing machine motor . More specifically, in starting the operation thereof, the control circuit  determines whether or not the engraving support  has been attached, based on an output signal generated by the frame type sensor .When determining that the engraving support  has not been attached, the control circuit  controls the LCD  so that a message prompting correct attachment of the engraving support  is displayed on the LCD  and further controls the sewing machine motor  so that the motor  is not started up.On the other hand, when determining that the engraving support  has been attached, the control circuit  executes an engraving operation by the engraving needle . In this case, the control circuit  drives the needle bar No.  to which the engraving needle holder  has been attached, by the needle bar selecting motor , while controlling the transfer mechanism to move the engraving support , namely, the workpiece W in the X- and Y-directions, based on the engraving data. As a result, the engraving needle  is caused to abut the surface of the workpiece W so that a plurality of engraved traces  and  according to the engraving data is formed on the workpiece W, whereby a predetermined engraved pattern including the engraved traces is formed.The user loosens the setscrew  while the engraving needle holder  is attached to the needle bar . Thus, the user can adjust the height position of the engraving needle  while viewing the reference lines . When matched with an upper reference line , the engraving needle  occupies a lower position (see ). On the other hand, when matched with a lower reference line , the engraving needle  occupies a higher position (see ). When the engraving needle  is located lower, larger (deeper) engraved traces  are formed on the workpiece W, whereas smaller (shallower) engraved traces  are formed on the workpiece W when the engraving needle  is located higher.An engraved pattern as shown in  is composed of two types of traces, that is, smaller engraved traces  and larger engraved traces . In this case, engraving data includes engraving data for forming the smaller engraved traces , data for interrupting an engraving operation to instruct change in the height position of the engraving needle , and engraving data for engraving the larger engraved traces . These data are executed sequentially in the above-described order. Firstly, the user loosens the setscrew  to set the height position of the engraving needle  to a position as shown in , thereafter tightening the setscrew  to fix the engraving needle . Subsequently, the user starts the engraving operation with the result that an engraved pattern comprising the smaller engraved traces  is formed on the workpiece W.Upon completion of the smaller engraved traces , the engraving operation is once interrupted and instructions to change the height position of the engraving needle  (instructions to lower the engraving needle by 0.4 mm, for example) are displayed on the LCD . The user then loosens the setscrew  to change the height position of the engraving needle  to the position as shown in , thereafter tightening the setscrew  to fix the engraving needle . Subsequently, the engraving operation is re-started so that the larger engraved traces  are formed on the workpiece W.According to the multineedle embroidery sewing machine  provided with the engraving needle holder , the mounted part  is mounted to the needle clamp located at the lower end of the needle bar , whereby the engraving needle  can be mounted to the needle bar . Accordingly, the engraving needle  can be attached to and detached from the needle bar  without detachment of the needle clamp . Consequently, the engraving operation can be realized on the workpiece W in addition to the normal embroidery sewing operation on the workpiece cloth, whereby the multineedle embroidery sewing machine  can be used as an apparatus for executing an engraving process.Furthermore, the engraving needle  is attached to the supporting member  provided on the lower end of the mounted part  so as to be positionally adjustable, and the height position of the engraving needle  relative to supporting member  can be adjusted by the adjusting mechanism comprising the setscrew . Accordingly, the user can easily adjust the height position of the engraving needle  relative to the needle bar  with the engraving needle holder  remaining attached to the needle bar . Consequently, when adjusting the height position of the engraving needle , the user can change the size of the engraved traces formed on the workpiece W by the engraving process or the size of the small holes. Furthermore, the user can also change among the engraving needles  with different distal end shapes.Furthermore, since the reference lines provided on the base of the engraving needle  are viewable, the user can accurately grasp and adjust the height position of the engraving needle . Accordingly, the user can accurately set the sizes of the engraved traces or small holes to be formed on the workpiece W.Additionally, the user can position the mounting portion  relative to the needle clamp with respect to the rotational direction using the D-cut portion thereof. Consequently, the engraving needle holder  can be attached to the predetermined position relative to the needle bar .show the engraving needle holder  according to a second embodiment. The following describes the differences between the engraving needle holders  and  according to the first and second embodiments respectively. Although the engraving needle  is held so as to be located on the left of the mounted part  in the first embodiment, the engraving needle  is supported so as to be located in front of the needle bar  in the second embodiment.The engraving needle holder  is provided with the mounted part  and the supporting member  as in the first embodiment. The mounted part  is also formed with the D-cut portion as in the first embodiment. The supporting member  is a rectangular block extending frontward from the lower end of the mounted part .The supporting member  has a through hole which is located in a front portion thereof and extends vertically therethrough. The mounted part  has a screw hole which extends rearward from a front portion thereof to reach the insertion hole . A hexagon socket screw  is threadingly engaged with the screw hole . The engraving needle  is supported by the setscrew  so that the height position of the engraving needle  is adjustable.Since the supporting member  of the engraving needle holder  extends frontward as described above, the user can attach the engraving needle holder  to needle bar Nos.  to  as well as to needle bar No. . More specifically, the user can attach the engraving needle holders  provided with the respective engraving needles having different height positions or shapes. Thus, since the engraving process data is configured to select a plurality of needle bars  and to execute the engraving process, various engraving processes with different sizes of engraved traces (dimples) or small holes can continuously be executed.The foregoing embodiments should not be restrictive but may be modified or expanded as follows. Although the multineedle embroidery sewing machine  has six needle bars  in the foregoing embodiments, the sewing machine with a single needle bar  may be used, instead. Furthermore, the number of needle bars  provided in the multineedle embroidery sewing machine  may be 9, 12, etc. Thus, various changes may be made in an overall structure of the multineedle embroidery sewing machine , the structure of the transfer mechanism  (the carriage ) and the structure of the engraving support .Furthermore, various changes may be made in the structure of the engraving support . For example, the supporting member may comprise two front-rear divided members and may be configured so that the base of the engraving needle may be interposed between the divided members. Additionally, the adjusting mechanism may comprise a screw having a knob the user pinches to turn the screw.Additionally, the engraving needle  may be provided with a plurality of notch grooves, instead of the reference lines , and a plurality of annular protrusions engaging the respective notch grooves. As a result, the operation for position adjustment of the engraving needle  can be rendered easier.The foregoing description and drawings are merely illustrative of the present disclosure and are not to be construed in a limiting sense. Various changes and modifications will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. All such changes and modifications are seen to fall within the scope of the appended claims."

                "This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-150993 filed on Jul. 1, 2010, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.1. Technical FieldThe present disclosure relates to a sewing machine which is provided with an engraving needle attached to a needle bar thereof and can execute an engraving work to form engraved marks by moving the engraving needle upward and downward while a workpiece is transferred in two predetermined directions by a transfer mechanism.2. Related ArtThere has conventionally been provided a multineedle embroidery sewing machine which can continuously execute embroidery sewing with the use of multicolor embroidery threads, for example. The embroidery sewing machine of this type is provided with a needle bar case which is mounted on a distal end of a sewing machine arm and has, for example, six needle bars. One of the needle bars is selectively coupled to a needle bar driving mechanism thereby to be vertically driven. The embroidery sewing machine is also provided with a transfer mechanism which transfers an embroidery frame holding a workpiece cloth. The embroidery sewing machine further includes a control device to which is supplied pattern data indicative of a needle location per stitch (an amount of movement of the workpiece cloth), color change and the like. The control device controls the needle bar driving mechanism and other driving mechanisms while controlling the transfer mechanism so that an embroidery frame holding the workpiece cloth is moved in two or X and Y directions, based on the supplied pattern data, whereby a multi-color embroidery sewing operation is executed.The embroidery sewing machine of this type includes one provided with a boring device which makes a cut or bores a hole in the workpiece cloth. The boring device comprises a mount, a holder, a boring knife, a presser and a spring. The boring knife has a lower end formed with a blade portion. The boring device is attached to a specific one of needle bars and the operation of the embroidery sewing machine is started. As a result, eyelet embroidery is executable in which embroidery is made around a cut while the cut or the hole is being formed in the workpiece cloth.On the other hand, a plurality of dents (embossment) or small holes has recently been formed in a sheet-like workpiece such as paper in a handicraft field, so that various types of patterns have been expressed using the dents or small holes. For example, a parchment craft has been becoming popular in which a plurality of dents or small holes is formed in thick tracing paper, which is formed into a decor. In this case, only the dents become cloudy when formed in the tracing paper. Patterns are made by utilizing the cloudy dents.The inventors contemplated using a multineedle embroidery sewing machine as an apparatus which executes an engraving process to form the aforesaid dents or small holes by attaching an engraving needle for parchment craft, instead of the sewing needle. In this case, a holder to fixedly hold the sheet-like workpiece such as tracing paper is attached to a transfer mechanism, instead of an embroidery frame holding workpiece cloth. Based on generated engraving process data, a control device controls a needle bar to which the engraving needle is attached so that the engraving needle is moved upward and downward while the holder is moved by the transfer mechanism, whereby a predetermined engraving process is applied to the surface of the workpiece. Thus, various patterns each comprising a plurality of engraved marks or dents or small holes would be considered to be made.A depth of engraving in the workpiece changes depending upon a mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle attached to the needle bar when the engraving process such as parchment craft or the like is executed by utilizing drive of the needle bar provided in the sewing machine. More specifically, the size of the engraved marks or dents or small holes to be formed on the workpiece changes. Accordingly, it has been sought that the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle attached to the needle bar should be easily adjustable by the user. In this case, the size of an eyelet is changeable by adjusting the heightwise position of the boring knife relative to the holder in the conventional boring device.The following work is considered to be done in order that the user may adjust the mounting height of the engraving needle relative to the needle bar. The user prepares a test workpiece to actually carry out a trial process, that is, an engraving process on the test workpiece. When visually observing an engraved mark, the user determines whether or not the size of the engraved mark is suitable, adjusting the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle. In this case, the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle is raised when the dent is excessively large. On the contrary, the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle is lowered when the dent is excessively small. The aforementioned work is continued several times so that the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle can finally be adjusted to a suitable position.However, criterion for a determination as to whether or not the engraved mark has a suitable size depends upon the user's subjective view in the above-described adjusting manner. In particular, it is difficult for a user with less experience in the adjusting work to make a right determination. Furthermore, the adjusting work is troublesome since the trial process and the mounting heightwise position adjustment need to be carried out repeatedly. Additionally, the test workpieces are scrapped after having been used. Thus, since a large number of test workpieces are required, the test workpieces become useless.Therefore, an object of the disclosure is to provide a sewing machine which can execute an engraving process with the engraving needle being attached to the needle bar and can make a right determination as to the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle without depending upon the user's subjective view and in which the adjusting work can easily be done by the user.The present disclosure provides a sewing machine which includes a needle bar to which an engraving needle is attached and is capable of executing an engraving process of engraving a plurality of marks on a workpiece by moving the engraving needle upward and downward while the workpiece is transferred in two predetermined directions by a transfer mechanism, the sewing machine comprising a heightwise position adjusting mechanism which adjusts a mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle relative to the needle bar; an imaging unit which images the dents formed on the workpiece by the engraving needle, thereby obtaining an image of each engraved mark; a detection unit which extracts a region of each engraved mark from the image to detect a size of each engraved mark; a determination unit which compares the size of each engraved mark detected by the detection unit with a reference value stored, thereby determining a mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle; and an informing unit which informs of information for adjusting the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle according to a determination made by the determination unit.The disclosure also provides a sewing machine which includes a needle bar to which an engraving needle is attached and is capable of executing an engraving process of engraving a plurality of engraved marks on a workpiece by moving the engraving needle upward and downward while the workpiece is transferred in two predetermined directions by a transfer mechanism, the sewing machine comprising a heightwise position adjusting mechanism which adjusts a mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle relative to the needle bar; an imaging unit which images the engraved marks formed on the workpiece by the engraving needle, thereby obtaining an image of each engraved mark; a first determination unit which compares the engraved pattern in an image obtained by the imaging unit with a part of the image excluding the engraved marks, thereby determining a color luminance of each engraved mark; a second determination unit which compares the color luminance of each engraved mark determined by the first determination unit with a reference value stored on a storage unit, thereby determining the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle; and an informing unit which informs of information for adjusting the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle according to a determination made by the determination unit.A first embodiment will be described with reference to .

Additionally, detection is also executed by the aforesaid detection unit when the holder  is attached to the frame holder  as will be described later.The holder  will now be described. The holder  includes a rectangular plate-shaped holding portion  having rounded corners and a pair of connecting members  attached to right and left ends of the holding portion  respectively, as shown in . The holding portion  has a bottomed holding recess which is located at the underside of the holding portion  and is rectangular in shape except for a peripheral frame-shaped portion. An elastic member is provided in the holding recess . The elastic member is made of a material such as a foamable resin or rubber and formed into a rectangular thin plate shape. The workpiece W such as tracing paper is previously cut into a rectangular plate-shape according to the holding recess . The workpiece W is placed on an upper surface of the elastic member to be fixed by a fixing unit such as a double-side adhesive tape.The paired connecting portions  have rotational symmetry through 180 degrees in a plan view. Each connecting portion  is formed with an engagement groove and an engagement hole for attachment to the frame holder . The horizontal width L of the holder  is set so as to differ from the width L of each type of embroidery frame  as described above. Additionally, a plurality of types of holding members  may be provided according to the size, shape, thickness or the like of the workpiece W to be engraved.The frame holder  to which the embroidery frame  or the holder  is attached or connected will be described as follows. The frame holder  is fixedly mounted on an upper surface of the X-direction carriage  as shown in . The frame holder  includes a fixedly mounted fixed arm  and a movable arm  which is mounted on the frame holder  so as to be displaceable relative to the frame holder . The position of the movable arm  is changed in the right-left direction by the user according to the types of the embroidery frame  and the holder , that is, the width L or L.The frame holder  formed into the shape of a plate extending in the X direction includes a main part having a right end with an upper surface on which the fixed arm  is mounted so as to be laid on the upper surface. The fixed arm  has a right arm bent substantially at a right angle and extending forward. The right arm has an upper surface with a distal end on which an engagement pin  is provided, and a leaf spring  is mounted on the upper surface of the right arm so as to be located in the rear of the engagement pin . The leaf spring  is provided for holding the connecting portion . The engagement pin  is engaged with the engagement groove of the connecting portion  of the embroidery frame  or the engagement groove of the connecting portion  of the holder .The movable arm  is formed so as to be bilaterally symmetric with the right arm and has a proximal or rear end mounted on a left upper surface of a main part of the frame holder  so as to overlap the surface. The movable arm  has an upper surface provided with an engagement pin  located on a distal end thereof. The upper surface of the movable arm  further has a leaf spring  which is located in the rear of the second engagement pin  and provided for holding the connecting portion  or . The engagement pin  is engaged with an engagement hole of the connecting portion  of the embroidery frame  or an engagement hole of the connecting portion  of the holder .The movable arm  has a proximal end formed with an elongate guide groove which is elongate in the right-left direction. A guide pin  is mounted on the upper surface of the main part of the frame holder . The guide pin  is engaged with the guide groove . As a result, the movable arm  is slidable in the right-left direction relative to the main part of the frame holder . Furthermore, the main part of the frame holder  is provided with a positioning and fixing mechanism (not shown) which selectively fixes the movable arm  at one of a plurality of predetermined positions. When the user operates the positioning and fixing mechanism, the position of the movable arm  in the right-left direction is changeable.As the result of the above-described construction, the user attaches the embroidery frame  or the holder  to the frame holder  while the movable arm  is fixed to a suitable position according to the type of the embroidery frame  or the holder  to be attached, that is, the width L or L. Subsequently, the embroidery frame  or the holder  is attached to the frame holder . In attachment of the embroidery frame , the connecting portions  of the embroidery frame  are inserted between an upper surface of the movable arm  and a leaf spring  and between an upper surface of the fixed arm  and a leaf spring  from the front respectively as exemplified in . The engagement hole of the left connecting portion  is then engaged with the engagement pin  of the movable arm , and the engagement groove of the right connecting portion  is engaged with the engagement pin  of the right arm , as viewed in . As a result, the embroidery frame  is held by the frame holder  and moved in the X or Y direction by the transfer mechanism . The holder  can also be attached to the frame holder  in a similar manner as described above.A frame type sensor  is mounted on the X-direction carriage  for detecting the embroidery frame  or the holder  attached to the frame holder  based on a detected position of the movable arm , as shown in . The frame type sensor  comprises a rotary potentiometer, for example, and has a detecting element which abuts a detected portion comprising an inclined surface provided on the movable arm , for example. The frame type sensor  changes a resistance value and accordingly an output voltage value according to variations in a rotational angle of the detecting element depending upon the position of the movable arm  with respect to the right-left direction.An output signal generated by the frame type sensor  is supplied to a control circuit  which will be described in detail later, as shown in . The control circuit  then determines or detects the frame type between the embroidery frame  and the holder . Accordingly, the frame type sensor , the control circuit  and the like constitute a detecting mechanism which detects whether the holder  has been attached to the transfer mechanism .In the embodiment, the sewing machine body  can execute a normal embroidery sewing operation with the use of a workpiece cloth and six-color embroidery threads. The sewing machine body  can also execute an engraving operation in which the engraving needle  is struck against the surface of the workpiece W such as thick tracing paper in dots while the holder  is transferred in the X or Y direction by the transfer mechanism , whereby circular dents or recesses, that is, engraved marks T are formed on the workpiece W. As the result of the engraving process, a predetermined engraved pattern, for example, an engraved flower pattern as exemplified in  can be formed on the workpiece W. A suitable engraved mark T is a circle with a diameter ranging from 1 mm to 2 mm, for example.In execution of the engraving process, as shown in , the engraving needle holder  holding the engraving needle  is attached to needle bar No.  of the six needle bars , instead of the needle  as described above. The engraving needle  is configured to be shorter than the needle  and has a length that is sufficient for the engraving needle  to abut the surface of the workpiece W held by the holder  when the needle bar  occupies a lowermost position or lower dead point. The presser foot  is detached from needle bar No.  to which the engraving needle  has been attached. An embroidery sewing operation is executable using five colors of embroidery threads and needle bar Nos.  to  when the engraving needle  has been attached to needle bar No. .The depth and accordingly the size of the engraved mark T change as shown in  when a mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  relative to the needle bar  changes in execution of the engraving process on the workpiece W, which changes an engraved pattern to be formed. The size of the engraved pattern is rendered larger as the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  is low. The workpiece W such as the tracing paper would be broken when the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  is excessively low. On the other hand, the size of the engraved pattern is rendered smaller as the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  becomes high. The engraving needle  would not reach the workpiece W when the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  is excessively high. Accordingly, it is important to mount the engraving needle  to the needle bar  so that the engraving needle  occupies a suitable heightwise position. In the embodiment, the user is informed of information to adjust the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle , that is, information to locate the engraving needle  at a suitable mounting heightwise position by execution of a height determination mode as will be described later.schematically illustrates an electrical arrangement of the multineedle embroidery sewing machine with a control circuit  being focused around. The control circuit  serves as a control unit which controls an overall operation of the multineedle embroidery sewing machine. The control circuit  is mainly composed of a computer or a central processing unit (CPU). A ROM , a RAM  and a memory  are connected to the control circuit . The ROM  stores an embroidery sewing control program, an engraving process control program, an engraving needle height determining program, various types of control data and the like. The memory  stores data of various types of embroidery patterns for embroidery sewing, engraving process pattern data and the like.Operation signals generated by various operation switches  on the operation panel  and the touch panel  are supplied to the control circuit . The control circuit  then controls the LCD . In this case, while viewing contents displayed on the LCD , the user operates the touch panel  to switch the operation mode or to select a desired embroidery pattern or a desired engraved pattern by the engraving process. In this case, the operation mode includes an ordinary sewing mode, an embroidery sewing mode, an engraving process mode and a height determination mode.A detection signal generated by the frame type sensor  of the transfer mechanism  is supplied to the control circuit . The control circuit  then controls the sewing machine motor  via a drive circuit  and also controls the needle bar selecting motor  via a drive circuit . Furthermore, the control circuit  controls the Y-direction drive motor  via a drive circuit  and also controls the X-direction drive motor  via a drive circuit  thereby to move the frame holder , that is, the embroidery frame  or the holder .In the embroidery sewing mode, the control circuit  runs the embroidery sewing control program to read in embroidery data selected by the user from embroidery sewing pattern data stored on the memory . The control circuit  then controls the sewing machine motor , the needle bar selecting motor , the X-direction and Y-direction drive motors  and  of the transfer mechanism  and the like based on the pattern data, so that an embroidery sewing operation is automatically executed on the workpiece held by the embroidery frame . In this case, the aforementioned pattern data for embroidery sewing is constituted by stitch data or transfer data indicative of a needle location per stitch (an amount of movement of the embroidery frame  in the X- and Y-directions), as well known in the art. The embroidery sewing pattern data additionally contains color change data indicative of change of color of embroidery thread (the needle bar  to be driven), thread cutting data indicative of a thread cutting operation, sewing end data and the like.On the other hand, the control circuit  runs the engraving operation control program in the engraving process mode to read in the engraving process data. The control circuit  controls the sewing machine motor , the needle bar selecting motor , the X-direction and Y-direction drive motors  and  and the like, based on the engraving process data. The control circuit  automatically executes the engraving process by the engraving needle  on the workpiece W held by the holder , thereby engraving a desired pattern.In the engraving process, needle bar No.  is selected, and the workpiece W is transferred to a subsequent engraving position when needle bar No.  or the engraving needle  moved upward and downward occupies an upper position, the operation being repeated. In this case, the engraving process data is mainly configured as a location of engraved point per stitch, that is, aggregation of transfer data indicative of an amount of movement of the workpiece W per stitch in the X and Y directions.In the embodiment, the control circuit  executes the engraving process on the condition that the mounting of the holder  to the frame holder  has been detected by the frame type sensor . More specifically, in the case where the mounting of the holder  has not been detected, the control device  forbids the sewing machine motor  from startup even when execution of the engraving process has been instructed by the user.When the user operates the touch panel , the sewing machine is switchable between an engraving process mode in which the engraving process is automatically executed and a height determination mode in which the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  is determined. Accordingly, the touch panel  and the control circuit  serve as a mode switching mechanism. When the execution of the height determination mode has been instructed, the control circuit  executes the engraving needle height determining process, as will be described in the operation of the sewing machine later with reference to the flowcharts. Subsequently, the control circuit  automatically determines and informs of as to whether or not the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  is suitable. The control circuit  thus serves as a determining mode execution unit.In the height determination mode, the control circuit  firstly executes a test engraving operation by the engraving needle  on the workpiece W while a test workpiece is held by the holder . In the test engraving operation, the engraving operation is executed by the use of the engraving needle  at a plurality of times while the workpiece W is moved in the X and Y directions according to a previously stored test pattern. According to the test pattern, the workpiece W is engraved sequentially on the order of points P to P so that engraved marks T form a predetermined rhomboid or a square tilted by 45°, as shown in . However, the test pattern should not be limited to the pattern shown in .The control circuit  then controls the holder  or the needle bar case  so that the engraved marks formed on the workpiece W by the test engraving operation are located beneath the camera module . The engraved marks T of the workpiece W are imaged by the camera module . In this case, the aforementioned test pattern is set so that all the engraved marks T fall within a screen of the camera module . Since the workpiece W is a sheet of tracing paper, the workpiece W is pale white and translucent. Each engraved mark T becomes cloudy when formed on the tracing paper by the engraving needle . More specifically, each engraved mark T becomes darker than a periphery thereof. Accordingly, each engraved mark T in an image obtained by the camera module  is dark white and a part including no dent T or a part around each engraved mark T is pale white. For the sake of easiness in the description, each engraved dent T is white and the part including no dent T or the part around each dent T is black. Data of an image obtained by the camera module  is supplied through an image processing circuit  into the control circuit .The control circuit  further extracts a region of each engraved mark T from the image data to detect a size of each engraved mark T such as an area thereof. In the detection of the size (area) of each engraved mark T, it is determined whether or not each one of pixels of the image data is at a white level or a black level. The number of pixels each of which is at the white level is obtained. The detected size (area) of each engraved mark T is compared with a reference value or a threshold the data of which is previously stored on the ROM , whereby a mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  is determined. Finally, the control circuit  activates the LCD  so that the LCD  displays the result of determination of the mounting heightwise position and information to adjust the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  is displayed on the LCD . The control circuit  thus serves as the aforesaid detection unit and a determination unit. LCD  serves as an informing unit and ROM  serves as a storage unit.shows the sizes of the engraved marks Tin the obtained image, the determination of the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle , the information to be informed of (displayed) and a section of an engraved part of the workpiece W. As shown, the aforementioned determination of the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  is executed sequentially at six levels including “Needle is excessively low,” “Needle is low,” “Needle is slightly low,” “Optimum,” “Needle is slightly high,” “Needle is high.” The tracing paper as the workpiece W would break when the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  correspond to “Needle is excessively low” or “Needle is low.”An amount of adjustment to render the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  optimum is displayed on the LCD  as the information to adjust the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle . More specifically, the LCD  displays messages of “Increase by 0.6 mm,” “Increase by 0.4 mm,” “Increase by 0.2 mm,” “Optimum height,” “Decrease by 0.2 mm” and “Decrease by 0.4 mm.”The operation of the multineedle embroidery sewing machine will be described with reference to  as well as .  are flowcharts showing a processing procedure in each operation mode to be executed by the control circuit . Upon turn-on of the power supply of the sewing machine body  (START), the control circuit  determines at step S whether or not the engraving process mode setting key of the touch panel  has been operated to set the engraving process mode. When the engraving process mode has not been set (NO at step S), the control circuit  proceeds to step S to determine whether or not the embroidery sewing mode has been set.The user sets the embroidery sewing mode (YES at step S) when embroidery sewing is to be executed on the workpiece. The user then attaches the embroidery frame  holding the workpiece cloth to the frame holder , selecting desirable embroidery pattern data and turning on a sewing start key of the operation switches  (YES at step S). As a result, a sewing operation starts and the control circuit  controls the mechanisms of the sewing machine body  according to the selected embroidery pattern data, so that the embroidery sewing is executed on the workpiece cloth using six or five colors of embroidery threads (step S). On the other hand, when desiring the ordinary sewing (NO at step S), the user turns on a sewing start key of the operation switch  (YES at step S). Consequently, the control circuit  executes the ordinary sewing (step S).On the other hand, when the user has set the engraving process mode (YES at step S), the control circuit  proceeds to the next step S to determine whether or not the height determination mode has been set. When the height determination mode has not been set, the control circuit  determines that the engraving process mode has been set (NO at step S). In the engraving process mode, the control circuit  executes the engraving process of forming a large number of engraved marks T on the workpiece W, based on the engraving process data. In execution of the engraving process, the user attaches the engraving needle holder  holding the engraving needle  to needle bar No.  and also attaches the holder  holding the workpiece W to the frame holder . The user then selects engraving data of a desired engraving pattern, starting the engraving operation (YES at step S). The engraving process is then executed (step S). In the engraving process, the control circuit  controls the transfer mechanism  on the basis of the engraving data to drive needle bar No.  while the holder  and accordingly the workpiece W are freely transferred in the X and Y directions. As a result, a large number of engraved marks T are formed on the workpiece W by the engraving needle . In this case, the engraving needle  is struck against predetermined positions on the workpiece W according to the engraving data, so that a predetermined engraving pattern composed of a large number of engraved marks T is formed on the workpiece W as shown in , for example.There would be sometimes a case where the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  is unsuitable relative to the needle bar  or the engraving needle holder . In this case, the engraved marks T formed on the workpiece W are excessively small or excessively large. The user then sets the height determination mode before the engraving of the desired pattern so that the height determination mode is executed (YES at step S). Consequently, the determination of the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  or the test engraving operation is automatically carried out by the control circuit .The user attaches the engraving needle holder  holding the engraving needle  to needle bar No.  for execution of the processing in the height determination mode. With this, the user attaches the holder  holding a test workpiece W or test tracing paper to the frame holder . The sewing start key of the operation switches  is turned on in this state (YES at step S). The control circuit  then executes a test engraving operation on the workpiece W by the engraving needle  (step S). In the test engraving operation, the workpiece W is engraved sequentially on the eight points P to P according to a test pattern shown in , as described above.The engraved dent T formed on the workpiece W is imaged by the camera module  at next step S. In this case, all the engraved marks T fall within the imaging range or one screen of the camera module . When data of an image of each engraved mark T is read in, the control circuit  proceeds to step S where processing is carried out so that a contrast of each pixel is binarized into a white or black level on the basis of the obtained image data. Subsequently, the control circuit  proceeds to step S to calculate the size of each engraved mark T, that is, an area of each engraved mark T.In this case, since each engraved mark T is white and the periphery of each engraved mark T is black, the size of each engraved mark T can be obtained by calculating an area of each pixel at the white level or the number of pixels, as described above. A diameter of each engraved mark T may be calculated, instead of the area of each engraved mark T. Furthermore, diameters of a plurality of engraved marks T may be calculated and a mean value of the diameters may be obtained. The control circuit  then proceeds to step S to compare the size of each detected dent T with a reference value the data of which is previously stored on ROM  or a five-level threshold. The control circuit  further proceeds to step S to determine the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle .A six-level determination is used for the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  as shown in . The six levels include “needle excessively low,” “needle low,” “needle slightly low,” “optimum,” “needle slightly high,” “needle high.” The control circuit  then proceeds to step S to inform of information to adjust the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle , based on the results of the determination. More specifically, the control device  further controls the LCD  so that the LCD  displays six levels of messages including “Increase by 0.6 mm,” “Increase by 0.4 mm,” “Increase by 0.2 mm,” “Most suitable height,” “Decrease by 0.2 mm” and “Decrease by 0.4 mm.”Consequently, the user can adjust the engraving needle  to an optimum mounting heightwise position. In the adjustment of the mounting heightwise position, the user loosens the setscrew  of the engraving needle holder  while viewing the reference lines , thereby moving the engraving needle  upward or downward by a predetermined amount according to the above-described instructions relative to the supporting member . The setscrew  is thereafter tightened up. Thus, the engraving needle  can easily be adjusted to an optimum mounting heightwise position. Accordingly, the engraving process can be executed with the engraving needle  occupying the optimum mounting heightwise position.According to the foregoing embodiment, the engraving needle holder  holding the engraving needle  instead of the needle  is attached to the needle bar . Consequently, the multineedle embroidery sewing machine can be used as an apparatus which executes the engraving process of forming a large number of engraved marks T on the workpiece W thereby to produce an engraved pattern composed of the engraved marks T. Since the engraving needle holder  is provided with the mounting heightwise position adjusting mechanism, the engraving needle  can easily be adjusted to a suitable mounting heightwise position relative to the needle bar .The camera module  is provided for imaging the engraved marks T formed on the workpiece W. The control circuit  detects the size of each engraved mark T based on the image obtained by the camera module . Consequently, the control circuit  can accurately determine the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  from the size of the engraved mark T. The control circuit  can further inform the user of the information to adjust the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  according to the result of the determination. Consequently, the user can adjust the engraving needle  to the suitable mounting heightwise position relative to the needle bar  based on the informed information.In particular, the mode switching mechanism is provided for switching between the engraving process mode for execution of the engraving process and the height determination mode. When the height determination mode has been set, the test engraving operation is executed for the workpiece W using the engraving needle . Subsequently, the imaging of each engraved mark T by the camera module  and the detection of the size of each engraved mark T by the control circuit  are automatically executed. The determination of the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  by the control circuit  and the informing of the information on the LCD  are also automatically executed. As a result, when the user only instructs execution of the height determination mode, the process of determining the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  can automatically be executed. This can simplify the work of adjusting the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle .In execution of the above-described test engraving, the engraving operation is carried out by the engraving needle  at a plurality of times while the workpiece W is moved according to a previously stored test pattern. Accordingly, a depth of engraving and therefore the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle can accurately be determined from a plurality of images of the engraving needle. Furthermore, since the test pattern is set so that all the engraved marks fall within the imaging range of the camera module , just one imaging is sufficient and accordingly, the determining process can be expedited. Moreover, since an area of the workpiece required for the test engraving is small, an amount of workpiece to be used for the test engraving can be reduced, whereupon waste can be eliminated in the test engraving operation.illustrate a second embodiment. The second embodiment is also directed to the multineedle embroidery sewing machine. Since the hardware construction is common to the first and second embodiments, duplicated description and drawings will be eliminated and identical or similar parts in the second embodiment will be designated by the same reference symbols as in the first embodiment. Only the differences between the first and second embodiments will be described as follows.In the second embodiment, too, the engraving needle  is also mounted so that the mounting heightwise position is adjustable while the engraving needle  is held by the engraving needle holder . On the needle bar case  is mounted the camera module  serving as the imaging unit for imaging the engraved marks T formed on the workpiece W. An image obtained by the imaging unit includes a part of each engraved mark T and another part excluding each engraved mark T. The control circuit  compares these two parts of the image with each other to determine the color luminance of each engraved mark T, that is, the density of the white. The control circuit  then compares the determined color luminance of each engraved mark T or the density of the white with the reference value or threshold the data of which is stored by the ROM  serving as the storage unit, so that the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  is determined on the basis of the comparison. The control circuit  further controls the LCD  so that the LCD  displays the result of determination about the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  and information about adjustment of the mounting heightwise position. Thus, the control circuit  serves as a determination unit for determining the color luminance of the engraved mark T, a determination unit for determining the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  and an informing unit for informing of the aforementioned information.Furthermore, when the user instructs execution of the height determination mode by operation of the touch panel , the control circuit  executes the height determination process regarding the engraving needle , automatically determining whether or not the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  is suitable and informing of the result of the determination. In the height determination mode, the control circuit  controls the engraving needle  so that the test engraving operation is carried out for the test workpiece W according to the test pattern similar to that described above. The workpiece W is tracing paper.The following processes (steps S to S) are executed in the height determination mode in the second embodiment as shown in the flowchart of . The control circuit  activates the camera module  so that the engraved marks T formed on the workpiece W by the test engraving operation are imaged (step S). The control circuit  then proceeds to step S to execute a process of binarizing the luminance value of each pixel into the white or black level based on the obtained image data. The control circuit  then proceeds to step S to obtain the number of pixels of each white portion and further proceeds to step S to calculate the density of the white that is indicative of the white turbidity, that is, the color luminance from the number of pixels of each white portion.When the luminance value of each pixel has been binarized at step S, each engraved mark is rendered white and the remaining part is rendered black, as shown in . The control circuit  then calculates a ratio of the number of white level pixels to the total number of pixels thereby to obtain the white density, that is, the white density per unit area. The total number of pixels is set in an L-by-L square region containing all the engraved marks T. The control circuit  thus serves as a determination unit which compares each engraved mark T with the remaining part excluding the dents, thereby determining the white color density of each engraved mark T, that is, the color luminance.The obtained white turbidity or the white color density is compared with the reference value or a five-level threshold at step S. The mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  is determined at step S. In this case, too, the white turbidity or the white color density is rendered larger as the heightwise position becomes low and the engraved mark T becomes large. Accordingly, the control device  executes the six-level determination of “needle excessively low,” “needle low,” “needle slightly low,” “optimum,” “needle slightly high,” “needle high.”Subsequently, the control circuit  activates the LCD  at step S so that information to adjust the mounting heightwise position of each engraving needle  on the basis of the determination result is displayed, in the same manner as in the first embodiment. More specifically, the LCD  displays the control device  and further controls the LCD  so that the LCD  displays one of six-level messages including “Increase by 0.6 mm,” “Increase by 0.4 mm,” “Increase by 0.2 mm,” “Most suitable height,” “Decrease by 0.2 mm” and “Decrease by 0.4 mm.”In the second embodiment, too, the camera module  is provided which images the engraved marks T formed on the workpiece W as in the first embodiment. The control circuit  obtains the white color density of each engraved mark T, that is, the color luminance, based on the obtained image. Consequently, the control circuit  can accurately determine the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  based on the obtained color luminance. The control circuit  can inform the user of the information to adjust the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  according to the result of the determination. Accordingly, the user can adjust the engraving needle  to a suitable mounting heightwise position relative to the needle bar .Furthermore, the process to determine the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  can automatically be executed when the user has instructed the height determination mode to be executed. As a result, the adjustment of the mounting heightwise position can be simplified. In this case, the engraving depth and therefore the mounting heightwise position can accurately be determined from images of a plurality of engraved marks T obtained according to the test pattern of the test engraving operation. The determination process can be expedited since the engraved marks T are imaged once. Moreover, since an area of the workpiece required for the test engraving is small, an amount of workpiece to be used for the test engraving can be reduced, whereupon waste can be eliminated in the test engraving operation.illustrate further another or third embodiment. Two types of engraving needles  and  having different shapes are shown in  respectively. More specifically, the engraving needle  shown in  has a pointed distal end and can accordingly form a small hole in the workpiece W. The engraving needle  shown in  has a distal end that is formed into the shape of a sphere with a smaller diameter than the foregoing engraving needle . Accordingly, the engraving needle  can form a smaller engraved mark T on the workpiece W. The engraving needles  and  can detachably be attached to the needle bar  by the use of the engraving needle holder , and the heightwise positions of the engraving needles  and  can be adjustable relative to the needle bars .The foregoing embodiments should not be restrictive but may be modified or expanded as follows. The obtained image data is binarized into a white or black level in each foregoing embodiment. However, previously colored tracing paper may be employed, and the size or color luminance of each engraved mark may be detected from colored image data, instead. The determination of the mounting heightwise position of the engraving needle  should not be limited to the foregoing six levels. The number of levels may be not more than 5 or not less than 7. Information about a distance from the upper surface of the elastic member on which the workpiece W is to be placed may be used as the information to adjust the heightwise position of the engraving needle , instead. Furthermore, the current size or diameter of each engraved mark T may be used as the information to be displayed.When the execution of the height determination mode has been instructed, the multineedle embroidery sewing machine is configured to automatically start the processes in the height determination mode in each foregoing embodiment. However, the multineedle embroidery sewing machine may be configured to execute the processes including the test engraving operation, the imaging by the camera module , the detections and determinations by the control circuit  on the basis of image processing and informing the user of the information, by the switching operation or manual operation by the user, instead. Furthermore, various changes may be made regarding the location of the camera module  and the test pattern used in the execution of the test engraving operation.Furthermore, various changes may be made regarding the construction and electrical arrangement of the multineedle embroidery sewing machine capable of sewing embroidery. For example, the number of the needle bars  provided in the needlebar case  may be 9 or 12. The engraving operation is executable even by an embroidery machine provided with a single needle bar when a sewing needle is replaced by an engraving needle. Additionally, various changes may be made regarding the overall construction of the multineedle embroidery sewing machine, the construction of the transfer mechanism , the carriage , the holder  and the like.The foregoing description and drawings are merely illustrative of the present disclosure and are not to be construed in a limiting sense. Various changes and modifications will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. All such changes and modifications are seen to fall within the scope of the appended claims."

                "This application claims priority to European Patent Application No. 10425219.2 filed on Jun. 30, 2010, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.The present invention relates to a bed for a coordinate measuring machine.As is known, coordinate measuring machines generally comprise a bed designed to support the workpiece to be measured and a mobile unit for moving a measuring sensor with respect to the bed.More in particular, the mobile unit generally comprises a first carriage that is mobile on the bed along guides parallel to a first axis, a second carriage carried by the first carriage and mobile along a second axis orthogonal to the first axis, and a third carriage carried by the second carriage and mobile with respect to this along a third axis orthogonal to the first two axes. The measuring sensor is carried by the third carriage.In machines of the type briefly described above, the bed is normally made of granite, and has the dual purpose of supporting the workpiece and of defining the guides for the first carriage.This involves a series of drawbacks.In the first place, the positioning of the workpiece on the bed, particularly in the case where the weight of the workpiece is considerable, leads to a deformation of the bed itself, which causes a deformation of the guides and hence induces errors of measurement.Furthermore, the movement of the carriages of the mobile unit along the guides, and in particular of the main carriage, induces deformations on the bed and hence alters the disposition of the workpiece. Further measurement errors are thus introduced.Other drawbacks linked to the use of beds made of granite are constituted by the cost, weight, and difficulty of supply of the granite in a short time.To solve at least partially the problems linked to the workpiece weight, solutions have been proposed in which the granite bed is decoupled from the supporting structure.Illustrated in WO 89/03505 is a measuring machine comprising a metal base bearing the guides for the mobile unit, and resting on which is a workpiece table made of granite.Illustrated in GB-A-2080954 is a measuring machine in which a workpiece table made of hard mineral material is constrained to an underlying metal base, provided with the guides for the mobile unit, via positioning elements without play and such as not to transmit stresses.Both of the solutions described above call for complex and costly base structures and, in any case, use a granite table, with all the drawbacks that this entails.WO 2009/139014 illustrates a coordinate measuring machine in which, in order to solve the problems referred to above, the bed comprises a perimetral metal frame provided with guides for the mobile unit and a workpiece table housed within the frame, in which the workpiece table and the frame are constrained to one another by constraint means of an isostatic type that decouple the deformations thereof.The aim of the present invention is to provide an improvement of the machine referred to above that will be simpler, less costly, and faster to set up.The aforesaid aim is achieved by a coordinate measuring machine according to claim .With reference to , designated as a whole by  is a bed for a measuring machine.The bed  basically comprises a metal frame  and a workpiece table  supported by the frame  and conveniently made of a pourable material, preferably concrete.According to a first embodiment of the invention (), the frame  is substantially shaped like an H and comprises a pair of parallel longitudinal beams ,  spaced apart from one another, and a cross-member  perpendicular to the beams ,  and rigidly connected to these at their centres.The cross-member  conveniently has a hollow rectangular cross section. The beams ,  rest on the cross-member , to which they are fixed in a conventional way (not illustrated).The beam  is conveniently constituted by a sectional element with a hollow rectangular cross section, and carries a top guide  and a side guide  () for a main carriage of the machine (not illustrated). The beam  is conveniently constituted by a sectional element having an I-shaped cross section, and carries at the top a third guide  for the carriage.The workpiece table  is housed with lateral play between the beams ,  () and is conveniently covered over again with a top layer  of granite or ceramic material defining the working surface  of the measuring machine ().The frame  rests on three supports , , , of which two (, ) are set in intermediate lateral areas of the beam , and one () is set underneath the cross-member , in the proximity of the beam .The supports ,  each comprise a resting foot  and a bracket , which is fixed on the resting foot  via an anti-vibration support  ().The brackets  of the supports ,  have a first portion  fixed underneath the beam  and a second portion  projecting in cantilever fashion from the beam  towards the inside of the frame . The resting feet  are set in the second portion .The support  comprises a resting foot  fixed to the cross-member  via an anti-vibration support .The workpiece table  is supported on the brackets  of the supports ,  and on the cross-member  via constraint means  designed to decouple the deformations of the workpiece table  from those of the frame .The constraint means  are located exactly on the vertical of the supports , ,  in such a way that the constraint reactions exchanged through said constraint means do not have an arm with respect to the supports themselves.Theoretically, to obtain a perfect decoupling between the workpiece table  and the frame  it is necessary for the constraint means  to define an isostatic constraint system. In practice, if the relative translations between the workpiece table  and the frame  can be considered negligible, the constraint means  can be of a statically indeterminate type provided that they enable at least the relative rotations.An example of embodiment of the constraint means  is illustrated in WO 2009/139014, the description of which is incorporated herein for reference, for the parts necessary.In the case where the relative translations cannot be considered negligible, it is necessary to envisage an isostatic constraint system.In general, an isostatic constraint system is such if it eliminates all and only the six degrees of freedom of relative motion between the workpiece table  and the frame . To eliminate the six degrees of freedom, in general three constraints must be used: one constraint eliminates three degrees of freedom, one eliminates two degrees of freedom, and the third eliminates the residual degree of freedom.Examples of isostatic constraints are provided in WO 2009/139014.illustrate a second embodiment of the bed, designated by the number .The bed  comprises a frame  that differs from the frame  described in that it comprises two cross-members ,  parallel to one another and rigidly connected, at their own ends, with the beams  and  in an intermediate lateral area thereof. The cross-members ,  have a cross section shaped like a U turned upside down, and the beams ,  rest on the cross-members themselves.In this case, the three supports , ,  are set underneath the cross-members , ; in particular, two supports (, ) are set in the proximity of the ends of the cross-member , with respect to the beams , , whilst the third support () is set in the centre of the cross-member .The workpiece table  is supported on the cross-members ,  via constraint means  designed to decouple the deformations of the workpiece table  from those of the frame .The constraint means  are again set on the vertical of the supports , , .From an examination of the characteristics of the bed  made according to the present invention, the advantages that it affords are evident.Albeit achieving all the advantages linked to the decoupling of the deformations of the workpiece table from those of the frame, the structure of the latter is considerably simplified with respect to the solutions known previously.In particular, a smaller number of pieces is used, assembly is faster, and the cost of the frame is lower.The reduction of stiffness of the frame that follows inevitably from the use of an H frame or a frame with two cross-members with respect to a closed perimetral frame does not entail any drawback from the metrological standpoint in so far as the errors due to the major deformations of the guides can be corrected during geometrical compensation of the machine.Modifications and variations may be made to the bed ,  described, without thereby departing from the scope of protection of the claims.The bed according to the invention can be used in coordinate measuring machines of any type, for example bridge or horizontal-arm measuring machines.The workpiece table  can be made of a different material, for example a thermoplastic resin containing appropriate fillers.Furthermore, the frame ,  can be made with a plurality of beams made of composite or stone material instead of metal sectional elements.Finally, in the embodiment in which the frame comprises two cross-members, these might not be parallel to one another."

                "The present invention, as expressed in the title of this specification, relates to a detection method to control the migration of banded sleeves in difficult to access hardware and detection device.The method is intended to detect in time any axial displacement of a banded sleeve in cases where access is not good, but difficult and that at a simple visual inspection and standard measuring tools (rulers, calipers, . . . ) are not reliable enough, to be sure if the banded sleeve has migrated or not.Therefore, the invention is applicable mainly in cases in which there is no good access to the area to be inspected and precision in determining whether the banded sleeve has migrated or has not migrated is needed. To do this, a characteristic tool has been designed by which it can be determined with complete security and reliability if the banded sleeve has migrated or has not migrated and thus being able to take the necessary measures to correct this anomaly in time to avoid problems of wear and more serious problems arising from the anomaly of the migration or axial displacement of the banded sleeve.Banding sleeves on hardware is a very common technique from the standpoint of design, so that today there are many joints in which some sliding sleeves are fitted over some banded sleeves these in turn embedded in holes in the hardware itself, being adjusted on the other side on the sliding sleeves a bolt or similar axially fixed, through which all of the hardware assembly is linked to another element. In all cases, all of the sleeves shall be adjusted with a predetermined and perfectly calculated torque.Thus, in principle banded sleeves must remain fixed throughout the life of the joint, but in reality we can find cases where these sleeves “migrate” and leave their housing in the hardware. This migration causes a loss of strength in the hardware lug, and may even lead to its failure with the serious consequences that this would imply.Hence the importance of knowing throughout the life of the aircraft if these sleeves are well installed or, if on the contrary, have lost torque and have migrated.The way to see in service, during maintenance, if these sleeves migrate or not is through a detailed visual inspection of the area. Also, in some cases if the access allows us, we can measure with a gauge the diameter of the visible part of the sleeve and check if it is the diameter of the banded sleeve or it is the diameter of the sliding sleeve.These methods are based on the fact that there is good access to the area in question and that simply with a visual inspection of the area or with a gauge we can determine whether the cap has migrated or not.In contrast, when the access to the area to be inspected is not good, the difficulty of a visual inspection that can be 100% reliable decreases. Moreover, even if we get access to introduce a small ruler and even if we could measure, for example, a preset distance, which . would allows us to know if there is migration, as soon as we were not able to obtain, when measuring, a good perpendicularity on the edge of a lug, that measurement could be distorted. If we add that the banded sleeve may have a very small thickness, the deviations of the perpendicular of only a few degrees can make us believe that the banded sleeve has not migrated when it has, in fact, migrated.In order to achieve the objectives and avoid the drawbacks mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, the invention proposes a detection method to control the migration of banded sleeves in hard to reach hardware, hardware that comprise a structure that incorporates pairs of lugs with holes facing each other where some banded. sleeves are adjusted with the predetermined torque where, in turn, respective sliding sleeves are adjusted on which a bolt is attached as a means of connection between the hardware and another element, said bolt being axially fixed in a conventional manner.The end edges of the banded sleeve are leveled with the facing sides of the lugs when such banded sleeve has not migrated axially moving out and therefore is located in its correct position.In contrast, when the banded sleeve migrates moving axially outward, a portion of it protrudes with respect to one of the facing sides of the lugs.To detect this anomaly a tool determined by a thin piece has been provided, one of whose faces has at least one flat surface complementary supported on the respective face of the lugs, having said tool a side tab next to one extreme front edge of such tool, the front seat of which side tab has a trajectory that is complemented by the profile of a centered portion of the free edge of the lugs, so that when the banded sleeve has migrated, by placing the tool perpendicular to the direction of the sleeves and bolt settling the flat surface of one of their faces on the respective facing side of the lug, the side tab of the tool fails to support on the centered portion of the free edge of the respective lug because the front end edge of the tool first contacts with the overhang of the banded sleeve emerging with respect to the respective outer face of the lug.However, if the banded sleeve has not migrated, the side tab of the tool will stop against the complementary free edge portion of the respective lug, showing with this that the banded sleeve is properly located, as the distance between the front seat of the side tab and the front end edge of the tool is equal to or slightly less than the distance between such free edge of the lug and the larger diameter of the sliding sleeve.Therefore, if we take the characteristic tool until its side tab supports on the respective lug, if no resistance is found it means that the banded sleeve has not migrated contacting the tool by its front end edge over the sliding sleeve. In contrast, if we find resistance before the side tab supports on corresponding lug it means that the banded sleeve has migrated having axially displaced from its location.Thus, the characteristic tool of the invention is based on the dimensions of the respective lugs and the diameters of the sliding sleeve and banded sleeve.On the other hand, it should be noted that although in theory the banded sleeves should not slip out of their position throughout their life, the reality is that in some cases such banded sleeves move axially from its initial location, for example due to the use of materials with very different expansion coefficient. Namely and particularly the migration of sleeves has been detected in titanium hardware with steel sleeve, so that the banded sleeve is chosen from a harder material precisely to protect the hardware, while the sliding sleeve is usually softer and is placed in its position with a small looseness.If, as we said above, by having a different expansion coefficient the interference relaxes and the sleeve moves, the load will not be distributed properly and the sleeve can break as well as the lug, and this may cause other breaks and more serious problems. Therefore the invention is designed specifically to detect this abnormal condition of design so that the method of the invention by means of the detection tool acts as a pass/not pass based on the size difference between the diameters of the banded and sliding sleeve.The side tab that includes the tool is designed to support on the lug such as it has been stated earlier.The detection tool is specifically designed to be used in hardware where the difference of the diameters of the sleeves is very small, making it much more difficult to detect if there has been axial displacement.This type of errors were not controlled until now, but having a user-friendly tool as the tool described in the present invention, could be incorporated into the revisions made to the hardware.Next, to facilitate a better understanding of this specification and forming an integral part of it some figures are attached wherein by way of illustration and not limitation the object of the invention has been represented.Considering the numbering adopted in the figures, the detection method to control the migration of banded sleeves in difficult to access hardware consists of detecting by means of a characteristic tool (), any minimum axial displacement of the banded sleeves () fitted in through holes () of some lugs (), of a hardware (), banded sleeves () that fit in turn some sliding sleeves (), wherein, in turn, a bolt () axially fixed is coupled, which serves as a link between such hardware () and other element not shown in the figures.The extreme edges of the banded sleeves () are leveled with the facing sides (-) of the lugs () of the hardware () when such banded sleeves () have not migrated maintaining their correct position without being axially displaced outward.In contrast, when one of the banded sleeves () migrates, an end portion thereof protrudes outward with respect to one of the facing sides (-) of the respective lug () of the hardware ().The aforementioned tool (), comprises a one piece part that has two flat faces parallel to each other, from one of which starts a side tab () of curved configuration near and parallel to a portion of a front end edge () which defines a semicircular recess which has a slightly larger diameter than the outside diameter of the sliding sleeve (), but smaller than the outside diameter of the banded sleeve ().Thus the distance between a front seat () of the side tab () and the front end edge () of the tool () will be equal to or slightly less than the distance between a centered portion () of the free edge of the lug () and the outer diameter of the sliding sleeve (), said distance corresponding to the area of less thickness of the lug ().On this premise on which is described when a banded sleeve () maintains its correct position its ends being leveled with the facing sides (-) of the respective lug  of the hardware () and an abnormal position when a banded sleeve () has migrated protruding a portion thereof with respect to one of the facing sides (-) of the lug (), the method for monitoring the correct or incorrect position of the banded sleeve () is carried out by the characteristic tool () comprising a simple one piece structure that supports on a facing side (-) of the lug () moving perpendicularly to the direction of the banded sleeve () continuing to support the tool  on such facing side (-) of the lug (), so that if the banded sleeve () is in its correct position , the displacement of the tool () is stopped when the side tab () abuts by its front seat () against the centered portion () of the free edge of the lug (), while if the banded sleeve () has migrated, the side tab () does not contact against that centered portion () of the free edge of the lug (), but the tool () contacts by its front end edge () against the projecting portion of the banded sleeve ().The front end edge () of the tool () defines a semicircular recess () which has a diameter slightly larger than the outside diameter of the sliding sleeve () but smaller than the outside diameter of the banded sleeve ()."

                "This application claims priority of co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/310,442 filed on Mar.4, 2010. The disclosure of the Provisional Patent Application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.The present disclosure relates to hair care products and more particularly relates to an upright hair dryer.Hair dryers are well known and broadly used by barbers, beauticians, hair stylist and by individuals in their own homes and hotel rooms. A hair dryer is used to apply warm or hot air to dry an individual's hair. The dryer can be combined with a brush, comb, or other grooming product for grooming the hair as it is being dried.Existing hair dryers have drawbacks in that they are unwieldy and often cumbersome to use. In view of the foregoing, there is a need for an improved hair dryer device.In view of the foregoing, there is disclosed an upright hair dryer device. In an embodiment, the hair dryer includes a base that is adapted to support the hair dryer in a predetermined orientation, such as in an upright orientation. The base is configured to serve as a stable platform for the hair dryer so as to reduce the likelihood of the hair dryer undesirably toppling over.The hair dryer includes an ergonomic neck that supports an air outlet through which air can exit the hair dryer. The neck is ergonomically designed to provide the user with a comfortable means of holding and manipulating the hair dryer.Various embodiments of the roller system are described below. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the following description of various embodiments, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the disclosed devices and methods.Before the present subject matter is further described, it is to be understood that this subject matter described herein is not limited to particular embodiments described, as such may of course vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used here in is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. Unless defined otherwise, all technical terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one skilled in the art to which this subject matter belongs.As will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading this disclosure, each of the individual embodiments described and illustrated herein has discrete components and features which may be readily separated from or combined with the features of any of the other several embodiments without departing from the scope of the subject matter described herein. Any recited method can be carried out in the order of events recited or in any other order which is logically possible.shows a perspective view of an upright dryer  that is adapted to propel air out through an orifice such as for the purpose of drying hair. The dryer  includes a base  that can be positioned on a surface for supporting the dryer in a predetermined orientation. An elongated neck  extends upwardly from the base  and forms into an air outlet  that is adapted to expel air as described in more detail below. The neck  is sized and shaped to be grasped by a user's hand such that the next  can serve as a handle for holding and manipulating the upright dryerThe upright dryer  includes an internal air blower such as in the form of an axial flow fan driven by a motor to generate an axially forced air flow directed from an air inlet  () at the rear end of the base  towards the air outlet  provided at the end of the neck . The motor is disposed downstream of the blower and may be coupled to an internal rectifier having baffles for rectification of the forced air flow. In this regard, the dryer  may include any of a variety of internal air flow directors or diffusers for guiding, diffusing or otherwise manipulating the air flow as it flows from the air inlet  to the air outlet . The motor may be any of a wide variety of motors including a DC or an AC powered motor. The motor may include a turbine having a series of rotating vanes for effecting air flow when the motor is activated. The air flow can occur along any of a variety of directions through the upright dryer, including a horizontal direction, vertical direction, or combination thereof.The dryer  may include an internal heater that is adapted to heat air that flows through the dryer . The heater may be coupled to a controller that permits a user to vary the level of heat that is applied to the air.The base  is sized and shaped to support the dryer in an upright orientation or any orientation that extends outwardly fro a flat or substantially flat surface on which the base  is positioned. For example, the base  may be positioned on a flat, horizontal surface such that the neck  extends vertically from the horizontal surface. Alternately, the base  can be suctioned (as described more fully below) to a vertical or inclined surface such that the neck  extends horizontally from the base .shows a perspective, bottom view of the dryer  with a view of the bottom surface of the base . The bottom surface of the base  may include an attachment mechanism that permits the base  to be lockingly attached to a flat surface. For example, the attachment mechanism may be configured to lock the base to the flat surface in a suction manner. For example, the base  may include one or more suction cups through which suction can be applied to the flat surface. In another embodiment, the base has a suction base bottom that can be secured to a flat surface such as using a cam lever coupled to a diaphragm on the base. When actuated, the cam lever manipulates the diaphragm to cause the suction diaphragm to hold a vacuum allowing the dryer to stick to the flat surface. In this regard, the flat surface need not be a horizontal surface. The flat surface can be horizontal, vertical, or inclined such that the flat bottom of the base can be suctioned to any flat surface.The base  is sized and shaped to serve as a secure and stable support platform for the dryer . In this regard, the base  can be widened or flared relative to the size of the neck  such that there is a reduced tendency for the dryer to topple over. The base  can have sufficient mass such that the center of gravity of the dryer is relatively low along the vertical axis of the device thereby reducing the tendency of the device to topple over. When combined with the suction capability, the size and shape of the base reduces or eliminates the likelihood that the dryer  will unintentionally topple once the dryer  is positioned on a flat surface.With reference again to , dryer  includes a display screen  that displays information. The information on the display screen  can vary and can include, for example, temperature of the air, air flow direction, air flow type, on-off state, etc. In an embodiment, the display screen  is adapted to display a visual representation of the state of the air flow such as in the form of one or more charts, graphs, velocity, waveforms, etc. The display screen  can also display an indicator that indicates when the dryer is blowing air or heating air. The display screen  can also include or be coupled to controllers, such as knobs, buttons, dials, switches, etc. that can be used to control the dryer . For example, the controllers can be used to raise or lower the air flow velocity, activate or deactivate the dryer, vary the heating temperature, etc.As mentioned, the neck  can serve as a handle for a user to grasp the dryer and manipulate the dryer in a desired manner. The neck  may be ergonomically configured to optimize the comfort of the user when holding the neck . For example, the neck  may be sized and shaped to conform to a user's hand and can include indentations that are sized and shaped to align with the user's fingers. The neck  may also be at least partially manufactured or coated with a pliable material, such as silicon or rubber, that gives and conforms to the shape of the user's hand when the user grasps and applies pressure to the neck .The neck  may be movably attached to the base  such as at an interface  that permits the neck  to be movably adjusted or reoriented relative to the base . The interface desirably permits the neck  to be rotated up to  degrees relative to the base . In addition, the airflow outlet  is movably attached to the neck  at an interface  that permits the airflow outlet  to be movably adjusted (e.g., rotated or extended) relative to the neck . The relative movement of the airflow outlet  and the neck  relative to one another and to the base  permit the dryer  to be arranged in a variety of spatial configurations and orientations.shows an enlarged, perspective view of an air outlet  of the dryer. The air outlet  can have any of a variety of shapes adapted to achieve a desired air flow profile. For example, the air outlet  can have a nozzle configuration. The air outlet  comprises an opening  through which air flows out of the dryer in a desired direction. The opening  can be equipped with one or more structures such as baffles or filters to achieve a desired air flow profile. The opening  can be adapted to diffuse air.While this specification contains many specifics, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of an invention that is claimed or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular embodiments.

A hanging mechanism may be purchased after market separately from the laundry apparatus or may be an integrated component of the laundry apparatus. Some integrated hanging systems may be retractable into the laundry apparatus when not in use for aesthetics and to not take up workspace and not be visible when not in use.In one embodiment of the invention, a laundry apparatus comprises a housing having an exterior and defining a recess opening to the exterior, and a hanging assembly slidably disposed in the recess for movement between a stored position in which the hanging assembly is disposed at least partially in the recess and a use position in which the hanging assembly is disposed at least partially exteriorly of the recess, with the hanging assembly comprising: a first portion coupled to the housing; a second portion pivotally coupled to the first portion for movement about a first axis when the hanging assembly is in the use position; and a third portion pivotally coupled to the second portion for movement about a second axis that is spaced from the first axis when the hanging element is in the use position.The present invention relates generally to a clothes hanging solution integrated with a laundry apparatus. More specifically, the invention is related to a hanging assembly integrated with a laundry apparatus which may be moveable between a stored position when not in use and in a use position when in use for hanging articles of clothing.is a schematic view of a laundry apparatus  with a hanging assembly  according to one embodiment of the invention. The laundry apparatus  may have a housing, which is formed by panels mounted to a chassis. As seen in , the panels may define a front housing surface , a rear housing surface , a side housing surface  and a top housing surface . The front housing surface  may include an opening that is selectively closed by a door  having a transparent window  within the door . The door  may be opened to access a drum  that defines a treatment chamber  for holding the laundry during the operation of the laundry apparatus .Examples of the laundry apparatus  include, but are not limited to, a washing machine, including top-loading, front-loading, vertical axis, and horizontal axis washing machines, a dryer, such as a tumble dryer, including top-loading dryers and front-loading dryers, a combination washing machine and dryer, a tumbling refreshing machine, an extractor, a combination washer and dryer, and a non-aqueous washing apparatus. Other examples of laundry apparatus  include laundry modules or laundry accessories that provide other and/or additional laundry care functionality. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/322,742, filed on Dec. 30, 2005, gives several examples of laundry modules and is hereby incorporated by reference.The laundry apparatus  may have a recess  in which the hanging assembly  is selectively received. As illustrated, the recess  may be accessible through the front housing surface . The hanging assembly  is shown in a stored position in  in which the hanging assembly  may be disposed at least partially in the recess . The recess  may reside in a portion of the laundry apparatus  that is substantially parallel to the radial axis of the treatment chamber . In a typical laundry appliance, this allows room for the hanging assembly  in space that is otherwise not used by the drum , and therefore, does not change the overall form factor of the laundry apparatus . Alternatively, the hanging assembly  may be stored in other portions of the laundry apparatus , such as in a position perpendicular to the radial axis of the treatment chamber  or in a control panel or backsplash of the laundry apparatus .is an exploded view of the hanging assembly  removed from the laundry apparatus . The hanging assembly  may include a first portion , a second portion , and a third portion , with a first hinge  coupling the first portion to the second portion, and a second hinge  coupling the second portion to the third portion.As illustrated, the first portion  may include a slide , illustrated in the form of a tube, with an end plate  closing one end of the slide , and a hinge portion  coupled to the other end of the slide  by an inset fitting  and clamp fitting holding the inset fitting  to the slide portion . The end plate  may be attached to the slide portion  by way of interlocking features in both parts. There are holes (not shown) in the slide portion  into which protruded portions on the clamped fitting  fit to hold the assembly of the slide portion , the inset fitting , and the clamped fitting  together.The first hinge  couples the first portion  and the second portion  of the hanging assembly . The first hinge  may include a first extension  that is attached to the clamped fitting . The first extension  may be attached to the clamped fitting  by slotted mated fittings on both pieces that fit together and hold the pieces in place. Alternatively, the clamped fitting  may be attached to the first extension  by welding the two pieces. The first extension  may be rotatably attached to a second extension  of the first hinge  by a pivot , such as double-ended screw, and a spring  surrounding the pivot .As illustrated, the second portion  may include a telescopic extension having multiple telescopically connected elements, such as at least one distal element and one proximal element that may slide relative to each other to adjust the length of the extension. As illustrated, the second portion  includes a proximal first non-extendable element  coupled with a distal second extendable element  via an intermediate element . The first non-extendable element  may telescopically receive the second extendable element  and the intermediate element . The second extension  of the first hinge  may be attached to the first non-extendable element  to couple the second portion  to the first portion . As with the attachment of the first extension  to the clamped fitting  of the first portion , the attachment of the second extension  to the first non-extendable element  may be by slotted fittings or by welding of the two pieces.The intermediate element  may be at least partially slidably received within the first non-extendable element , and may selectively be locked in a retracted or extended position by a mechanical lock  partially disposed within a mechanical clamp holder . The mechanical lock  includes a protrusion arm  attached to a spring arm  which biases the protrusion arm  against the inside of the first non-extendable element . A protrusion  may be provided on the protrusion arm . The mechanical clamp holder  may be attached to one end of the intermediate element  and includes a groove  for receiving the protrusion . The intermediate element  may have a through-hole  for allowing the protrusion  to pass through a side of intermediate element  when the mechanical lock  is mounted by the mechanical clamp holder . The first non-extendable element  also includes a through-hole  for allowing the protrusion  to pass through a side of the first non-extendable element . The through-hole  is formed in a location such that the intermediate element  and second extendable element  are extended with respect to the first non-extendable element  when the protrusion  is aligned with the through-hole . The mechanical lock  provides a means of locking the second extendable element  in an extended position when the hanging assembly  is in use to prevent an inadvertent retraction of the second extendable element  into the first non-extendable element . To disengage the mechanical lock , the protrusion is pushed into the through-hole  against the biasing force of the spring arm  and the second extendable element  and intermediate element  are slid into the first non-extendable element .A clamp holder  may be attached to the intermediate element  on the end opposite the mechanical clamp holder . The clamp holder  holds a first portion of a clamp  and a second portion of a clamp  around a stem  of the second extendable element  to hold the second extendable element  to the first non-extendable element .As illustrated, the third portion  may be an arm that may include a hanger  for supporting hanging articles and may have one or more notches or grooves  for supporting hanging items in spaced relation to each other. The grooves  may prevent hangers and articles from sliding off of the third portion . Alternatively, the third portion  may have a roughened finish or be covered with a material that aids in preventing slide-off. In another embodiment, the terminal or free end of the hanger  may include a raised feature to prevent slide-off. In such a configuration, the raised feature may be of a size to not prevent the third portion  and the second extendable element  of the second portion  from sliding into the first non-extendable element  of the second portion .The hanger  may be attached to one end of the second extendable element  of the second portion  by a second hinge . A screw  pivotally couples the second hinge  to the second extendable element . The second hinge  allows rotation of the third portion  relative to the second portion . The second hinge  also has means to lock into place so that the third portion  does not rotate relative to the second portion  unintentionally. The locking means may include interlocking grooves  within the second hinge  which can be disengaged by pushing the third portion  and the second extendable element  of the second portion  together. Alternatively, the third portion  may hold in place relative to the second portion  of the hanging assembly  by frictional means. An end of the hanger  may form a finger pull  that a user may grasp and pull to effect at least a portion of the movement of the hanging assembly  from the stored position to the use position.Although one embodiment of the hanging assembly  has been shown and described, it is readily apparent that variation from the embodiment shown is possible. There are a number of alternate structures for implementing an extendable second portion  of the hanging assembly , for example, by telescopically extending cylinders. In such a structure, there is a plurality of cylinders within cylinders, where each cylinder is frictionally coupled to the cylinder immediately inside and outside of it. In another embodiment, the third portion  may include more than one hanger , or the hanger  may extend in more than one direction from the second extendable element  of the second portion . In another embodiment, the third portion  may be attached to the second extendable element  somewhere other than the end of the second extendable element  of the second portion .shows a schematic view of the laundry apparatus  with the hanging assembly  in a use position.

The first portion  may be directly coupled to the housing within the recess  and is partially disposed within the recess  and partially extended from the recess . The second portion  may be pivoted to a generally vertical orientation with respect to the first portion , and the third portion  may be pivoted to a generally horizontal orientation with respect to the second portion . In the use position, the second extendable element  is extended from the first non-extendable element  of the second portion . The total length of the second portion  of the hanging assembly  may be such that the third portion  in the use position of the hanging assembly  is approximately between 24 inches and 48 inches above the top housing surface  of the laundry apparatus . In one embodiment, the total length of the second portion  of the hanging assembly  is such that the third portion  in the use position of the hanging assembly  is at least 36 inches above the top housing surface .Returning to , in the stored position, the hanging assembly  may be disposed at least partially in the recess . As illustrated, the hanging assembly  may be folded and/or retracted such that the first, second, and third portions , ,  are all received within the recess . The end of the hanging assembly  may be flush with, slightly distal of, or slightly proximal of the front housing surface . When in the stored position the second extendable element  of the second portion sits within the first non-extendable element  and the third portion  is folded against the second portion  (see ).illustrate a sequence of positions for moving the hanging assembly  from the stored position shown in  and the use position shown in .shows a schematic view of the laundry apparatus  with a portion of the laundry apparatus  removed for clarity and with the second portion  of the hanging assembly  partially extended. The recess  is defined by a hanging assembly housing , which is positioned such that an outer surface of the drum  does not contact the hanging assembly housing . The first portion  may be coupled to the hanging assembly housing  for slidably movement within the recess . As such, a sliding mechanism (not shown) may be provided for coupling the first portion  to the hanging assembly housing . The sliding mechanism may include rails, tracks, wheels, etc. within the hanging assembly housing  and on the first portion . A user may grasp and pull the finger pull  on the hanger  to effect the sliding of the first portion  within the recess . From the hanging assembly housing , the first portion  protrudes out from the front housing surface  of the laundry apparatus  such that the first hinge  is completely extended outside of the hanging assembly housing . In addition to the first portion , the first non-extendable element  of the second portion  protrudes from the front of the laundry apparatus . The second extendable element  of the second portion remains within the first non-extendable element , with the hanger  folded against the second extendable element . As such, the folded hanger  and second extendable element  fit inside the non-extendable element .is a schematic view similar to , with the second portion  of the hanging assembly  fully extended.

The second portion  may be pivoted about the first hinge  to an upright position where the second portion  extends in a direction normal to the ground. The first hinge  may rotate on an axis that is substantially parallel to the plane of the ground. The axis of rotation of the first hinge  may also be perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the hanging assembly housing  containing the recess  wherein the hanging assembly  resides when in a stored position. The first hinge  may include means to lock in to place such that the second portion  does not accidentally pivot when the hanging assembly  is in the use position. In the position shown in , the third portion  remains folded against the second extendable element , with the hanger  disposed substantially parallel to the second extendable element  or the second portion .As illustrated, the hanger  is shown to be approximately the same length as the second extendable element  of the second portion. However, the hanger  may be shorter or longer than the second extendable element . A longer length of the hanger  may be desirable since it would allow more space for hanging articles.shows a schematic view similar to , with the hanging assembly  in the use position shown in . The hanger  may be pivoted about the second hinge  to a position substantially perpendicular to the second portion . Like the first hinge , the second hinge  may also have an axis of rotation that is parallel to the plane of the ground. The second hinge  is shown to rotate in the same direction as the first hinge , but could alternatively rotate in a perpendicular direction or any direction with an axis of rotation that is parallel to the plane of the ground. When the hanging assembly  is in the use position, the second hinge  is spaced away from the first hinge  by a distance of the fully extended length of the second portion . The interlocking grooves  of the second hinge  insure that the hanger  does not unintentionally pivot relative to the second portion  when the hanging assembly  is in the use position.shows a modular system of multiple laundry apparatuses  with multiple hanging assemblies.

                "The present invention relates in general to the field of household appliances, and more particularly to laundry drying appliances like laundry dryers and washer-dryers.Garments made of delicate textile materials, such as cashmere, are not adapted to undergo regular drying treatments in a tumble dryer, owing to the mechanical stresses, mainly in the form of impacts, which the textile fibres would be subject to. More gentle drying treatments are thus recommendable for these delicate textiles, such as line drying or flat drying, which on the other hand are rather time-consuming processes.The solutions disclosed in the European patent applications EP 1845185 and EP 1854916, both in the name of the present Applicant, are effective in eliminating the above cited drawbacks, by providing a household appliance that comprises a cabinet with a worktop defining a drying surface featuring a plurality of apertures, each one of which is fluidly connected to drying air conveying means adapted to deliver a flow of warm drying air towards and through said apertures, for gently but rapidly drying garments that are laid upon the worktop drying surface.In the two cited applications, in order to warm up the flow of drying air to be conveyed through the apertures in the drying surface so as to dry the garments laid thereon, dedicated heating means are provided, for example electric heating elements arranged downstream air circulating means, i.e. a blower, that blow air into an air passage formed underneath the drying surface.The Applicant has found an effective solution for warming up the drying air to be conveyed to the drying surface of the worktop of an appliance of the type disclosed in the two cited applications.According to an aspect of the present invention, a household appliance is provided comprising a cabinet accommodating a drum for loading items to be dried and a drying air circuit for circulating drying air through the drum for drying the items therein. The drying air circuit comprises air heating elements for heating the drying air fed to the drum, and the cabinet is provided with a worktop defining a surface having a plurality of apertures in fluid communication with an air conveying system adapted to deliver a flow of air through said apertures. The air conveying system comprises an air duct thermally coupled to said air heating elements in such a way as to cause heat generated by the air heating elements to heat the air to be delivered through said apertures in the drying surface.The drying air circuit may comprise an air-cooled condenser for cooling the drying air exiting the drum and removing moisture therefrom, and the air duct is preferably arranged to collect the condenser cooling air after it has cooled the condenser.An air circulation arrangement may be provided for causing air to flow through the air duct up to the drying surface.The air circulation arrangement may comprise a blower provided in the cabinet for taking in from the outside ambient air for cooling the condenser.The air circulation arrangement may alternatively or in addition comprise a blower provided in the air conveying system for taking in from the outside ambient air and forcing it to flow through the apertures of said surface.The air duct may in particular be arranged along a back wall of the cabinet. Preferably, the air duct may be arranged to be in close proximity to said air heating elements.Preferably, a wall separating the air duct from the heating elements may be in thermally conductive material, particularly in metal.Making reference to the drawings, in  there is shown in perspective a household appliance , particularly a laundry dryer or washer/dryer for drying or washing and drying clothes and garments, of the type described in detail in the European patent application EP 1845145, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The household appliance  comprises an outer casing  with a worktop  and a front panel  carrying operational input and setting controls  for the user. A drum (not visible in the drawing), adapted to be loaded with the items to be dried or washed and dried, is rotatably accommodated and supported within a tub also accommodated in the casing , and an opening in the front panel of the casing  allows access to the tub for loading/unloading the items into/from the tub; the opening is closable by a door .The worktop  comprises a top plate member , for example in plastic or metal, which defines a drying surface , on which the garments to be gently dried (without submitting them to the stresses experimented by the items dried in the drum) are laid. The drying surface  has a plurality of apertures or perforations , each one of which is fluidly connected to drying air conveying means adapted to direct a flow of drying air through the apertures ; the air flowing through the apertures  hits the garment(s) that is (are) laid upon the drying surface , thereby drying it (them) quickly and gently.As depicted in , the drying air conveying means may comprise at least an air passage , formed in the worktop , adapted to convey the drying air underneath the drying surface , so that the drying air is then able to flow through the apertures  from the bottom upwards.The air passage  extends horizontally along and underneath the drying surface , so as to be able to supply the drying air to every aperture  essentially at the same time. An end portion  of the air passage  is blind, i.e. sealed, whereas the other end portion  thereof is open to receive the flow of drying air thereinto.The air passage  has, at a rear thereof, in correspondence of the open end portion , an elbow  that is connected to an air communication duct  located at the back of the cabinet , and conveying the drying air into the air passage .As visible in , in an embodiment of the present invention the air communication duct  extends from the bottom of the cabinet  to the worktop . The air communication duct  receives a flow of cooling air  of a condenser  of the household appliance .The condenser  is part of a closed-loop drying air circuit, adapted to cause drying air  to circulate through the rotatable drum of the household appliance ; Heating means , e.g. an electric heater, are provided in the closed-loop drying air circuit, downstream the condenser , so as to heat the drying air to be circulated through the drum.Through the closed-loop drying air circuit, the hot and moisture-laden drying air is caused to leave the rotatable drum and is conveyed towards the air-cooled condenser; then, the dehydrated drying air exiting the condenser is sent back into the drum, upon having been heated up again by the heating means , so as to remove additional moisture from the clothes being tumbled in the drum.The condenser  is an air/air heat exchanger, adapted to remove moisture from the hot moisture-laden drying air exiting the drum; the condenser  is inserted in an open-loop cooling air circuit adapted to circulate through the air-cooled condenser a stream of cooling air, which is taken in from the outside ambient to cool said condenser; air circulating means, e.g. a blower  visible in  is normally provided for causing the condenser cooling air to be taken in, through an air intake aperture  provided in the rear wall of the cabinet , from the outside ambient and to be conveyed by means of a cooling air conveyor  so as to pass through the condenser . The condenser  comprises a plurality of fluid passageways, along which the clothes drying air is able to flow for having the moisture condensed and removed therefrom, and these fluid passageways are exposed to the flow of cooling air flowing in the open-loop cooling air circuit. When the cooling air passes through the condenser, the drying air temperature is lowered and heat is transferred to the cooling air.An example of household appliance having the described closed-loop drying air circuit and open-loop cooling air circuit is provided in the European patent application No. 1936022 in the name of the present Applicant.Normally, the condenser cooling air, after having cooled the condenser , is returned to the outside ambient through an exhaust aperture  provided for example in a rear wall of the cabinet .According to an embodiment of the present invention, the flow of cooling air used to cool the condenser, which is warm due to the transfer of heat occurring in the condenser , instead of being released into the ambient, is taken in by the air communication duct , which at its bottom end  has an aperture facing the exhaust aperture  in the cabinet ; in this way the air communication duct  is fluidly connected to the condenser  for receiving condenser cooling air. The air communication duct  conveys the warm condenser cooling air  up to the air passage  underneath the drying surface , and thus the warm condenser cooling air  is advantageously exploited for gently drying the garments laid on the drying surface , without the need of providing dedicated heating means, as were provided in the solutions of the cited applications EP 1845185 and EP 1854916.Advantageously, the air communication duct  is thermally coupled to the heating elements  provided in the closed-loop drying air circuit of the household appliance  for heating up the drying air to be conveyed to the drum, particularly, as visible in , the air communication duct  is arranged in closed proximity to the heating elements . Preferably, a wall  separating the closed-loop drying air circuit and the air communication duct  is, at least in correspondence of the heating elements , in thermally conductive material, e.g. metal. In this way, the drying air which passes through the air communication duct  to be conveyed to the drying surface  is further heated up.In this way, both the provision of heating elements dedicated to heating the drying air to be conveyed to the drying surface , and the provision of air circulating means, e.g. a blower, dedicated to the circulation of the drying air to be conveyed to the drying surface  may be dispensed for. In fact, the drying air used for drying garments laid on the drying surface  is forced to circulate through the air passage  and the apertures  by the blower that is provided in the open-loop cooling air circuit for taking in cooling air from the outside ambient and pass through the condenser ; the condenser cooling air is already warm due to the transfer of heat occurring in the condenser , wherein the hot drying air coming from the drum releases heat to the condenser cooling air, and, passing close to the heating means , the air conveyed to the drying surface is further heated up.In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, instead of exploiting the condenser cooling air, air taken in from either the outside ambient or the interior of the cabinet  (which, being normally not air-tight, is in fluid communication with the outside ambient) may be exploited for drying the garments laid on the drying surface . In this case, as depicted in , the aperture in the bottom end  of the air communication duct  needs not to face the exhaust aperture  provided in the cabinet  for discharging the condenser cooling air; instead, an aperture  may be provided in the bottom end  of the air communication duct  adapted to take in air from the external ambient. Also, as visible in , air circulating means , e.g. a blower dedicated for taking in air through the aperture  and for circulating the drying air to be conveyed to the drying surface  are provided, accommodated for example upstream the elbow , as disclosed for example in the European patent application EP 1845145, for causing air to flow up the air communication duct . In any case, as in the previous invention embodiment, the air communication duct  is thermally coupled to the heating elements  provided in the closed-loop drying air circuit of the household appliance  for heating up the drying air to be conveyed to the drum, particularly, the air communication duct  is arranged in closed proximity to the heating elements , and preferably the wall  separating the closed-loop drying air circuit and the air communication duct  is, at least in correspondence of the heating elements , in thermally conductive material, e.g. metal. The air communication duct , passing in close proximity to the heating elements  provided in the closed-loop drying air circuit of the household appliance  for heating up the air to be conveyed to the drum, allows heating the air without the necessity of providing dedicated heating means.This second embodiment of the invention, compared to the first embodiment described, does not require that the closed-loop drying circuit of the household appliance be activated for drying garments laid upon the drying surface. The commands for the operation of the air circulating means  and the heating elements  may be placed/integrated on the worktop , as shown in  where the commands are denoted .Preferably, the heating elements  in the closed-loop drying air circuit of the household appliance, and the air circulating means for taking in condenser cooling air or the air circulating means , are activatable under command of the user also when the drying cycle of the clothes in the drum of the household appliance is not to be started, but there are garments laid upon the drying surface  to be dried.The present invention can be advantageously applied to any household appliance having a worktop defining a drying surface for gently drying garments; in particular, the present invention is applicable to any one of the household appliance embodiment described in the cited applications EP 1845185 and EP 1854916; in particular, the present invention is applicable to a household appliance in which the worktop comprises a drawer-like element having a perforated drying surface that can be extracted from the worktop to increase the overall drying surface or to facilitate the usage of the drying surface in case of obstacles that prevent the user from laying garments directly on the worktop.The present invention has been here disclosed by presenting some embodiments thereof, however those skilled in the art will readily recognize that several modifications to the described embodiments, as well as several alternative embodiments are possible, without departing from the scope of the appended claims."

                "This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional patent application No. 61/361,300, filed Jul. 2, 2010, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.The present invention relates to clothes dryers and, more particularly, to a hybrid heat clothes dryer.Conventional resistive electric heat clothes dryers require a significant electric power supply, often up to about 30 amperes. Environmentally conscious consumers and/or those consumers seeking to reduce their electric consumption, often look for alternative means for clothes drying. Some alternative methods, such as air drying, may result in stiff clothes. Air drying also does not permit the use of dryer sheets, which may be useful to soften and freshen clothing.As can be seen, there is a need for a clothes dryer that may be able to use an alternate heat source for clothes drying.In one aspect of the present invention, a hybrid heat clothes dryer comprises a hydronic coil adapted to receive a liquid, the liquid capable of being warmed by an exterior heat source; a blower adapted to pass air over the hydronic coil and into the clothes dryer; and a control circuit adapted to switch a resistive heat element on and off.In another aspect of the present invention, a method for drying clothes, comprises placing the clothes into a dryer drum of a dryer; providing a flow of air into the dryer drum; warming the flow of air by passing the flow of air over a hydronic coil, the hydronic coil having warmed liquid flowing therethrough; detecting a temperature of the flow of air passing into the dryer drum; and activating a resistive heating element if the temperature is below a predetermined minimum.These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings, description and claims.The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out exemplary embodiments of the invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.Various inventive features are described below that can each be used independently of one another or in combination with other features.Broadly, an embodiment of the present invention provides a clothes dryer that may rely on a hybrid heat source for drying clothes. In some embodiments, the clothes dryer may rely on a combination of electrical energy to power the clothes dryer and hydronic heat to dry clothes. The hydronic heat may, for example, use hot water from an outdoor wood boiler circulated into a hydronic coil. Air passing over the hydronic coil may be warmed and delivered to the clothes dryer. The hybrid heat clothes dryer may reduce energy consumption from about 27 amperes to about 3 amperes.Referring now to , a hydronic heat clothes dryer  may include a clothes drying unit  and a hybrid heat driver . The hybrid heat driver  may be configured as an air-liquid heat exchanger, where a liquid may pass through tubing (a hydronic coil, for example) within the hybrid heat driver . Air passing over the tubing may be warmed as it passes through the hybrid heat driver . The liquid in the tubing may be, for example, water. The liquid may be warmed in, for example, an outdoor wood boiler. In other embodiments, the liquid may be warmed by a gas fired furnace, an oil fired furnace, a hot water storage tank or the like.A blower  may deliver air across the hybrid heat driver  and into the dryer unit  via a heat supply duct . The air entering the dryer unit  may pass through factory elements  before being released into a dryer drum . The factory elements  may provide supplemental heat to the air entering the dryer drum  as may be necessary, for example, when high heat is called for or when the source of heat for the hybrid heat driver  is shut down. Warmed air entering the dryer drum  may be discharged through an exhaust vent .The dryer unit  may include a plurality of indicator lamps. For example, the dryer unit  may include an “electric heat” indicator lamp  and a “hybrid heat” indicator lamp . A master switch  may be disposed on the dryer unit  for turning the hybrid system on and off.Referring to , a schematic drawing describing the electric control of the hybrid heat dryer  is shown. While  describes one specific electric control scheme, other schemes may be used to control the hybrid heat dryer . When the call for heat begins, the resistive heat element, supply air blower and electric heat illumination lamp  are active. Voltage to the resistive heat element may be used to power the pump relay, which may be used to activate the hydronic pump located on, for example, an outdoor wood stove (not shown). When the air temperature sensor (which may be located between the hydronic coil and the original inlet of the dryer) senses the correct temperature of air, the element relay may open the circuit to the resistive heat element and the hybrid heat indicator lamp  may illuminate. At this point, the dryer is using hydronic heat to dry the clothes. If the air temperature falls below a predetermined minimum, the element relay may close to activate the resistive heat element.In some embodiments of the present invention, a time delay relay may be employed. In a typical dryer cycle, the clothes dryer calls for heat from the start of the cycle until a cool-down point is reached. At the cool-down point, the dryer may no longer call for heat and shut down the source of heat, running on air to cool the clothes in the dryer. The time delay may be used to allow the hydronic pump to continue to run during at least a portion of a cool down cycle of the dryer (the cool down cycle being from the cool-down point to the end of the overall dryer cycle (dryer shut off)). The time delay may allow the use of hydronic heat for a predefined period of time into the cool down cycle. For example, from about 20 to about 80% of the time of the cool down cycle may include hydronic heat. For example, for a 10 minute cool down cycle, from 2 to 8 minutes, typically from about 5-7 minutes, of the cool down cycle may be run with continued hydronic heat being supplied.The hybrid heat dryer  may be made through the addition of the hydronic heat driver  (hydronic coil), a supplemental blower, and a control circuit to a conventional dryer. In other embodiments, the hybrid heat dryer  may be a self-contained unit with connections to supply the dryer with recirculated warmed liquid from an exterior heat source (with the hydronic coil and blower installed within the dryer housing).It should be understood, of course, that the foregoing relates to exemplary embodiments of the invention and that modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims."

                "This is a continuation of PCT application No. PCT/EP2010/050895, entitled “METHOD AND DEVICE FOR DRYING A FIBROUS WEB”, filed Jan. 27, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference.1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a machine and a method for drying a fibrous web, in particular a cardboard, paper or tissue web, wherein the traveling fibrous web is acted upon by steam and hot, moist air in the region of a preceding drying zone and, following the preceding drying zone, is fed to a downstream drying zone which includes a drying cylinder, for example a Yankee cylinder, as well as a hood allocated thereto.2. Description of the Related ArtU.S. Pat. No. 7,351,307 B2 and WO 2008/077874 describe a method for the production of a voluminous tissue web wherein a so-called belt press is used in conjunction with a hot air hood and the use of steam for dewatering the fibrous web to a certain dry content. It is particularly important for tissue machines of this type to reduce energy consumption, especially during the drying process to achieve a predetermined dry content. Moreover there is a requirement to increase the dry content with minimal energy expenditure.A method is known, for example from EP 1 959 053, wherein exhaust air from the hood allocated to a Yankee cylinder is supplied to the hot air hood of a belt press. A large amount of steam is used by the dryer units which include a Yankee cylinder with allocated dryer hood or respectively a belt press. The energy costs associated with this result in accordingly higher costs in the paper production. Previously, the exhaust air of a hood allocated to the Yankee cylinder containing a high energy content was used to preheat the hood combustion air for the Yankee dryer and water used in the paper machine.The technology based on the use of a belt press involves an even higher steam consumption compared to conventional tissue machines which overall, leads to a negative energy balance. For this technology which is based on a belt press, hot, moist air is required as an additional energy, for which previously exhaust air from the hood allocated to the Yankee cylinder was used. To this end it was previously necessary to mix the exhaust air from the Yankee hood with fresh air in order to reduce the temperature of the air supplied to the belt press to the value necessary in this belt press. Accordingly, the moisture and enthalpy of the hot air were reduced. The temperature of the Yankee hood exhaust air is regularly higher than the temperature at which the belt press can operate.What is needed in the art is an improved method, as well as an improved device or machine, wherein the drying process, especially in regard to the energy requirement for dewatering of the fibrous web, is further optimized. To this end, the drying process, for example in the case of combined drying in a belt press and a subsequent drying unit including a Yankee cylinder with allocated dryer hood is to be accordingly optimized.The present invention provides a heat recovery system and method of drying a fibrous web wherein hot air, for example exhaust air, is taken from the hood allocated to the drying cylinder of the downstream drying zone and, to produce at least a portion of the steam for the preceding drying zone, condensate and/or fresh water occurring in the drying cylinder of the downstream drying zone is heated by the hot air extracted from the hood by means of a first heat exchanger, and/or in order to produce at least a portion of the hot, moist air for the preceding drying zone, the hot air extracted from the hood and directed through the first heat exchanger is fed to the preceding drying zone.Based on this layout the consumed steam from the steam generator is substantially reduced, thus reducing the total energy consumption accordingly. Hereby, particularly the heat to produce steam which is then further used in the paper production process is recovered. The energy is used which becomes available due to the enthalpy-drop of the exhaust air from the hood allocated to the drying cylinder, or respectively the Yankee cylinder. On the one hand, steam is produced. On the other hand, the hot air emerging from the heat exchanger and having a lower temperature is further utilized in the paper production process, whereby the produced steam, as well as the hot air which has cooled to a lower temperature, can be further utilized, for example in a belt press.In accordance with a first embodiment of the method of the present invention, steam is immediately produced from the furnished condensate and/or fresh water by means of the first heat exchanger and this steam is fed to the preceding drying zone.According to a second embodiment of the method of the present invention, the condensate and/or fresh water is first heated by means of the first heat exchanger. Following this first heat exchanger, the heated condensate and/or fresh water are then fed to a flash-evaporation device whereby the steam produced through flash evaporation is then fed to the preceding drying zone. Condensate occurring during flash evaporation is advantageously returned to the first heat exchanger and is heated in same by the hot air extracted from the hood, together with the condensate and/or fresh water occurring in the drying cylinder of the downstream drying zone.According to a third embodiment of the inventive method, fresh air is heated in a second heat exchanger by means of hot air taken from the hood, and the thereby heated fresh air is supplied as combustion air and/or make-up air to the hood allocated to the drying cylinder of the downstream drying zone. “Make-up” air is to be understood, for example, to be air for preheating of the drying zone and/or the drying system. Preheating occurs, for example, during start-up of the tissue machine.The extracted hot air can be directed first through the first heat exchanger which is provided for heating of the condensate and/or the fresh water and subsequently through the second heat exchanger which is provided for heating of the fresh air before it is furnished to the preceding drying zone.According to a fourth embodiment of the method of the present invention, it is also possible to direct the hot air taken from the hood first through the second heat exchanger which is provided to heat the fresh air, and subsequently through the first heat exchanger which is provided for heating the condensate and/or fresh water, before it is furnished to the preceding drying zone.The inventive machine for the production of a fibrous web, especially a cardboard, paper or tissue web is configured such that, for the production of at least a portion of the steam for the preceding drying zone, a first heat exchanger is provided which is furnished with hot air, for example exhaust air from the hood allocated to the drying cylinder of the downstream drying zone, in order to heat condensate and/or fresh water occurring in the drying cylinder of the downstream drying zone by means of this hot air taken from the hood; and/or in order to produce at least a portion of the hot, moist air for the preceding dying zone, the hot air taken from the hood and directed through the first heat exchanger is fed to the preceding drying zone.According to a first embodiment of the inventive machine, the preceding drying zone includes a suction-equipped device, for example a suction roll over which the fibrous web is guided, together with a least one permeable belt, such as a structured fabric or through air drying (TAD) fabric, whereby steam or respectively hot, moist air flows first through the permeable belt and subsequently through the fibrous web.The fibrous web may be covered by at least one additional permeable belt, for example a press belt, whereby steam or respectively hot, moist air first flows through the additional permeable belt or respectively press belt, then through the first permeable belt or respectively structured fabric and subsequently through the fibrous web. When using a press belt, a type of belt press is created whereby, in addition to the mechanical pressure, in particular combined hot air and steam drying is applied.In addition, a dewatering belt, for example a felt belt, can be directed over the suction equipped device or respectively the suction roll, together with the fibrous web, whereby steam or respectively hot, moist air first flows through the additional permeable belt or respectively the press belt, if present, then through the first permeable belt, or respectively the structured fabric, and the fibrous web and finally through the additional dewatering belt.Steam, produced from the furnished condensate and/or fresh water can be provided directly to the preceding drying zone by means of the first heat exchanger. As already mentioned it is, however, also conceivable to initially merely heat the condensate and/or fresh water by means of the first heat exchanger and to furnish the condensate and/or fresh water so heated by this first heat exchanger to a flash-evaporation device. In this case the steam produced through flash evaporation is fed to the preceding drying zone.The appropriate evaporation system may also include one or several pumps for circulation of the water. With these pumps in particular, a higher pressure of the water circulating within the first heat exchanger can be achieved, whereby this pressure can be in a range of approximately 3 to approximately 20 bar. The water absorbs heat from the air which was directed through the heat exchanger and its surface tension is then lowered.In the hereby occurring flash evaporation the water pressure is reduced, thus producing steam. The water with the higher pressure evaporates at a higher temperature. If the water is maintained at a higher pressure then its temperature may be raised without evaporation. If the pressure is then reduced to a value which possesses a boiling temperature below the previous temperature the flash process begins automatically.The generated steam can be precipitated in a suitable chamber and can be used for the subsequent drying process, for example in tissue production.A second heat exchanger may be provided in order to heat the fresh air with the hot air taken from the hood, whereby the thus heated fresh air is furnished as combustion air and/or make-up air to the hood allocated to the drying cylinder of the downstream drying zone. As already mentioned, “make-up air” is to be understood to be air, for example, for pre-heating of the drying zone and/or the drying system. Pre-heating is done, for example, during start-up of the tissue machine.The current invention provides advantages, especially in regard to steam consumption, for example when using a Yankee-dryer and/or a belt press. The generated volume of steam depends on conditions such as air mass flow, air temperature and moisture, on whether or not an air/air-heat exchanger is provided, etc.At least one heat exchanger with, for example, a flow-regulated bypass, may be provided for the hot air which is taken from the hood.Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views. The exemplifications set out herein illustrate embodiments of the invention and such exemplifications are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner.Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , there is shown a schematic flow diagram of a first embodiment of the inventive heat recovery system of a machine for the production of a fibrous web, in particular a cardboard, paper or tissue web. The moving fibrous web is acted upon by steam, as well as hot, moist air in the region of preceding drying zone . Subsequently, the fibrous web is fed into downstream drying zone . Preceding drying zone  may hereby include, for example, suction-equipped device , such as a suction roll over which the fibrous web is guided, together with a least one permeable belt, in particular a structured fabric or TAD-fabric, whereby steam or respectively hot, moist air flow first through the permeable belt and then through the fibrous web.The fibrous web can moreover be covered by at least one additional permeable belt, for example a press belt, whereby in this case steam or respectively hot, moist air first flow through the additional permeable belt or respectively press belt, then through the first permeable belt, or respectively structured fabric, and subsequently through the fibrous web. When using a press belt a type of belt press is created whereby, in addition to the mechanical pressure, in particular combined hot air and steam drying is applied.In addition, a dewatering belt, for example a felt belt, can be directed over suction equipped device  or respectively the suction roll, together with the fibrous web, whereby steam or respectively hot, moist air first flow through the additional permeable belt or respectively the press belt, if present, then through the first permeable belt or respectively the structured fabric and the fibrous web and subsequently through the additional dewatering belt.Downstream drying zone  may include drying cylinder , for example a Yankee-cylinder, as well as hood  allocated to same which can be a hot air hood.Hot air , for example exhaust air, is taken from hood  allocated to drying cylinder . To generate at least a portion of the steam for preceding drying zone , condensate and/or fresh water occurring in drying cylinder  of downstream drying zone  is heated by hot air  taken from hood  by means of first heat exchanger .To produce at least a portion of the hot, moist air for preceding drying zone , hot air  taken from hood  and directed though first heat exchanger  is furnished to preceding drying zone . Since hot air  gives off heat to condensate  or respectively to fresh water, their temperature is lowered, so that moist hot air ′ eventually furnished to preceding drying zone  possesses a temperature suitable for the special drying process in drying zone . Hot air  furnished to heat exchanger  can, for example, have a temperature in the range of approximately 360° C. and moist hot air ′ eventually furnished to preceding drying zone  can have a temperature in the range of approximately 200° C. Condensate  supplied to heat exchanger  can, for example, have a temperature in the range of for example 165° C.In the present example, steam  is produced immediately from supplied condensate  and/or fresh water by means of first heat exchanger  and is then furnished to preceding drying zone .As can be seen in , steam separator  can moreover be provided which is located between cylinder  and pump , through which condensate  is supplied to heat exchanger .

Heat exchanger  is an air/water heat exchanger.Referring now to , there is shown a schematic flow diagram of a second embodiment of the heat recovery system of the present invention which differs from the embodiment illustrated in  essentially in that fresh air  is heated by hot air  taken from hood  by means of second heat exchanger  and the thus heated fresh air ′ is furnished as combustion air to hood  which is allocated to drying cylinder  of downstream drying zone . Second heat exchanger  therefore is an air/air-heat exchanger.In the present example, hot air  taken from hood  is first directed through second heat exchanger , which is provided for heating fresh air , and then through the first heat exchanger , which is provided for heating condensate  and fresh air, before it is furnished to preceding drying zone .In principle however, an embodiment is, for example, also possible where extracted hot air  is first directed through first heat exchanger , which is provided for heating condensate  and/or fresh water, and then through second heat exchange  which is provided for heating fresh air , before it is furnished to preceding drying zone .Referring now to , there is shown a schematic flow diagram of a third embodiment of the heat recovery system of the present invention which differs from the embodiment illustrated in  essentially in that condensate  and/or fresh water is heated by first heat exchanger  under increased pressure which, for example, is in the range of approximately 3 bar to approximately 20 bar and in that condensate  and/or fresh water which is heated by means of first heat exchanger  and which is under increased pressure is then furnished to a flash evaporation device.

                "The invention relates to a method for the drying of goods, in particular for the convection drying of pastas, the goods being introduced from a first treatment zone into a second treatment zone. The invention relates, furthermore, to an apparatus for the drying of goods, in particular for the convection drying of pastas, having at least two treatment zones through which the goods are transported.Pastas, in particular long products, such as, for example, spaghetti, leave a press head in the form of soft moistly plastic dough strands and are led, suspended, through differently heated treatment zones up to final drying and, after the conclusion of the drying operation, are introduced into a stabilization zone, a moistening zone or a cooling zone and dimensionally stabilized. During the drying operation, the extraction of water from the pastas is to be controlled such that drying proceeds from the outside inward, so that the surface does not harden before the core in order to avoid cracks and clefts in the finished pasta. That is to say, the surface should not harden before the core, and the moisture gradient between the layers is to remain limited. The drying of the formed long products is the last and the technically most demanding section in the production of long products. Drying at too high an air temperature, with too low relative atmospheric moisture and with excessive air circulation causes shrinkage stresses which may later give rise to cracks, clefts and breaks and also disintegration of the dry pastas or disintegration during cooking.For the drying of pastas, convection dryers are used in practice, the drying conditions, that is to say the temperature and relative moisture of the drying medium (air), varying over the dryer length. The dryer is subdivided into treatment zones. Apparatuses constructed in this way consume a large amount of energy and time for the drying process. Since the treatment zones are set up in a line, the plants for this drying process require very large installation areas in the production spaces.A method of this type is also known from the document EP 0 129 892 B1. A drying plant is composed of a first treatment zone, a rapid heating zone, having a first treatment zone or climate zone in which the product is heated as quickly as possible. This is followed by a transpiration period lasting several hours, in which the residual water is distributed uniformly from the core of the product over the entire cross section. The subsequent drying takes place more slowly and more carefully than the predrying in a second treatment zone, an intensive drying zone, having a second climate zone. The product is heated in the first treatment zone for a duration of between 15 and 30 minutes, and under the action of a heating medium with a relative moisture of 60 to 85%, to a temperature of more than 80° C. In the second treatment zone, the product is dried under the action of a drying medium with a temperature of more than 80° C. and with a relative moisture of 65 to 85% to a moisture content of about 14% by weight. To avoid undesirable reactions, the product may first be dried at more than 80° C. to a moisture content of less than 18% by weight and then at a low temperature to a final moisture content of less than 14% by weight. In this drying method, however, the pasta to be dried is not in a rubber-like state over the entire cross section, but only in the core, while the surface of the pasta is already in a glass-like state during the drying operation. A relatively long stabilization phase is therefore necessary in order to reduce moisture gradients or stresses in the pastas which have occurred. This necessitates an additional prolongation of the production time.The document DE 44 24 846 A1 discloses a dryer for plastic granulate, in which the dry supply air, before entering a reservoir, is led past a heat exchanger. The heated and moisture-laden return air flowing into a return air line transmits part of the heat via the heat exchanger to the supply air. A heating device heats the dry air to the temperature required for the drying operation, before it enters the reservoir which already contains the goods to be dried. The return air flowing into the return air line heats the dry air delivered via the dry supply air line, so that correspondingly less heating energy has to be supplied via the heating device. The structural set-up of this apparatus allows only restricted heat recovery.The object on which the invention is based is to improve a method and an apparatus of the generic type initially mentioned, to the effect that the dryer is constructed in a structurally simple, cost-effective and space-saving way and the drying process can be conducted efficiently.This object is achieved, according to the invention, by means of a method having the features of claim .On the average, the temperature is lower over the first treatment zone than in the second treatment zone, and the energy obtained from the exhaust air of the first and/or the second treatment zone in at least one heat exchanger arranged outside the treatment zones is introduced at least partially into the first treatment zone. As a result, in terms of the thermal heating capacity, an energy saving for the entire drying method of approximately 60% is possible, as compared with the conventional method. Furthermore, this drying method affords the advantage that the drying of the goods, particularly the convection drying of pastas, proceeds from the outside inward such that the surface does not harden before the core and therefore cracks and clefts in the goods are avoided.The entire surface of the pastas to be dried preferably remains in a rubber-like state. As a result, not only the extent of shrinkage stresses, but also the occurrence of Maillard reactions during the drying operation can be reduced. See, in this respect, also patent applications DE 10 2008 002 334 and WO 2009/150192 by the same applicant, which are incorporated in the present description by reference. This has an especially positive effect upon the cooking properties and discolorations of the pastas.In the method, described in WO 2009/150192, for the drying of pastas, the pastas present as raw dough structures pass during the drying operation through states on the surface which have different pairs of values of the temperature of the surface and the moisture of the surface. In this case, the temperature of the surface of the raw dough structure can lie not more than 40° C. above the temperature on the glass transition curve of the raw dough at the point of equal moisture of the surface. Correspondingly, in the method according to the invention, too, the temperature in the second treatment zone can lie not more than 40° C. above the temperature on the glass transition curve at the point of equal moisture of the surfaces. Even with this restriction in temperature, it is beneficial to introduce into the first treatment zone the energy which has been obtained by means of the heat exchanger.Advantageously, a drying medium, in particular air, in the first and/or the second treatment zone is led past at least one heat exchanger arranged in the treatment zone and is heated. This drying medium dries the goods which are introduced from a first treatment zone into the second treatment zone. The heat exchanger makes it possible to transfer the energy obtained from other method steps to the drying medium. This leads to an energy saving in the method as a whole.It is conceivable that the goods are led through more than two treatment zones in order to adapt the drying process to specific requirements.In a beneficial exemplary embodiment, in the first treatment zone, in the product flow direction, the temperature of the drying medium can rise, the temperature of the goods and the absolute moisture of the drying medium can rise and the water content of the goods can fall. Minor jumps in temperature within the treatment zone can prevent the pastas to be dried from sticking together.In a further embodiment, in the second treatment zone, in the product flow direction, the temperature of the drying medium can be varied, the temperature, in particular, rising. Furthermore, the temperature of the goods and the absolute moisture of the drying medium can rise, and the water content of the goods can fall. By the temperature of the drying medium being adapted, it is possible, during the entire drying process, to keep the pastas to be dried within a temperature range optimal for fulfilling the quality requirements.In an especially advantageous embodiment of the present invention, a higher temperature may prevail at the end of the first treatment zone than at the start of the first treatment zone. Furthermore, a lower or equally high or higher temperature may prevail at the end of the second treatment zone than at the start of the second treatment zone. This procedure ensures a process for drying the pastas which is aimed at the product quality. A different temperature profile may be employed, depending on the desired product quality (color, cooking properties, etc.), on the type and nature of the raw materials used (hard semolina, soft wheat flour, etc.) and on the additives administered (eggs, tomato powder, spinach powder, etc.).In order to recover the heat energy in the treatment zones, the at least one heat exchanger in the first treatment zone may be supplied with water which is heated via at least one heat exchanger by the exhaust air of the first and/or the second treatment zone. Especially efficient energy recovery within the process is thereby possible.It is conceivable to admix conventionally heated, that is to say hotter water to the water which is supplied to the heat exchangers in the first and/or the second treatment zone, in order thereby to increase the heat transferred to the drying medium by the heat exchangers in the treatment zones. The temperature in the respective regions of the treatment zones rises as a result.It is conceivable that the energy present in the first and/or the second treatment zone heats the feed water required for dough preparation and/or further zones of the dryer, in particular of a hanger. There is therefore no need for the external supply of energy in these regions.In a further embodiment of the present invention, the goods leaving the main dryer may be introduced into a stabilization zone and/or moistening zone and/or cooling zone. In these zones, the goods, in particular pastas, can be prepared optimally for the subsequent storage process.The inner heat exchangers arranged in the first and/or the second treatment zone are connected in series and have a fluid, in particular water, flowing through them counter to the product flow direction. The temperature of the last regions of the treatment zones in the product flow direction then has a higher temperature than the first regions. That is to say, the goods likewise have higher temperatures in these regions.The temperature jumps between areas in the first and/or the second treatment zone are only small and are assigned to the successive heat exchangers in the treatment zones. In particular, these temperature jumps are no greater than 12° C., preferably no greater than 8° C., and especially preferably no greater than 4° C. The small temperature jumps prevent the goods led through the treatment zones from sticking together during the drying process.The fresh air supplied to the second treatment zone may be extracted at least partially from the exhaust air of the first treatment zone. The exhaust air is preferably sucked away from the first treatment zone at its end, since it has the highest temperature in this area and there is a high potential for recovering this energy. By the exhaust air being sucked away from the first treatment zone, the relative atmospheric moisture at least in the last area of the first treatment zone in the product flow direction is regulated or controlled.At least in the last area of the second treatment zone in the product flow direction, the relative atmospheric moisture may be regulated and/or controlled. This may take place by the exhaust air being sucked away from the second treatment zone.The object initially mentioned is achieved, furthermore, by means of an apparatus having the features of claim .At least one heat exchanger is arranged in each case in the first and/or in the second and/or in the plurality of treatment zones. This heat exchanger is a water/air heat exchanger. The heat exchangers arranged in the treatment zones make it possible to transfer the energy recovered from the exhaust air or wastewater by means of heat exchangers arranged outside the treatment zones into the drying process. A major saving of the energy to be supplied from outside for the drying process is thereby achieved.In an especially advantageous embodiment of the invention, the first of the two treatment zones is a heating zone and the second treatment zone is a drying zone. The goods to be dried experience in these two zones different treatment temperatures which can be adapted to the required product quality.The first and/or the second treatment zone may have in each case at least one heat exchanger or a plurality of inner heat exchangers arranged in series. The heat exchangers transfer the heat recovered from the drying processes to the drying medium. A plurality of heat exchangers arranged in series make it possible to have optimally small temperature jumps from one heat exchanger to the next heat exchanger, with the result that the pastas can be prevented from sticking together in this region of the drying process.In a beneficial embodiment, at least one outer heat exchanger may follow the first and/or the second treatment zone, in order to absorb the heat or energy present in the treatment zone and enable it to be recovered.In a variant of the invention, the exhaust air discharged from the first treatment zone and/or the second treatment zone may be processed in the outer heat exchanger or outer heat exchangers, the energy obtained in the heat exchanger being recirculatable into the inner heat exchanger or inner heat exchangers of the first and/or the second treatment zone. The outer heat exchanger thus makes it possible to recover the energy present in the treatment zones. The energy saving in the plant as a whole can thereby be increased by means of the recovery of heat.The apparatus is advantageously designed in such a way that the fresh air to be supplied to the second treatment zone can be extracted from the exhaust air of the first treatment zone. The exhaust air is preferably sucked away from the end of the first treatment zone, since it has the highest temperature here and allows the greatest possible energy recovery.By the exhaust air being sucked away from the first treatment zone, the relative atmospheric moisture at least in the last area of the first treatment zone in the product flow direction can be regulated and/or controlled.Further advantages for energy recovery arise when the relative atmospheric moisture at least in the last area of the second treatment zone in the product flow direction can be regulated and/or controlled by the exhaust air being sucked away from the second treatment zone.Further advantageous developments of the invention are defined in the subclaims.A preferred embodiment of the present invention is now explained with the aid of the figure,  showing a conceptual sketch of the apparatus.The present invention makes it possible to dry pastas while their entire cross section is in a rubber-like state, the glass transition temperature of wheat starch and wheat protein in the pastas being taken into account. This glass transition temperature describes a range in which the transition from the rubber-like to the glass-like state takes place. During the method, the parameters of the drying conditions are selected such that the surfaces of the pastas also remain in the rubber-like state during the entire drying process. Drying can thereby be accelerated, since the moisture diffusion of the water bound in the pastas is higher in the rubber-like state than the in glass-like state. Moreover, the stabilization phase following the drying process can be shortened, since the stresses in the pastas can be broken down more effectively in the rubber-like state.The method for the drying of goods, in particular for the convection drying of pastas, takes place in a dryer  which is composed of at least two treatment zones , . The first treatment zone  is a heating zone and the second treatment zone  is a main dryer. Furthermore, the dryer has a stabilization zone, a moistening zone and a cooling zone. Inside the treatment zones ,  are arranged a plurality of heat exchangers ,  which are designated hereafter by the “heat exchangers”. The heat exchangers arranged outside the treatment zones ,  in the apparatus  are designated by “heat exchangers” , , , , , .In the dryer , long products, that is to say spaghetti, are dried, which, after leaving a press head, are led on a bar hanger device through the dryer . In the first treatment zone , the heating zone, the pastas are heated and dried continuously from approximately 40° C. and approximately 28% HO to approximately 70 to 90° C. and preferably to 75° C. and 20% HO. This heating zone  has a plurality of water/air heat exchangers, hereafter heat exchangers , in series, with the result that the drying medium, for example air, continuously following the product flow F, is heated continuously from approximately 42° C. and 80% relative moisture to approximately 80° C. and 80% relative moisture. Small temperature jumps are made possible by the plurality of heat exchangers  arranged in series.The forward run of the heating zone , that is to say the heating water upstream of the water/air heat exchangers  of the last element or area of the heating zone  in the product conveying direction F, has the highest temperature. This temperature lies between 75 and 95° C. and preferably at approximately 84° C. This temperature is furnished by a plurality of energy streams:The heating water flows through the heating zone , counter to the product flow F, through the water/air heat exchangers  which are connected in series. A plurality of fans  move the drying medium, the air, which is heated continuously by the series-connected heat exchangers . The heat exchangers  are dimensioned such that the required heating capacity can be exchanged by means of minor temperature differences between the water and air. The series connection of the heat exchangers gives rise, in the case of a small flow of water, to a high temperature difference of the heating water. This affords a relatively low return run temperature.The required fresh air is preferably sucked directly out of a hanger into the dryer . Since, at the end of the heating zone , part of the exhaust air is sucked away from the dryer  in a regulated way, the relative atmospheric moisture in the last area is regulated. The water for heating the heating zone  is constantly circulated by means of a pump . The temperature in the last area of the heating zone , that is to say at the end of the product flow direction F, can be regulated by the extraction of cold water and by the admixture of hot water. The air temperature in the first area of the heating zone , that is to say at the start of the heating zone  in the product flow direction F, is regulated by a change in the through-flow rate through the heat exchangers , a water pump  with a frequency converter preferably being used.During the drying method, the pastas are introduced from a first treatment zone  into a second treatment zone , the second treatment zone being the main dryer . The temperature in the first treatment zone, that is to say the heating zone , is on average lower than in the second treatment zone . The goods to be dried pass at a temperature of approximately 75° C. and 20% HO into the main dryer , in which they are heated and dried continuously to approximately 86° C. and 12% HO.The main dryer  has a plurality of water/air heat exchangers  which are connected in series and through which the heating water flows counter to the product flow F. A plurality of fans  move the drying medium, the air, which is heated continuously by the series-connected heat exchangers . Small temperature jumps from one fan  to the next are advantageous, thus preventing the goods to be dried from sticking together, since minor temperature differences between the product temperature and the dew point occur in the following area of the dryer .The heating water led into the main dryer  is generated from two streams:The heat exchangers  in the second treatment zone, the main dryer , are dimensioned such that the required heating capacity can be exchanged by means of minor temperature differences between the water and air. The heating water flows, counter to the product flow F, at a temperature of between 80 and 120° C., preferably 102° C., through the series-connected water/air heat exchangers  of the main dryer . The drying medium, following the product flow F, is thereby heated continuously in the main dryer  from approximately 82° C. and 80% relative moisture to approximately 97° C. and 64% relative moisture. The series connection of the heat exchangers gives rise, in the case of a small flow of water, to a high temperature difference of the heating water. A relatively low return run temperature is thereby obtained.The required fresh air is sucked directly out of the preceding heating zone  into the main dryer . At the end of the main dryer , the exhaust air is sucked away from the dryer ,  in a regulated way. The relative atmospheric moisture in the last area is thereby regulated. The heating water of the main dryer  is constantly circulated by means of a pump . The air temperature in the last element of the main dryer  is regulated by the extraction of cold water and the admixture of hot water. The air temperature in the first element of the main dryer  is regulated by a change in the through-flow rate through the heat exchangers  by means of a water pump  having a frequency converter.In the apparatus according to the invention, heat recovery takes place in two stages. In the first stage, an air/water heat exchanger  is built into the return run of the water heating circuit of the heating zone . The exhaust air from the heating zone  and the main dryer  is conducted through this heat exchanger  and, by atmospheric moisture being condensed out, discharges heat for the most part to the heating water of the heating zone. Part of the heating capacity (approximately 70%) of the heating zone  is thereby recovered from the exhaust air in an unregulated way. The return run water is heated from approximately 46° C. to approximately 72° C. via the heat exchanger  by the exhaust air of the main dryer.For heat recovery in the second stage, an additional water heating circuit is set up and circulated by means of an additional pump . To feed this heating circuit, an air/water heat exchanger  is built into the exhaust air line of the main dryer . This heat exchanger , too, utilizes mainly the condensation energy from the exhaust air. The forward run of the heating water in this circuit reaches approximately 84° C. in an unregulated way. By means of this water, the return run of the heating zone  is heated further from approximately 72° C. to approximately 80° C. in a regulated way via a water/water heat exchanger . In addition, by means of this circuit, the feed water for dough preparation is heated in a regulated way to the desired temperature with the aid of a water/water heat exchanger . The energy introduction required hitherto for heating the feed water is therefore dispensed with.In addition, by means of this water heating circuit, the fresh air for the ventilation hood of the hanger is preheated in a regulated way. For this purpose, two additional water/air heat exchangers ,  are provided, so that only about ¼ of the conventional amount of energy introduced has to be supplied from outside for the ventilation hood.The return run of all the heat exchangers , ,  is mixed together again and pumped through the exhaust air heat exchanger .By virtue of the method and apparatus according to the invention, an energy saving in the overall plant  of approximately 60% can be achieved in terms of thermal heating capacity by the recovery of heat. The cost-effective components, such as, for example, heat exchangers, have small overall sizes, and they can therefore be integrated into the complete drying plant  in a simple way. As a result of the compact structural set-up of the plant, a small amount of space is required at the production location and only one exhaust air system is necessary. Furthermore, only one fresh air supply system is necessary for both drying zones, with the result that there is less pipework for the plant."

Although various embodiments described herein are discussed in the context of tightening a shoe, the lacing system disclosed herein can likewise be used to tighten other objects, including but not limited to gloves, hats, belts, braces, boots, jackets, pants, or other wearable articles. The lacing system  can include a mechanism for imparting and/or holding tension on a lace. For example, the lacing system  can include a lace winder  configured to draw a lace  into the lace winder  as a knob of the lace winder  is twisted. The lace winder  can be positioned on the back of the shoe, as is shown in , or on the side or tongue of the shoe , or in any other suitable position that allows the lace  to be fed into and out of the lace winder . In some embodiments, the lacing system  may include more than one lace winder or other mechanism for holding the tension on the lace or may not include any such mechanism.The lace  used with the lacing system  can be a variety of different lace types. In some embodiments, the lace can be made of stranded steel cable with no coating, stranded steel cable with a polymer coating (e.g., nylon coating), monofilament (e.g., nylon), or braided Spectra®. Preferably, the lace  has a modulus of elasticity of at least about 20,000 psi and/or no more than about 1,000,000 psi. The lace  can have a diameter of at least about 0.015 inches and preferably no more than about 0.1 inches, although diameters outside these ranges can also be used. In some embodiments the lace  can have a diameter of about 0.03 inches.The lacing system can include one or more lace guides  configured to guide the lace  through the lacing system  so that the sides of the shoe  or other article are drawn together when the lace  tightened by, for example, the lace winder . The lace guides  can be configured to reduce or minimize friction thereby substantially evenly distribute the force imposed by the tightened lace  along the lacing zone, thereby avoiding pressure points which can cause discomfort and impaired performance. The guides  can provide a lace path that resists allowing the lace  to turn about any sharp corners of less than about a 5 mm radius when the lace  is tightened. In some embodiments, the guides can provide a lace path that includes no corners of less than about a 3 mm radius, or no corners of less than about a 7 mm radius, or no corners of less than about a 10 mm radius, although curvatures outside of these ranges are also possible.The reduction or elimination of sharp turns from the lace path can prevent fatigue of the lace  and can reduce the friction and wear on lace  and on the guides  as well. Removing sharp turns from the lace path can be increasingly advantageous in embodiments where laces of larger diameters, and harder, less flexible, materials are used. In some embodiments, harder and less flexible laces (e.g., steel cable laces) can allow for increased tension to be applied to the lacing system. The lacing system  can be configured to tighten with about 2.5 pounds of force in some embodiments, although a much higher tension of up to about 100 pounds can be used in some embodiments (e.g., snowboard boots). When the force is concentrated on a smaller lace thickness, and the force is not significantly absorbed by a softer lace material, and the force is not significantly absorbed by stretching of the lace, it can be particularly advantageous to avoid sharp turns in the lace path.In some embodiments, a hidden portion of the lace guides  can be disposed under a portion of the article such that the hidden portion is hidden or substantially hidden from view, and an exposed portion of the lace guides  can be disposed on the exterior of the article such that the exposed portion is visible. For example, in some embodiments, the one or more of the lace guides  can include a lace channel  that is disposed under a portion of the shoe or other article. In some embodiments, the covering portion of the shoe or article is opaque or substantially opaque and substantially hides the channel .  is another view of the lacing system  and shoe  with the lace channels  shown schematically by dotted lines that follow the path of the lace  through the lace guides . In some embodiments, one or more of the lace guides  can include an end piece  positioned at the end of a lace channel  such that the end piece  is positioned on the exterior of the article where it is exposed and visible.Disposing a portion of the lace guides  within the shoe can provide the shoe with a more aesthetically pleasing appearance, can protect portions of the lace guides  from damage, can prevent items from becoming snagged on external lace guides (especially during sports activities), can allow for the use of deeper lace paths that more accurately follow the natural curvature of the lace , and can permit the use of softer materials for some or all of the lace guide . In some embodiments, the exposed end pieces  of the lace guides  can have an appearance similar to conventional shoelace eyelets which can be a desirable aesthetic feature. In some embodiments, the end pieces  can be have a non-uniform flange extending around at least a portion of the openings to the lace channels . The end pieces can be, for example, substantially bell-shaped and can provide a curved sliding surface for the lace  to ride against as it is tightened, to prevent the lace  from turning a tight corner as it enters or exits the lace guide  and reduce friction and wear on the lace  and on the lace guide . Thus, some embodiments provide the appearance of spaced apart eyelets while still providing a structured lace channel between the eyelets.In some instances, the lacing system  can use one or more double-end-piece lace guides For example, as can be seen in , a double-end-piece lace guide can have a generally U-shaped lace channel  that connects a first opening and a second opening and each of the first and second openings -can have an exposed end piece  attached thereto. In some embodiments, the end pieces  are spaced away from the edges of the shoe that are drawn together by the lacing system. By spacing the lace guides  away from the edges, tension applied to the lace  can be more evenly distributed than if the openings to the lace guides were positioned directly on or adjacent to the edges. Distributing the tension from the opening to the edge may facilitate movement of the edge across the tongue, reducing the likelihood of tongue bunching.In some instances, the lacing system  can use one or more single-end-piece lace guides A single-end-piece lace guide can have a lace channel  with a first opening that includes an exposed end piece , while the second opening at the other end of the lace channel  does not include an exposed end piece . The unexposed opening can, for example, direct the lace  toward the lace winder , as is the case in .is a top-front perspective view of a double-end-piece lace guide .  is a bottom-rear perspective view of the lace guide . The lace guide  can include a lace channel  with a first opening  at a first end of the lace channel  and a second opening  as a second end of the lace channel . In the illustrated embodiment, the lace channel  is generally U-shaped, although the lace channel  can follow a path having other shapes. For example, the lace channel  can be generally linear, or generally S-shaped, etc. A first end piece  can be positioned at the first opening  and a second end piece  can be positioned at the second opening . The end pieces ,  can be generally bell-shaped, as shown in the illustrated embodiments, but other shapes can also be used. The lace guide  can include a stitch flange , which can, for example, have a middle portion that extends between portions of the lace channel , a first end portion that extends away from the lace channel  in a first direction, and a second end portion that extends away from the lace channel  in a second direction.In some embodiments, the lace guide  can be formed as a single integral piece. Various materials and processes can be used to form the lace guide . For example, the lace guide can be injection molded or otherwise formed from any suitable polymeric material, such as nylon, PVC or PET. In some embodiments, at least some portions of the lace guide  can be can be formed from a lubricious plastic such as PTFE, or other material useful in reducing the friction between a lace and portions of the lace guide configured to interact with the lace. In some embodiments, portions of the lace guide  can be coated, impregnated, blended, or layered with a lubricious material to reduce the friction with interacting components or parts. In some embodiments, the lace guide  can be formed from a material that is generally rigid or semi-rigid. In some embodiments, the lace guide  can be generally flexible, so that it can conform to the shape of a shoe (or other article) associated with the lace guide , especially in cases in which the shoe may bend when in use.In some embodiments, the lace channel  can have an open bottom.  is a cross-sectional view of the lace guide  taken through a midline through the lace guide . The lace channel  can include a main channel  that is configured to receive a lace, and an open channel  that provides an opening from the main channel  to the exterior of the lace guide  via the open bottom  and can facilitate and can facilitate the manufacture thereof. In some embodiments, open channel  can be thinner than the main channel . For example, the open channel  can be thinner than the lace received by the main channel  such that the lace does not exit the lace channel  via the open channel  or become wedged in the open channel . In some embodiments, the open channel  can be at least about 0.5 mm wide, and/or no more than about 1.5 mm wide, and in some instances can be about 1.0 mm wide, although other dimensions outside of these ranges can be used, especially depending on the diameter of the lace to be used. The main channel  can be at least about 1.0 mm wide, and/or no more than about 3.0 wide, and in some instances can be about 2.0 mm wide, although other dimensions outside of these ranges can be used, especially depending on the diameter of the lace to be used. In some embodiments, the main channel  can be about twice as wide as the open channel . In some embodiments, the main channel  may vary in size from one opening to the other.A back undercut  can be formed at the transition from the main channel  to the open channel  on the back side of the lace channel . The back undercut  can be curved as shown, or it can be an angled step. The back undercut  can facilitate the initial threading of the lace through the lace channel , for example, by preventing the lace from dropping down into the open channel . A front undercut  can be formed at the transition between the main channel  and the open channel  on the front side of the lace channel . The front undercut  can aid in keeping the lace in proper position in the main channel  when tightened. In some embodiments, the front undercut , the back undercut , and/or both may be eliminated along some or all of the lace channel .The open bottom  of the lace guide  can facilitate the molding of the lace guide . The lace guide , or at least the lace channel  portion thereof, can be injection molded with an insert piece used to form the main channel  and the open channel . The insert piece can have a wider top portion and a narrower lower portion that correspond to the wider main channel  and narrower open channel . Once the lace guide  is molded, the insert piece can be removed from the lace channel  by applying a force that pulls the insert piece out through the open bottom . In some embodiments, the walls of the lace channel  can flex as the wide top portion of the insert piece passes through the narrow open channel .To facilitate removal of the insert piece, in some embodiments, the lace guide , or at least the lace channel  portion thereof, can be made of a somewhat soft or flexible material. However, in some embodiments, a material is used that is hard enough to withstand the tension applied by the lacing system without damaging the lace guide  or tearing out stitches or other fasteners that attach the lace guide  to the shoe. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the lace guide , or at least the portions of the lace guide  that contact the lace during use, can be formed from a material that is softer than the outer surface of the lace. Thus, after repeated use, the softer material of the lace guide  will wear before the outer surface of the lace. This can be advantageous in some embodiments because wearing out the outer surface of the lace can expose the inner layers of the lace and can weaken the lace or give the appearance that integrity of the lace has been compromised even when it hasn't. If the lace guide  is made of a material that is softer than the outer surface of the lace, then lace guide  will tend to wear down instead of the lace thereby preserving lace integrity and the appearance thereof. Because some of the contact points between the lace guide  and the lace are inside the lace channel , the worn portion of the lace guide can be hidden from view. In some embodiments, a material can be used to form the lace guide that has a hardness of at least about 60 Shore D and/or no more than about 85 Shore D, although other hardness values can also be used. In some embodiments, different portions of the lace guide  can have different levels of hardness. For example, in some embodiments, the stitch flange  can be formed from a harder material that the lace channel , for example, by overmolding the stitch flange over the lace channel . A differential of 5 to 25 Shore D could be advantageous. Thus, the lace channel  can be configured to bend and flex with the shoe (or other article) during use, while the stitch flange  can remain relatively rigid to hold the lace guide  in place. The harder material of the stitch flange  can also reduce the likelihood that stitches will tear through the stitch flange .In some embodiments, the lace guide  can be formed from multiple pieces. For example, the lace channel  can be formed as a separate piece than the end pieces ,  which can be attached to the ends of the lace channel  using an adhesive, sonic welding, a snap fit structure, or any other suitable attachment method.shows an exploded perspective view of another embodiment of a double-end-piece lace guide , which in some ways can be similar to, or the same as, the lace guide , or any other lace guide disclosed herein. The lace guide  can be a two part construction formed from an upper portion  and a lower portion . The upper portion  can include an upper lace channel portion and upper portions of the first and second end pieces The lower portion  can include a lower portion of the lace channel and lower portions of the first and second end pieces In some embodiments, the end pieces can be formed as complete integral pieces with the lower portion  such that the upper portion  includes only the top of the lace channelThe upper portion  can be attached to the lower portion  by an adhesive, sonic welding, a snap fit connection, or any other suitable type of connection or fastener. In some embodiments, the upper portion  and the lower portion  can include tabs  and corresponding holes  to facilitate the alignment and attachment of the upper portion  and the lower portion .A main channel  can be configured to receive a lace that passes through the lace guide . An upper portion of the main channel (hidden from view in ) can be formed in the bottom surface of the upper portion , and a lower portion of the main channel can be formed in the top surface of the lower portion . Because the upper and lower portions ,  can be molded separately, the main channel  can be made without having an open bottom. When the lace guide  is assembled, the main channel  can be fully enclosed except for the first and second openings , . This can reduce the occurrence of the lace becoming wedged in the open channel, and the ingress of debris into the channel.Referring again to , other two part constructions are possible. For example a lace guide can be formed has an open bottom lace channel similar to that shown in the lace guide , and a second piece can attach to the lace guide to fill the open channel , thereby forming a main channel  that is enclosed except for the first and second openings , .is a cross-sectional view of the lace guide  taken at a midpoint through the opening . The channel  can define an axis E which passes through the center of the opening  and extends in the direction of a tangent line to the curvature of the lace channel  at the opening . In some embodiments, the end piece  can include a flange extending generally radially (with respect to the axis E extending out of the lace channel  via the opening ) away from the main channel . The flange can have a diameter  that is larger than an outer diameter  of the lace channel , thereby forming a ridge or step  that extends around the flange. The flange can have an upper flange portion  and a lower flange portion . As shown, the lower flange portion  can extend axially (with respect to the axis E extending out of the lace channel  via the opening ) out away from the lace channel  further than does the upper flange portion . In some embodiments, a line A drawn from the outer end of the lower flange portion  to the outer end of the upper flange portion  can be offset from a line B drawn parallel to the lace channel  (or parallel to the main channel  therein) by an angle . The angle  can be at least about 5° and/or no more than about 85°, at least about 10° and/or no more than about 80°, at least about 15° and/or no more than about 75°, at least about 30° and/or no more than about 60°, or about 45°, although angles outside of these ranges can also be used.The upper flange portion  can be more curved than the lower flange portion . In some embodiments, the upper flange portion  can have a radius of curvature of at least about 1.0 millimeter because the lace will generally not ride against this surface and/or of no more than about 3.0 millimeters, or of about 2.0 millimeters, although curvatures outside of these ranges can be used. In some embodiments, the lower flange portion  can have a radius of curvature of at least about 4.0 millimeters and/or no of more than about 15.0 millimeters, or of about 10.0 millimeters, although curvatures outside of these ranges can be used. In some embodiments, the curvature of the generally bell-shaped end piece  can vary gradually from the least curved portion  to the most curved portion . In some embodiments, the end piece  is not rotationally symmetrical about the axis formed by the opening . In some embodiments, the end piece  is not symmetrical across a horizontal plane, but is symmetrical across a vertical plane.The surface of the bell-shaped end piece  can provide a sliding surface on which the lace can slide as it moves in and out of the opening . In some embodiments, the lace enters the opening  from a somewhat sideways direction such that the sliding surface is a portion of the end piece  that is between the least curved portion  and the most curved portion  when the lace is tightened. In some embodiments, the sliding surface can be closer to the least curved lower portion  than to the most curved upper portion  of the end piece . The sliding surface can have a radius of curvature of at least about 2.0 millimeters and/or no of more than about 15.0 millimeters, or of at least about 4.0 millimeters and/or no of more than about 8.0 millimeters, or of about 5.0 millimeters, although curvatures outside of these ranges can be used.is a bottom-up cross-sectional view of the lace guide  taken through a horizontal plane through a midpoint of the main channel . The curvature of the flanges of the end pieces ,  in the plane shown in  can have a radius of curvature of at least about 3.0 millimeters and/or no of more than about 8.0 millimeters, or of about 4.0 millimeters, although curvatures outside these ranges can also be used. In some embodiments, the lace channel  can be generally U-shaped. The first opening  can face in a direction along axis D, where the axis D is a line passing through the center of the first opening  and extending in the direction of a tangent line to the curvature of the main channel  at the first opening, similar to the axis E described above. Thus, the lace  is directed out of the first opening  generally in the direction of the axis D, but the lace path of the lace  leaving the first opening  can vary from the direction of the axis D depending on the position toward which the lace  extends (e.g., toward a next lace guide) and/or depending on the curvature of the lace  through the main channel . The second opening  can face along an axis E, where axis E is similar to the axis D, a line passing through the center of the second opening  and extending in the direction of a tangent line to the curvature of the main channel  at the second opening , as described above. Thus, the lace  can be directed out of the second opening  generally in the direction of the axis E, but the lace path of the lace  leaving the second opening  can vary from the direction of the axis E depending on the position toward which the lace  extends (e.g., toward a next lace guide) and/or depending on the curvature of the lace  through the main channel . In the illustrated embodiment, the first opening  and the second opening  face in substantially the same direction such that the axis D and the axis E are substantially parallel to each other and/or to a central axis C of the lace guide .As can be seen in , for example, in some cases the lace can enter or exit the lace guide at an angle that is offset from the central axis C of the lace guide. Accordingly, in some embodiments, one or both of the openings ,  can face in a direction that is offset from the central axis C of the lace guide  such that the lace  is directed out of one or both of the openings ,  generally along the corresponding axes D, E at an angle with respect to the central axis C. In some embodiments, an angle formed between the axis D of the first opening  and the axis E of the second opening  can be no more than about 45°, or no more than about 30°, or no more than about 15°, or of no more than about 5°. As shown in the illustrated embodiment, in some cases, the openings ,  can face in substantially the same direction. The lace guide  can be symmetrical such that each axes D and E are offset from the central axis C by about the same angle. The lace guide  can also be asymmetrical, such that the axis D of the first opening  is offset from the central axis C by a different angle than the axis E of the second opening . For example, the openings ,  can be angled differently depending on their location on the article, such as near the ankle opening of a shoe. One or both of the axes D and E can be offset from the central axis C by an angle of no more than about 30°, or of no more than about 15°, or of no more than about 5°, or close to or equal to 0°, although angles outside of these ranges can also be used.is a cross-sectional view of the lace guide  similar to that of , but showing a lace  fed through the lace channel. The lace guide  can be formed in various sizes. In the embodiment illustrated in , the lace guide  is a 15 millimeter lace guide in which the center of the first opening  and the center of the second opening  are about 15 millimeters apart.Because at least a portion of the lace channel  is disposed within the upper of the shoe, the depth  of the lace channel  can be greater than on a conventional, external lace guide. A deep external lace guide can appear bulky and cumbersome. Thus, generally, external lace guides have a relatively shallow depth that forces the lace to curve sharper than its natural curvature would allow. This can cause the lace to rub against the inside surface of the lace channel  with more force and/or at more locations than would be the case if a deeper lace guide were used that conformed to the natural curvature of the lace. In some embodiments, when the lace  is tightened past the threshold level of tension, the lace can be pulled against the front wall  of the main channel  such that the lace  contact the substantially the full length of the front wall  through the lace channel . In some embodiments, the lace  can have a tension that is above the threshold level when the lacing system is fully tightened during use, but the tension of the lace  can be below the threshold level during the tightening and loosening process, which is when relative large lengths of the lace  slide through the lace channel . Thus, in some embodiments, as the lace  slides through the lace channel  during the tightening and loosening process, the depth  of the lace channel  can allow the lace  to rub against the inside of the lace channel  with less force and/or at fewer locations than in a conventional, shallow lace guide.The threshold level of tension at which the lace  abuts against the front wall  of the lace channel  can depend on the thickness and materials used for the lace . For example, a more rigid lace can require more tension to bend than a relatively soft lace. The threshold level of curvature can also depend on the size and shape of the pathway through the lace channel . For example, more tension can be required to bend the lace to follow a path having a small radius of curvature. In one example embodiment, for a lace guide having a radius of curvature of 10 mm, and for a lace made of stranded stainless steel of 7×7 construction and having a lace diameter of 1 mm, a tension of about 0.5 to 1.0 pound on each lace end or more would cause the lace to abut against substantially the full length of the inside wall of the lace channel.In some embodiments, the threshold tension can be high enough and/or the desired tension can be low enough so that the lacing system can be tightened to a usable level without causing the lace  to abut against the length of the front wall  of the lace channel . In some embodiments, when the lace  is tight, the lace  can still side in the lace channel , for example, when the user shifts position in a shoe. As the lace  slides through the lace channel , the depth  of the lace channel  can allow the lace  to rub against the inside of the lace channel  with less force and/or at fewer locations than in a conventional, shallow lace guide. This reduced friction can provide a lacing system in which less force is necessary to move the lace through the lace guides, thereby allowing the tension to be more evenly distributed between the lace guides. Fewer contact points and less friction between the lace guides  and the lace  can result in less wear on the components. Also, less friction can allow for the tension in the lacing system to be more evenly distributed during the tightening process and during use of the article. When the article (e.g., shoe) flexes during use, less friction in the lacing system can facilitate movement of the lace  to redistribute the flex according to the contours of the article (e.g., shoe) during use. While in some conventional lacing systems with conventional eyelets, sharp turns and high friction can be desirable to facilitate tightening and tying of the laces at different progressive points along the closure system, in the lacing system , low friction lace guides can be used because the lace can be tightened from a single point or from two or more designated points.In conventional, relatively shallow, lace guides the lace generally contacts the inside of the lace channel at five points or more. In the lace guide , the lace  preferably contacts the lace channel  at no more than four points when under tension. The four contact points -are shown as dots in . Notably, the lace  does not contact the lace channel at or near the apex  thereof, as it would if the depth  of the lace channel  were reduced. In the illustrated embodiment, two of the contact points are at or near the openings , , and two of the contact points are deeper inside the lace channel , and can be, for example, about midway between the openings ,  and the apex . In the embodiment shown in , at the apex , the lace  can be positioned close to the front wall  of the lace channel  that is nearest the openings , . For simplicity the four contact points -are shown positioned along a single plane at the cross section of . However, in some embodiments, the lace  can enter the lace channel  at an angle such that the points of contact -do not lie on a plane level with the lace channel . For example, in some embodiments, the contact points and an be lower in the main channel  (e.g., on or near a bottom surface of the main channel ) than the contact points and (which can be on or near a top surface of the main channel ).is a cross-sectional view of a 20 millimeter lace guide  in which the openings  and  are spaced apart by about 20 millimeters. A lace  passes through the lace channel  and contacts the lace channel  at four contact points -In the embodiment shown in , the lace  can be positioned near the back wall of the lace channel  when at the apex .is a cross-sectional view of a 25 millimeter lace guide  in which the openings  and  are spaced apart by about 25 millimeters. A lace  passes through the lace channel  and contacts the lace channel  at four contact points -In the embodiment shown in , the lace  can be spaced away from both the front and back walls of the lace channel  when at the apex .Many variations are possible. For example, lace guides of other sizes can be made (e.g., 30 millimeter lace guides, or lace guides of sizes between any of those discussed herein). The curvature of the lace channels , ,  can be modified depending on the properties (e.g., materials and thickness) of the lace to be used. For example, a lace with a higher modulus of elasticity is more difficult to bend and stretch. The friction in the lacing system can be increased by using a lace with a higher modulus of elasticity or by turning the lace across tighter corners with a lower radius of curvature. The friction in the lacing system can be decreased by using a lace with a lower modulus of elasticity or by increasing the radius of curvature of the corners. Thus, to maintain a low friction, if a lace is changed to have a higher modulus of elasticity, the radius of curvature in the lace guides can be increased to compensate.In some embodiments, changing the properties of the lace or changing the curvature of the lace channels , ,  can adjust the positions of the four contact points without adding a fifth contact point. As can be seen in , for example, the curvature of the main channel  can be tighter (having a smaller radius of curvature) near the openings ,  than near the apex . In some embodiments, the curvature of the main channel  can be substantially uniform or can be tighter near the apex  than near the openings , . While in illustrated embodiment, the main channel  has a substantially uniform width, in some embodiments the width of the main channel  can vary. For example, the main channel  can be wider near the apex than near the openings , , or vise versa.show steps of an example embodiment of a method for attaching the lace guide  to a shoe . At , the lace guide  can be stitched to a reinforcement material  or tough stay. The stitching  can extend across the stitch flange . In some embodiments, the stitching  can pass over the lace channel  without any of the stitches passing through the lace channel . At , the reinforcement material  can be attached to a liner  or inner material of the shoe  or other article using an adhesive or stitching or any other suitable attachment manner. Stitch flange  may provide additional strength to guide  to allow a softer material in the guide  while preventing the guide  from ripping from the article when placed under operational forced. The stitch flange  can simplify the stitching process by allowing a single linear stitch line  to be used to secure the guide , rather than stitching along the curved path formed by the lace channel .At , an upper layer  is applied over the liner , reinforcement material , and lace guide . The upper layer can be stitched along one edge, and the stitching  can capture the upper layer , the reinforcement material , and the liner . As can be seen in , the upper layer  can include two holes , . The first hole  can align with the first end piece , and the second hole  can align with the second end piece .At , the end pieces ,  are pushed through the corresponding holes , . In some embodiments, the material of the upper layer  can flex to allow the holes ,  to widen when the end pieces are pushed through. In some embodiments, the holes ,  can have a slit that allows the holes ,  to open wide enough for the end pieces ,  to pass through. In some cases, the slits can be stitched closed to prevent the end pieces ,  from passing back through the holes ,  or can be positioned under the external flange. The ridge or step  on the flange can prevent the flange from being pulled back through the corresponding hole.At , the upper layer  can be secured to the lace guide , the reinforcement material , and/or to the liner . In some embodiments, an adhesive  can be applied under the upper layer  and the upper layer  can pressed down onto the lower layers. Stitching (not shown) or any other attachment method can be applied to secure the upper layer  to the lower layers.  shows the shoe  with the upper layer  secured over the lace channel  portion of the lace guide with the end pieces ,  exposed through the holes ,  in the upper layer.Many variations are possible. For example, the reinforcement material  and/or the liner  can be omitted. In some embodiments, the lace guide  can be secured directly to a structure of the shoe . In some embodiments, the lace guide  can be positioned in a recess (not shown) in the shoe  that is configured to receive the lace guide  such that the lace guide is substantially flush with the surrounding surfaces, thereby reducing or eliminating the bulge which can be produced by the cover portion of the lace guide .is a front-top perspective view of a single-end-piece lace guide . Much of the disclosure that relates to the double-end-piece lace guides (e.g., ) also applies to the lace guide . The single-end-piece lace guide  can have a lace channel  with a first opening  and a second opening  at the opposite end thereof. A supplemental lace channel (not shown), e.g., formed by a tubing, can be attached to the second opening  in some embodiments, and in some cases can be inserted into the lace channel . An end piece  can be positioned at or near the opening . The end piece  can be similar to, or the same as, the end piece  described above. A stitch flange  can extend from either side of the lace channel . In some embodiments, a hole  can be positioned on the top surface of the lace channel  at a location that is near the top flange portion  of the end piece . This hole  can allow a tubing which is inserted to be viewable to assure that it is all the way seated into the guide.is a split view of the lace guide  slip along a horizontal plane that intersects the main channel  at its midpoint. In some embodiments, the main channel  does not have an open bottom because an insertion piece can be removed, for example, via the hole  after the molding process. In some embodiments, one or more ridges  can extend from near the opening  toward the other opening , and can end at about the midpoint between the first and second openings , . These ridges  may be present to more easily allow a press fit to be achieved to the inserted tubing to reliably hold the tubing in place. In some embodiments, the main channel  can include four ridges -as can be seen, for example, in the cross-sectional views of .While discussed in terms of certain embodiments, it should be appreciated that the disclosure is not so limited.

                "This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/360,561, filed Jul. 1, 2010, and U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/453,633 filed Mar. 17, 2011, the disclosure of each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, inclusive of their specification, claims, and drawings.The present invention relates generally to the field of orthopedic or prosthetic devices and more particularly to a device for use in the treatment, repair, and rehabilitation of the Achilles tendon following an injury and/or corrective surgery.Achilles tendon rupture is the most common injury involving a tear in a tendon. It commonly occurs as a sports injury during explosive acceleration, for example, while pushing off or jumping up.Treatment of Achilles tendon rupture is typically divided between operative and non-operative management, each of which involve the gradual stretching of the tendon after the rupture has healed.Operative management involves a surgical operation where the ruptured tendon is sutured back together at the point of rupture, and the leg is then placed into a cast. When the leg is placed in the cast, the foot is pointed downward (in an equinus position). As the healing progresses, the equinus position is then gradually decreased (requiring removal of the original cast, and recasting with the newly decreased equinus position).Non-operative management typically involves wearing a cast or walking boot, which allows the ends of torn tendon to reattach themselves on their own. In the non-operative option, the foot is pointed downwards, with the help of heel wedges or insoles, which are placed in the walker boot. The height of the heel wedges or insoles is then incrementally decreased as the process of healing progresses. One disadvantage of using the heel wedges is that reducing the height of the wedges/insole can be too drastic for the injured tendon.Both the operative and the non-operative methods involve a long rehabilitation process, lasting at least 6 months. Additionally, in each situation, removal of the cast or walking boot is necessary in order to adjust the equinus position of the foot, and/or to remove and replace heel wedges or insoles having a different height.Non-operative treatment might seem like a more comfortable way to go aboutAchilles repair, but it does take longer and leaves the patient with a greater risk of re-injury. Immobilization using a plaster cast can take as long as 12 months for the tendon to return to full strength, whereas surgery may only require anywhere for 6 to 9 months. In the past, patients who underwent surgery would wear a cast for approximately 4 to 8 weeks after surgery and were only allowed to gently move the ankle once out of the cast. Recent studies have shown that patients have quicker and more successful recoveries when they are allowed to move and lightly stretch their ankle immediately after surgery. To keep their ankle safe these patients use a removable boot while walking and doing daily activities.In either the operative or the non-operative situation, existing methods for stretching the Achilles tendon can be time consuming and inconvenient to implement. Additionally, existing methods for stretching the Achilles tendon can cause drastic of changes in stretching the length of the Achilles tendon, such that the risk of re-rupture of the tendon is increased.In view of the above discussion, exemplary embodiments of an Achilles tendon stretching device are disclosed that provide improved mechanisms to allow more even stretching of the Achilles tendon, to reduce problems associated with edema, and to promote faster healing of the injured tendon in order to allow for faster recovery and shorter rehabilitation times.Exemplary embodiments of an Achilles tendon stretching device can include manual or automatic mechanisms to allow incremental height changes to an insole placed within a walking boot, orthopedic shoe, or post surgical shoe, in order to allow more even and gradual stretching of the Achilles tendon.Exemplary mechanisms can include manual or automatic screw mechanisms, as well as manual or automatic pneumatic systems. Manual or automatic hydraulic systems are also contemplated.Other exemplary mechanisms can include the use of a heel wedge having layers which can be torn or cut off to adjust the height of the heel wedge.By utilizing the disclosed exemplary embodiments of an Achilles tendon stretching device, the degree of stretching of the tendon can be more easily, and more evenly controlled, in order to avoid drastic changes in the stretched length of the tendon, which may lead to re-rupture of the tendon.It should be noted that the drawing figures are not necessarily drawn to scale, but instead are drawn to provide a better understanding of the components thereof, and are not intended to be limiting in scope, but rather to provide exemplary illustrations. It should further be noted that the figures illustrate exemplary embodiments of an Achilles tendon stretching device and the components thereof, and in no way limit the structures or configurations of an Achilles tendon stretching device and components thereof according to the present disclosure.Exemplary embodiments of an Achilles tendon stretching device are provided for use in the treatment, repair, and rehabilitation of the Achilles tendon following an injury and/or corrective surgery. Features that are provided on one side of the device can easily be provided on the other side of the device. In this manner, it is intended that the exemplary embodiments of the Achilles tendon stretching device described herein may be used on either right or left lower legs, with any appropriate reconfiguration of components that is deemed necessary for the proper fit and function of the device for the purpose of treatment, repair, and rehabilitation of the Achilles tendon of either the left or right lower leg.In the exemplary embodiments of the Achilles tendon stretching device described herein, quick release strap mechanisms may be used to provide ease of securing and tightening the device to the lower leg. Exemplary quick release strap mechanisms are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,198,610, granted April 2007, commonly owned, and herein incorporated in the entirety by reference.The exemplary embodiments of the disclosure are adapted for treatment, repair, and rehabilitation of the Achilles tendon of human beings, and may be dimensioned to accommodate different types, shapes and sizes of human joints and appendages.The exemplary embodiments of an Achilles tendon stretching device can be implemented in various configurations of walking boots, orthopedic shoes, or post surgical shoes.For example, exemplary embodiments of an Achilles tendon stretching device can be implemented within a circumferential type walker , as shown in . An exemplary circumferential type walker  includes a posterior shell  and an anterior, dorsal shell or plate , such that the lower leg is generally fully enclosed and supported by the walker .

No. 5,078,128, granted January 1992, U.S. Pat. No. 5,329,705, granted July 1994, U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,385, granted November 1995, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,303,538, granted December 2007, all commonly owned and incorporated herein in the entirety by reference. Additional exemplary materials and configurations for components of the Achilles tendon stretching device can be found in U.S. publication no. 2009/0287127, published Nov. 19, 2009, commonly owned, and herein incorporated in the entirety by reference.For further ease of understanding the exemplary embodiments of an orthopedic device as disclosed herein, a description of a few terms is necessary. As used herein, the term “dorsal” has its ordinary meaning and refers to the top surfaces of the foot, ankle and foreleg or shin. As used herein, the term “plantar” has its ordinary meaning and refers to a bottom surface, such as the bottom of a foot. As used herein, the term “proximal” has its ordinary meaning and refers to a location that is closer to the heart than another location. Likewise, the term “distal” has its ordinary meaning and refers to a location that is further from the heart than another location. The term “posterior” also has its ordinary meaning and refers to a location that is behind or to the rear of another location. Lastly, the term “anterior” has its ordinary meaning and refers to a location that is ahead of or to the front of another location.The terms “rigid,” “flexible,” and “resilient” may be used herein to distinguish characteristics of portions of certain features of the orthopedic device. The term “rigid” is intended to denote that an element of the device is generally devoid of flexibility. Within the context of support members or shells that are “rigid,” it is intended to indicate that they do not lose their overall shape when force is applied, and in fact they may break if bent with sufficient force. On the other hand, the term “flexible” is intended to denote that features are capable of repeated bending such that the features may be bent into retained shapes or the features do not retain a general shape, but continuously deform when force is applied. The term “resilient” is used to qualify such flexible features as generally returning to an initial general shape without permanent deformation. As for the term “semi-rigid,” this term is used to connote properties of support members or shells that provide support and are free-standing, however such support members or shells may have some degree of flexibility or resiliency.A first exemplary embodiment of an Achilles tendon stretching device is shown in  as implemented in a generally circumferential walker  of the type shown in .As shown, the walker  includes a posterior shell  and an outsole . An adjustment dial  is provided to allow adjustment of the height of an insole  in order to adjust the amount of stretching of the Achilles tendon.In order to aid with determining the amount of stretching of the Achilles tendon, a marker  is provided on the adjustment dial  which points at distinct indicia , for example numerical indicators, provided on the posterior shell  and/or the outsole . It will be recognized that the indicia may be provided on the adjustment dial  itself, and the marker may be provided on the posterior shell  or the outsole .In order to provide a more even and less drastic stretching, each numerical indication of indicia  can represent a height change (increase or decrease) of 1 mm of the insole , such that each incremental movement of the adjustment dial  from one indicia to the next represents a change in height of the insole  of 1 mm. Of course, the height change represented by the incremental rotation of the adjustment dial  may be more or less than 1 mm.As shown in , the adjustment dial  includes an adjustment screw  that can be connected to a scissor jack mechanism  positioned between the insole  and a plantar sole portion .The adjustment dial  can be manually rotated, and may include appropriate textures or shapes to aid with manual manipulation such as gripping thereof by the person adjusting the mechanism.In the exemplary configuration, with manual adjustment of the adjustment dial , a practitioner or other authorized person can rotate the adjustment dial  one increment, once a week, in order to decrease the height of the insole  by 1 mm once every week in order to increase the amount of stretch of the Achilles tendon by 1 mm each week during use of the device. In this manner, a more even stretch of the Achilles tendon can be achieved, in order to avoid drastic changes in the stretched length of the tendon, which may lead to re-rupture of the tendon. With the exemplary configuration of the Achilles tendon stretching device, the walker  does not need to be removed from the patient in order to achieve adjustment thereofIn a variation, an electric motor  (shown in outline in ) may be provided, along with an appropriate control mechanism, in order allow for automatic adjustment of the adjustment dial . Such an adjustment may be made once a week, as discussed above, or may be accomplished in even smaller increments throughout a week in order to provide an even more gradual change in the amount of stretching of the Achilles tendon.Appropriate onboard electronics (including, for example, sensors such as accelerometers, strain gauges, angle sensors, gyroscopes, etc.) and communication mechanisms (such as wireless Internet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, infrared, etc.) can be provided  (exemplarily shown in outline in ) in order to sense the amount of activity of the user (and healing of the Achilles tendon), to automatically adjust the height of the insole  appropriately, and to provide communicative messages to a practitioner who may then remotely monitor the progress of the healing of the Achilles tendon.In another variation of the Achilles tendon stretching device, instead of the adjustment dial , a socket head cap screw (or other suitable machine screw) can be provided as the adjustment screw .In a second exemplary embodiment of an Achilles tendon stretching device shown in , a generally circumferential walker  has a posterior shell , a planter sole , and an outsole .In contrast to the embodiment shown in , the adjustment mechanism is provided through the plantar sole  and the distal surface of the outsole . Additionally, instead of an adjustment dial, a socket head cap screw (or other suitable machine screw) is provided as the adjustment screw . The practitioner can utilize an Allen wrench in order to adjust the height of the insole  in order to adjust the amount of stretching of the Achilles tendon.The far end of the adjustment screw  can be connected to the insole  by way of a universal joint , which allows rotation of the end of the adjustment screw , while providing a vertical translation of the insole .Instead of the socket head cap screw, a dial with indicia, similarly to adjustment dial , may be used.Rotation of the adjustment screw  to decrease the height of the insole  will cause the socket head portion of the adjustment screw  to become spaced from the plantar sole . The depth of the opening in the outsole  should be sufficient to accommodate the movement of the socket head portion of the adjustment screw .Alternatively, an appropriate mechanical mechanism can be provided to cause the rotation of the adjustment screw  to be translated into the vertical height adjustment of the insole , without any corresponding vertical movement of the adjustment screw , such as for example, a scissor jack mechanism.Similarly as discussed above, an electric motor and associated control mechanisms can be provided in order to allow automatic (gradual and/or incremental) adjustment of the adjustment screw .In a variation shown in , the adjustment screw  may be replaced by a pneumatic or hydraulic piston and cylinder , which may be controlled in a known manner to achieve vertical height adjustment of the insole  with respect to the plantar sole .Like the previously discussed embodiment, a practitioner can adjust this Achilles tendon stretching device once a week, in order to decrease the height of the insole  by 1 mm once every week in order to increase the amount of stretch of the Achilles tendon by 1 mm each week during use of the device. In this manner, a more even stretch of the Achilles tendon can be achieved, in order to avoid drastic changes in the stretched length of the tendon, which may lead to re-rupture of the tendon. Similarly, with this exemplary configuration of the Achilles tendon stretching device, the walker  does not need to be removed from the patient in order to achieve adjustment thereof.A third exemplary embodiment of an Achilles tendon stretching device is shown in . In this embodiment, a walker  includes a posterior shell , a plantar sole , an outsole , and an adjustable height insole .A pneumatic bladder  constructed of suitable materials capable of retaining a gas such as air therein, is provided between the plantar sole  and the insole . A valve mechanism  is provided at the posterior of the bladder  and protruding through an opening in the posterior shell  for access thereto by a practitioner. Any suitable valve mechanism, such as, for example a Schrader valve or a Presta valve, can be provided. It will be recognized that the valve mechanism  can alternatively be positioned to protrude through the plantar sole  and outsole .Once a week, the patient can visit the practitioner, and the practitioner can release an appropriate amount of gas from the bladder , using the valve , in order to decrease the height of the insole  by an appropriate amount, for example, 1 mm.Like the previously discussed embodiments, the walker  need not be removed from the patient in order to effectuate adjustment of the height of the insole . Similarly, a more even stretch of the Achilles tendon can be achieved, in order to avoid drastic changes in the stretched length of the tendon, which may lead to re-rupture of the tendon.As a variation, a slow leak valve can be provided to automatically and continuously release a predefined amount of gas from the bladder  in order to automatically and gradually reduce the height of the insole , for example, an amount of 1 mm per week. Such a slow leak valve can be, for example, a slit valve designed to allow the slit to partially open in response to a continuous predefined pressure applied by the weight of the wearer of the walker . Alternatively, the slow leak valve can be any mechanical valve that can be set to an open or closed configuration, and which can be set in a slightly opened position to allow the slow leak. For example, any suitable ball valve, disc valve, butterfly valve, etc., may be utilized as a slow leak valve.As a further variation, appropriate processor and automatic valve (for example an electrically operated solenoid valve) mechanisms can be provided to effectuate gradual and/or incremental release of gas from the bladder .In yet another variation, as shown in , a walker  includes a posterior shell , a plantar sole , an outsole , an adjustable height insole , and a bladder  having a valve . This variation of the Achilles tendon stretching device functions in generally the same manner as the device shown in , with the exception that in addition to the bladder  positioned between the plantar sole  and the insole , removable and interchangeable heel wedges  having different heights are provided (one at a time) between the bladder  and the insole  and the plantar sole . Alternatively, multiple heel wedges of consistent heights can be provided in place of the interchangeable heel wedges .With this configuration and an automatically controlled release of gas from the bladder , the height of the insole  would gradually decrease throughout a week, and when the patient visits the practitioner, the heel wedge  can be replaced with a heel wedge of lower height (or one of the multiple heel wedges can be removed) and the bladder  can be reinflated.While pneumatic bladders and valves are disclosed, it is contemplated that hydraulic bladders and valves may also be used.Again, these configurations provide for a more even stretch of the Achilles tendon can be achieved, in order to avoid drastic changes in the stretched length of the tendon, which may lead to re-rupture of the tendon.A fourth exemplary embodiment of an Achilles tendon stretching device in the form of a heel wedge  having layers , , ,  which can be torn or cut off to adjust the height of the heel wedge is shown in .The heel wedge  can be used in any orthopedic device for use with the foot, for example, walkers, diabetic walkers, post-op shoes, ankle braces, or any type of footwear, such as shoes or boots.The heel wedge  can be made from any suitable material, for example ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) foam. Further, the heel wedge  can be made from compression molded EVA foam. Exemplary EVA foam can have a density/hardness in the range of 35-60 shore. Another suitable material may be an artificial cork, such as an EVA cork mixture that is thermo moldable at approximately 120 to 140 degrees and results in a density/hardness of  shore. Another exemplary material may be polyurethane.As shown in , the heel wedge  has a number of layers, all of which are integrally formed and connected together at an anterior portion of the heel wedge . As shown the heel wedge  includes first layer , second layer , third layer , and fourth layer . However, the number of layers shown is merely exemplary, and any suitable greater or lesser number of layers, for example ten to fifteen layers, may be used in order to achieve the desired amount and increments of height adjustment.In use, the heel wedge  can be positioned within the heel portion of orthopedic device with all of the integrally formed layers thereof retained. Thus, the Achilles tendon of a user of the heel wedge  will be shortened to a first length.In order to incrementally stretch the Achilles tendon of the user of the heel wedge , the layers , , ,  thereof can be incrementally cut or torn from the heel wedge  in order to reduce the height of the heel wedge , thus stretching the Achilles tendon of the user to incrementally greater lengths.The thickness or height of the layers , , ,  corresponds to the desired incremental stretch length of the Achilles tendon, and may be any desired thickness or height.In use, to adjust the stretch length of the Achilles tendon at a first time, the heel wedge  can be removed from the heel portion of orthopedic device. Then, the first layer  can be torn or cut away from the heel wedge , which can then be replaced in the heel portion of orthopedic device.Treatment can then occur for the desired length of time to stretch the Achilles tendon at the length that is provided by removing the first layer  of the heel wedge . This process can be repeated as necessary by removing subsequent layers , ,  in succession to treat Achilles tendon injuries and surgical recovery with incremental stretching of the Achilles tendon.It is noted that if greater height adjustment is needed during a specified treatment period, more than one of the adjacent layers , , ,  can be removed simultaneously. For example, after an initial treatment period using the heel wedge  having layers , , , , the adjacent first and second layers ,  can be torn off of cut away in order to provide a greater height adjustment to increase the amount that the Achilles tendon is stretched.This process can allow the use of a heel wedge  having numerous layers of minimal thickness, for example 1 mm, for numerous treatment therapies for Achilles tendon injuries. Such a heel wedge and process can then be modified for each particular treatment protocol, where, for example one protocol requires an incremental height adjustment of 1 mm per week, and another treatment protocol requires an incremental height adjustment of 5 mm per week.For the treatment protocol requiring an incremental height adjustment of 1 mm per week, only a single layer of the heel wedge  would be removed each week. Similarly, for the treatment protocol requiring an incremental height adjustment of 5 mm per week, five of the layers of the heel wedge  would be removed each week.Thus, in this manner, only one type of heel wedge  need be manufactured in order to satisfy numerous treatment protocols.In order to provide additional stability to the Achilles tendon, and to prevent slipping of the user's heel within the orthopedic device and, therefore inadvertent stretching of the Achilles tendon, a heel stop  can be provided on the proximal surface  of the heel wedge .The heel stop  can be formed, for example, from a compression molded EVA foam, or can be an injected molded thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), or any other suitable material.As seen in , the heel stop  can have a generally triangular shape, with a raised ridge provided on a proximal surface thereof, such that the raised ridge provides a stop against forward migration of the user's heel during use. In an alternative configuration, the heel stop  can have a generally trapezium or trapezoidal shape, such that a planar surface is provided at the raised ridge. The planar surface can thus provide an additional frictional surface to engage at least a portion of the arch of the user's foot in order to prevent slippage of the user's heel.The heel stop  can be glued or secured with adhesive directly to the proximal surface  of the heel wedge . Alternatively, the heel stop  may be held in place on the proximal surface  of the heel wedge  by the weight of the user and frictional forces.Thus, it can be seen that the heel wedge  having a number of layers, all of which are integrally formed and connected together at an anterior portion of the heel wedge , and which can be selectively removed as desired to achieve incremental height adjustment and stretching of the Achilles tendon provides a convenient and simple way to effect treatment and recovery for Achilles tendon injuries and surgeries.It will be recognized that the exemplary embodiments of an Achilles tendon stretching device and components thereof can be made from any suitable materials.While one week has been described above as a suitable time period for measuring when adjustment to the Achilles tendon stretching device should be made, it will be recognized that any suitable or desired time period may be utilized.It will also be recognized that the various locations of each of the adjustment mechanisms of the exemplary Achilles tendon stretching devices described herein can be variously located in any convenient location, for example, at the posterior of the walker or in the plantar sole region of the walker.While specific mechanical mechanisms (for example, a scissor jack or a socket head cap screw and universal joint) are described herein for adjusting the height of an insole with respect to the planter sole of a walker, any suitable mechanical, pneumatic, and/or hydraulic mechanism can be used to adjust the height of the insole. For example, pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders and pistons may be positioned between the insoles and plantar soles and used to raise and lower the adjustable height insoles. For example, a pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder and piston can be oriented to provide vertical translation to raise or lower the insole with respect to the plantar sole. Such pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders and pistons can be configured to automatically adjust height, either incrementally or continuously, as discussed in detail above with respect to alternatively recited configurations. The specific design and implementation of such pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders and pistons will be recognized by a person having skill the art.Of course, it is to be understood that not necessarily all objects or advantages may be achieved in accordance with any particular embodiment of the invention. Thus, for example, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention may be embodied or carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or group of advantages as taught herein without necessarily achieving other objects or advantages as may be taught or suggested herein.The skilled artisan will recognize the interchangeability of various disclosed features from the disclosed embodiments and variations. In addition to variations described herein, other known equivalents for each feature can be mixed and matched by one of ordinary skill in this art to construct an Achilles tendon stretching device in accordance with principles of the present invention.Although this invention has been disclosed in the context of exemplary embodiments and examples, it therefore will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention extends beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments to other alternative embodiments and/or uses of the invention and obvious modifications and equivalents thereof. Thus, it is intended that the scope of the present invention herein disclosed should not be limited by the particular disclosed embodiments described above."

                "The present invention relates generally to footwear and more particularly to a shoe that has been adapted to improve a walker's power posture and comfort. This is accomplished by a unique shape & structure of footwear arrangement, which optimizes the use of all muscles of lower limbs and increases the power of the walker, present inventive shoe adopts to the shape of the foot and supports the foot in all stages of normal walking, provides shoe spring or rebound cushioning. Although the shoe provides benefits which extend to all forms of footwear including sports shoes, it has proven especially effective for use by people who walk for exercise and or competition, and is described in the context of race walking below.Locomotion or walking is an important and basic function of humans. Our life depends on walking, Walking is essential in providing the basic necessities of life, ‘Movement is life and life is movement’ and movement is necessary to all living beings, walking has evolved over millions of years. Human walking is an advanced form of walking of all living creatures. Each and every muscle, bones are interlinked, developed and evolved to the needs of varied movements of the body, perfected and evolved to the present state, thus human walking is a highly evolved essential organ system, all other organs of our body like heart, liver, kidney, digestive organs are built around the walking organ, “life means walking, walking means life”, due to the faulty and unscientific foot wear presently used, normal walking is suppressed, this causes disuse of muscles and humans are suffering from life style diseases, hence foot wear is not just a protective device of the foot but also a health device, foot is the gate way of individual's health.Foot wear has been designed as protective device to the foot, many inventions have been taken place in the field of foot wear yet so far no foot wear has been designed to suit the normal walking style of humans. Human's foot is flat, yet normal walking is not flat it takes many shapes with each step but our present foot wear is flat, sole of the present foot wear is hard and inflexible, foot in natural walking is flexible and changes its shape, hence present foot wear do not promote normal walking due to this rigidity and this defect in the present foot wear leads to life style diseases like obesity, cardiac diseases, osteoporosis arthritis of knee, spondylosis, backache, ankle fractures, hip fractures and other diseases, It is evident that lack of proper walking techniques and exercise are the main reason for the advent of these life style diseases.Normal walking has heel strike, foot flat, heel off and toe off stages. Modern foot wear with its hard rigid soles do not allow so many movements of the foot, this causes disuse atrophy of various muscles of the leg, back and other parts of the body, in effect our body gradually adjusts to the foot wear, instead of foot wear adjusting to our foot, we are left with one movement of the foot that is foot flat stage, This makes a chain of reactions in the body, the muscles gets disuse, bulk of the muscles decreases, body falls to this trap and succumbs to modern life style diseases as a consequence to the use of badly designed rigid soled foot wear.In recent years to overcome the modern life style diseases there has been an explosion in the physical fitness industry, and correspondingly, in the desire for better equipment which improves an individual's performance of activities which promote good health, perfect walking is an area which requires a particular importance which improve physical condition without unduly taxing an individual's joints, walking have thus popularized and have developed into competition sports such as performance walking or race walking, the sport serves as an increasingly popular form of exercise and recreation, attracting persons of differing levels of skill and physical ability, the fitness industry, however, has been slow in recognizing this trend, and has yet to develop an acceptable walking shoe, walkers have thus been forced to use the running shoes, shoes designed to accommodate a high impact activity which requires very different foot posture, stride technique, impact absorption, and overall shoe use from that of performance walking or race walking.Walking technique consists of series of steps, where each step constitutes a cycle in which the walker shifts from a single support phase to a double support phase and then back to the single support phase. In the single support phase the walker's entire weight is balanced on one foot, the other foot being moved forward so as to move the walker into the double support phase. In the double support phase, the walker's weight is balanced between a leading and a trailing foot, the trailing foot is used to push the walker forward so as to again enter the single support phase, and begin the cycle anew, the aforementioned “push-off” begins during the single support phase when the walker's center of gravity passes over the supporting foot. The walker, at all times, has at least one foot in contact with the ground, reducing the impact associated with each step, and resulting in an overall lower impact exercise routine.With each step in the stride phase, the human's foot lands on the heel or heel strike phase, and moves forward to a planted position or foot flat position with the heel and a ball of the foot supported from below. The ball of the foot acts as a fulcrum, the walker's foot pivoting forward about the fulcrum as the walker's center of gravity passes there over, the foot then moves forward to heel off and toe off stages, This stage accommodates push-off by the walker's toes, the walker's push-off with the trailing foot to assist the leading foot to plant so as to provide the walker with longer stride and stable support.In conventional shoes the sole of the shoes is flat, in some shoe the wearer's heel is elevated relative to the toes and the ball of the foot preventing the movement of the foot and in all the shoes the sole will be rigid, hard and inflexible and flat when the foot is planted, this arrangement of the shoes does not allow double support and causes the disuse of leg, thigh & hips muscles and decreases in size this leads to improper walking posture, which can lead to injury, bad posture detracts and decreases the wearer's walking power and walking speed, the wearer will tend to stand with a body reclined slightly so as to maintain balance, stand on the front of the foot rather than back of the foot results in an unhealthy posture and increases the likelihood of injury to the walker's lower torso, conventional shoes also detract from walking efficiency because it is necessarily provided a sole with an undersurface which is generally planar, rigid and inflexible from the shoe's heel to the tip of its toe, however, during fast walking, planar shoes may be uncomfortable and does not confirm to the shape of the foot along the various stages of walking, most of the times this deters the foot movement, reduces the use of calf muscle and hamstring muscle and in turn reduces the bulk of the calf muscles, hamstrings muscles and gluteus muscles.The problems explained are overcome by the present inventive design. The device according to the invention for perfect Gait shoe  hereinafter called Perfect Gait Shoe , comprises an upper shoe  and a sole , the upper shoe  is used for the reliable fixing of the walking device  to the foot, this can take place by means of straps, such as are used for sandals, laces as are used in the case of beach shoes or an entire upper shoe made from leather or a textile material, what is important is that through said upper shoes  the foot is firmly and comfortably connected to the midsole . The sole  is divided into front section, mid section and rear section, shape of the shoe in unique to the present invention, the front section intersects with mid section at an angulation of 45 to 95 degrees and, the mid section intersects with rear section at an angulation of 85-125 degree.The sole  has undersole  which has pockets which contains highly compressible materials in the front and rear section, the midsole  of the front and the rear sections contains cushion materials, the undersole  contains a wedge shaped sole which is made of hard materials in the rear section under sole  has hard strip  across all sections of the footwear, maintains the shape of the footwear.A Perfect Gait Shoe According to one aspect of the invention, includes the shape of the foot wear, the foot wear is divided into front section, mid section and rear section, the front section of the sole interfaces with the mid section at an angle of 45 to 95 degree, mid section interfaces with the rear section at an angle of 85 to 125 degree. The perfect gait shoe also includes a hard under sole with oval to varied shaped pockets filled with highly compressible material in the front section and the rear section of the foot wear, this provides cushioning of the fore foot and hind foot. The rear section of the foot wear also has a very hard sole in the rear end of the under sole, the newly invented perfect gait shoes of the foot wear helps in shoe confirming to the shape of the foot in heel strike, foot flat, heel off and toe off stages of walking, the inventing design of the sole helps in providing adequate cushion to the foot preventing pain and injury to the bones of the fore foot and hind foot, the hard outer sole helps in transmitting the muscular force to the ground during walking, the invented shoe thus helps in building up of the muscles of hip, thigh, leg and foot by promoting natural walking, this bulk of muscles prevents the onset of modern life style diseases.Present invention is to improve the shoe or the other foot wears of the aforementioned type in such a way that active walking, active standing, active sitting becomes easy and necessary; it is useful in building up of the muscles. As a result daily walking becomes natural promoting the buildup of muscles, strengthening of ligaments, protecting the joints, straighten the posture, all parts of the body gets revitalized and is able to walk faster and longer, this increases the stride and cadence of individuals, helps in competing in various athletic competition, also increases the lung capacity and heart pumping capacity, bulkier leg muscles provides stamina to the body, increases the individual's capacity to work, more work means more burning of calories and less fat accumulation and more productivity, thus the present invented shoes not only prevents the modern life style diseases but also increases productivity.Our new perfect gait walking device is not just a foot wear, it is a new health device which reinvents the perfect walking style, rejuvenates the muscles of the leg and body which in turn rejuvenates all other organs like lungs, heart, and kidney and prevents life style diseases, promotes good health to the mankind.The newly invented walking shoe's use is intended for use in pairs, one shoe being placed on each of the wearer's feet, as previously described, walking consists of a series of steps, each step constituting a cycle wherein a walker shifts from a single support phase to a double support phase, and then back to the single support phase, in action during the single support phase, the walker's entire weight is balanced on one foot, the other foot being moved forward so as to move the walker into the double support phase, in the double support phase, the walker's weight is balanced between a leading foot and a trailing foot. The trailing foot is used to push the walker forward so as to again enter the single support phase, and being the cycle anew, Push-off begins during the single support phase when the walker's center of gravity passes over the supporting foot.With each step, an individual's foot lands on the heel and transitions forward from the heel strike position to a planted position with the heel and ball of the foot supported from below by the ground to heel off stage where the fore foot takes 3 times the weight of the body, the unique shape of the foot wear and differing densities of the sole serve to provide a smooth transition as the walker's weight shifts from the heel to the forefoot, providing smooth movement of the foot from heel to toes body moves forward. This accordingly helps in full functioning of the muscles of foot, leg, thigh, hip, back and makes each of these muscles strong at least some of the sole compresses the energy and is stored, the unique shape of the sole helps in the maximizing the push of the foot by utilizing the full muscles power of the limb, perfect gait shoe perfectly adopts to shape of the foot and allows maximum shift of centre of gravity of the body without any hindrance, the central support along all sections of the shoe helps to maintain the shape of the foot wear even during the deforming weight that falls on the foot wear during walking.The outer sole has hard strip across front, mid and rear sections of the footwear confirming to the shape of perfect gait shoe, made of different hard materials, this supports and maintains the shape of the foot wear prevents any derangement of the shape of the foot wear by the force of the body that fall on the foot wear during the movement of the leg.The shoe according to the present invention, when a walker's foot is planted, as in the single support phase orientation, the walker's weight rests on the heel portion of the shoe on the ground surface, the principal components of the body weight being transmitted from heel to shoe and to the ground, the hardness of the heel sole in these areas is important in determining the posture of the wearer's foot, the heel sole thickness and hardness defines the forward movement of the foot, the density of the sole also influences the stride, the special design at the rear section helps to transmit all the forces of the muscles to the ground, soft under sole of the present invention not only provides the cushioning to the heel bones and also prevents pain, injury to the heel bones, shoe promotes the development of the muscles of the leg, thigh and hips, the perfect gait walking shoe also confirms to the unique shape of the foot in all stages of walking.The walker's foot is dorsiflexed, when the heel strikes the ground relative to the plane of the ground, center of gravity is in the heel, the inventive angling of the forefoot section of the shoe upper will allow maximum dorsiflexion of the foot, as the walker's center of gravity shifts forward to the planted foot, posture of the shoe also shifts to a planar position, the inventive design of the mid section of the sole with hard elastic material not only helps to protects the arch of the foot but also limits the strain to the arch of the foot, the perfect gait walking shoe also gives the shape of flatness to the foot in this stage and confirms to the shape of the foot, the inventive design of the shoe allow smooth transition of centre of gravity from heel to toes and allows smooth forward movement of the foot and the body, the inventive central support in all sections of the foot wear helps to maintain the shape of the foot wear during walking overcoming the with holding deforming body forces.In the walker's toe off stage the weight of the whole body and the centre of gravity shift to the forefoot, flatness of the front section of the sole and lifting of the mid and rear sections of the foot wear in the perfect gait walking shoe assists the movement of the foot, limb and the body, the special design at the midsole and under sole of the present invention not only provides the cushioning to the forefoot bones and also prevents pain, injury to the forefoot bones, because of the unique shape of the shoe with the lift in the rear section facilitates the faster walk without injury and pain, this design maximizes the utilization of all muscles of the foot, calf, hamstrings, hip and spinal muscles, the maximum utilization of all the muscles not only strengthens the muscles but also prevents life style diseases, the perfect gait walking shoe also confirms to the shape of the foot in this stage.In modern society sitting and table work forms great part of the life, this results in compulsory inactivity, leads to massive disuse of skeletal muscles, everyone loves the luxury life and humans love comforts, inventors have designed all sorts of comforts of promoting passive life styles, this passive life style leads to more disuse of muscles and leads to modern life styles diseases.To prevent these catastrophic events and leading to the trap of life style diseases active sitting should be encouraged, our newly invented shoe helps in this active sitting, the unique shape of the newly invented shoe helps in active sitting, the flat front section of the shoe helps in putting the fore foot firmly to the ground and lifting the heel off the ground while sitting, this posture helps in the effective use of calf muscles and hamstring muscles of both the legs, even during sitting as a result the bulk of these muscles increases, this increased bulk of the muscles rejuvenates the other muscles of the body in doing more work utilizing the extra glucose in the blood preventing the storage of this extra glucose and prevent life style diseases.Active sitting can be achieved and facilitated by the inventive design of Perfect Gait Shoe, two types of active sitting and exercise can be done one by putting the weight on the fore foot, this increases the hamstrings and other muscles, second by putting the weight on the heel this strengthens the muscles of the legs, the present inventive shoe promotes doing exercise even during sittings.The drawings show preferred embodiments illustrated by the following description.  illustrates the present invention.A device according to the invention for perfect

                "This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application number 12/856,709 filed on 16 Aug. 2010 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/526,987 filed on 26 Sep. 2006 which is related to and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/720,750 filed on 26 Sep. 2005 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/830,922 filed on 15 Jul. 2006, the contents of all of said applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.The invention concerns footwear and, more particularly, footwear having provisions for allowing independent movement of a wearer's toes while providing comfort, protection, and enhanced haptic response.As is widely accepted, toe movement is essential to the efficient overall movement of the body. See, e.g.: www.posetech.com; “Kick Off Your Shoes and Run Awhile”, Christopher McDougall, NY Times, 23 Jun. 2005; etc. Toe action and the overall haptic response of the foot upon the ground play an important role in walking, jogging, running, etc., and in providing and maintaining a person's bodily balance. Herein, “haptic response” is used to mean a tactile sense of response relating particularly to the sense of touch associated with the feet and lower legs with respect to the ground/surface.Conventional shoes generally include a sole portion and an upper formed above the sole and attached to a periphery thereof. The sole is shaped to underlie the bottom of a wearer's foot from the heel area through the arch, ball of the foot, up to and even beyond the tips of the toes. The upper extends over the sole to delimit a cavity which receives the foot. A portion of the upper extends over the toe area of the sole to form a toe cap at the front portion of the shoe. When the shoe is worn, the toes extend into the toe cap and lie therein adjacent one another. In this way, the foot rests upon a thick sole the bottom of which is generally flat for providing even contact with the ground. That is, when the shoe is at rest, the sole is disposed flush against the ground.When the conventional shoe is worn, the entire front toe cap portion acts as a single unit. The movement of the toe cap portion is generally limited to a pivoting action about the ball of the foot. That is, despite the various movements of the five toes disposed therein, the toe cap portion moves as a single unit in only one direction at a time.In this way, the conventional shoe can limit the natural movements of the toes and thus effect the overall operation and performance of the foot. Additionally, the toe cap portion limits, if not restricts, the wearer's ability to spread his/her toes within the toe cap portion. This can lead to significant discomfort of the wearer. This discomfort is compounded when the toes are crowded into the toe cap portion.Moreover, the thick sole of a conventional shoe isolates the natural contouring and curvature of the foot from the ground, thus minimizing the foot's haptic sensations with respect to the ground. This can cause a general disassociation between a person and the ground resulting the development of improper foot and/or toe action while walking, running, etc. and can be generally disadvantageous with respect to the person's balance, agility, and overall foot health.Attempts have been made to provide footwear having individual portions which encapsulate each toe separately. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,967,390, 4,651,354, and 5,774,898. However, none of these have been successful in enabling free and independent toe articulation while at the same time providing enhanced comfort and increased haptic response along with a significant degree of foot and toe protection.Further attempts have been made to contour the sole of a shoe to correspond to curvatures of the foot. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,989,349, 5,317,819, 5,544,429, 6,115,941, and 6,708,424. However, all of these teachings require an outsole and a mid-sole, the combined thickness of which separates the foot of the wearer from the ground, thus reducing haptic response. Additionally, these attempts are generally directed toward a shoe sole which has a generally planar bottom surface for flushly engaging the ground. As mentioned above, this configuration further degrades the haptic response provided by the shoe. Moreover, these references disclose a shoe having a conventional toe cap portion for containing all five toes in a restrictive single compartment. Therefore, independent articulation of toes is not permitted, therefore further degrading the wearer's haptic response and resulting in increased foot discomfort.Thus, there is a need for footwear which is shaped to the natural contour of the feet and which allows independent intrinsic movement of the feet, and particularly the toes, in order to enhance performance of the foot, increase haptic response, and to bring increased comfort to the wearer and yet which still provides coverage and protection to the toes and to the remainder of the foot.The above discussed and other problems and deficiencies of the prior art are overcome or alleviated by the invention which provides a novel and nonobvious footwear.Footwear including a sole, an upper, and a securement arrangement configured to secure the footwear to the foot of a wearer, where the sole and the upper delimit individual toe portions configured to receive, retain, and allow independent articulation of corresponding individual toes of a foot inserted in the footwear, and where the sole includes contouring and curvature which intimately corresponds to the shape of the foot.The above-discussed and other features and advantages of the apparatus and method will be appreciated and understood by those skilled in the art from the following drawings and detailed description.shows a perspective view of a footwear  in one embodiment of the invention. The footwear  is generally composed of a sole  and an upper  attached to the sole  around a periphery of the sole . The footwear  further comprises an insole  disposed atop and attached to the sole . The insole  is also attached to the upper  at a periphery of the insole .As best shown in , the footwear  includes several regions which generally correspond to various parts of the foot. A rear foot portion  is disposed toward a rear of the footwear  and is generally configured for fitting around and supporting the heel of a wearer. A mid-foot portion  extends forward from the rear portion  and corresponds generally with the arch area of the foot. A fore-foot portion  extends forward of the mid-foot portion  and generally corresponds to the area of the ball of the foot, that is, the area proximate to the joining of the metatarsals and proximal phalanges. A front portion  is the forward most region of the footwear  and generally aligns with, supports, and protects the toes of the foot.The front portion  of the footwear  includes individual toe portions  formed by a unique and intricate shaping of the sole , upper , and insole . The sole  includes splits  in the front portion  which delimit respective toe portions . See, particularly, . The upper  includes toe regions  which extend from a top  of the upper  downward to the periphery of the sole . That is, the toe regions  extend downwardly between the individual toe portions  and are affixed therein to the sole  along edges of the splits . The insole  includes respective toe portions (not shown) which are fixed to the toe portions  of the sole  and which extend into the toe portions .The toe portions  are effectively individual cavities delimited by the intricate and unique shaping of the sole , upper , and insole . In use, the toes of the wearer each individually extend into the cavities of the toe portions .The sole  generally includes various contouring to enhance the comfort and the protection provided by the footwear . For example, the sole  includes sole toe extensions  at the individual toe portions . The sole toe extensions  extend upwardly from the bottom of the footwear  at each of the toe portions  to meet the top  of the upper . As seen in , these sole toe extensions  actually extend atop the footwear  so as to be disposed above at least a portion of the toe nails of the toes of the wearer. Moreover, the sole toe extensions  extend laterally around sides of the toe portions . In this way, the toe extensions  of the sole  form individual toe caps on each of the toe portions  which protect the toes disposed therein at least partially from front, side, and top impacts.The sole  further includes a lateral portion  and a medial portion  which extend upwardly on respective sides of the footwear . The lateral portion  of the sole  is disposed on an outer portion of the footwear  and extends from the outermost toe extension  of the sole  to a heel portion  of the sole . The medial portion  of the sole  is disposed on an inner portion of the footwear  and extends from the innermost toe extension  to the heel portion . The lateral portion  and medial portion  protect sides of the foot from side impact and exposure.The heel portion  of the sole  includes a heel cup  which is configured for receiving and retaining the heel of the wearer. The heel portion  further includes an upper portion  extending upward from the heel cup  and opposing side portions  and  extending at sides of the heel cup  to meet the lateral portion  and the medial portion , respectively, of the sole . The sides of the heel portion  each include an opening  formed through the sole  which exposes the upper . The opening  of the sole  allows articulation of the heel portion  and provides ventilation to the rear portion  of the footwear . The sides  and  and the upper portion  of the heel  essentially wrap the heel and a portion of the ankle of the wearer with the durable, protective material of the sole .A bottom of the sole , as shown in , is shaped to compliment and correspond to the natural shape and configuration of the foot. The sole  includes an arch  at the mid-foot portion  proximate to the medial side . The sole  further includes a heel pad  and a fore-foot pad  respectively disposed at the rear portion  and at the fore-foot portion  of the sole . Additionally, the sole  includes toe pads  at each of the toe portions . The pads , , and  comprise areas of the sole  which are contoured to replicate the natural pads formed at the bottom of the feet. The precise contouring and curvature of the pads , , and , and of the remaining portions of the bottom of the sole , are shown by contour lines . The pads , , and , may be integrally formed with the sole , i.e., the material forming the sole  is made thicker in designated areas in order to delimit the pads , , and . Alternatively, the pads , , and  may be formed separately form the sole  and mounted thereon by adhesive bonding, thermal bonding, etc. In use, the heel pad , fore-foot pad , and toe pads  serve to support and protect the bottom of the foot of a wearer to walking, running, etc. Additionally, the contoured effect of the pads , , and  provide the wearer with the natural feeling of walking, running, etc. in the barefoot state.Still further alternatively, the sole  may be formed with a consistent thickness throughout and may simply be molded and shaped so as to mimic and trace the natural pads and contouring of the foot. That is, the sole may be of uniform thickness and may include contouring  in order to precisely trace and conform to the natural shape and curvature of the foot.The contouring  of the sole  provides the wearer with the natural feeling of walking, running, etc. in the barefoot state. The sole  is merely a thin layer providing sufficient protection of the foot from hazards on the ground but yet is sufficiently thin to provide the wearer with a direct and enhanced haptic response relative to the ground. That is, the thinness of the sole and its precise conformity to the natural shape of the foot (especially with respect to the individual toe portions , pad areas , , , and arch ) allow for an increased and enhanced tactile engagement of the foot upon the ground. In this way, the foot is allowed to move upon the ground naturally, as if barefoot, but yet the foot remains protected by the unique footwear .The bottom of the sole  further includes traction features  disposed at various areas on and extending in various directions across the sole . These traction features  may comprise indentations of various sizes and/or shapes formed into the sole  so as to provide traction to the wearer. Further, the fraction features  may comprise narrow lines cut into the bottom of the sole  which open to a greater width when the sole  is flexed during walking, running, etc. so as to provide traction during movement of the wearer.The bottom of the sole  further includes razor cut siping  disposed at various areas on and extending in various directions across the sole . This siping  comprises narrow lines or slits cut or otherwise formed into the bottom of the sole . The siping is configured to open to a greater width when the sole  is flexed during walking, running, etc., so as to provide increased flexibility of the sole . That is, the siping  acts as a plurality of hinges which allow for articulation of the sole  during use and movement of the footwear . Additionally and/or alternatively, the siping  providing increased gripping and traction of the sole  during use and movement of the footwear . The siping  may be disposed regularly across the entire surface area of the bottom of the sole  or may be disposed in discrete areas, as desired. The individual lines/slits forming the siping  may be shaped in a longitudinal manner, or may be curved, angled, etc. An exemplary “zig-zag” siping pattern  is shown in . The siping  is shown in  as being disposed is random representative areas on the bottom of the sole . This disposition of the siping  is merely exemplary and, as stated above, the siping may be formed as and where desired across the sole .The razor cut siping  contributes to the overall enhanced haptic response provided by the foot wear . As described, the siping  provides the sole with increased flexibility. This advantageously allows the sole  to bend and flex in immediate response to movements of the foot. Thus, as stated previously, the wearer of the footwear  is provided with a feeling of being barefoot but yet is protected from ground hazards by the unique footwear .The upper  includes a collar  extending around an opening though which the wearer inserts the foot into the footwear . The collar  may include an element (not shown) which draws the upper  toward the foot of the wearer to keep the footwear  securely on the foot. The element of the collar  may comprise an elastic element which pulls the upper  toward the center of the opening.

                "This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/355,643 filed Jun. 17, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference.The invention relates to articles of footwear useful for touring or commuting by bicycle.When riding a bicycle, the largest force produced by the bicyclist is transmitted from the knee, through the foot to the bicycle pedal. A recreational bicyclist typically reproduces the pedaling force about 4,500 to about 7,500 times an hour. Unlike many bicycle shoes designed for road bicycle racing, mountain biking or commuter biking shoes typically have recessed cleats and a more flexible sole designed to allow the cyclist to comfortably walk or run when they dismount the bicycle. The flexible rubber sole, while flexible and cushioning for walking or running, unfortunately leads to inefficiencies and a loss of energy expended by the rider when energy from the rider's foot to the pedal, energy is lost in compression or flexing of the sole of the shoe between the rider's foot and the pedal. Though a completely rigid sole material renders a bicycling shoe more efficient by reducing energy loss, it is difficult to use when the rider dismounts the bicycle, for example, during portions of a mountain bike race or while commuting by bicycle.Thus, there is a desire in the art for a bicycling shoe that can both efficiently transfer energy between the riders' foot and the pedal, while remaining flexible and providing sufficient cushion for comfortable running or walking when the wearer is off of the bicycle.The present invention provides bicycling shoes, having dual rigidity materials in the soles that are comfortable for walking while providing efficient energy transfer from the rider to the pedal when bicycling. The sole of the invention allows for more rigid or stiff materials in the pedal or cleat region of the shoe, proximate the metatarsal region of the rider's foot, thereby minimizing the energy loss experienced between the rider's foot and pedal when the rider is bicycling. The shoe sole of the invention allows for less rigid or stiff (i.e. more flexible) materials in the heel and toe regions of the foot, providing for greater flexibility and comfort, injury prevention and ease of use when the rider is running or walking dismounted from the bicycle.It will be appreciated that with respect to most materials used in the fabrication of athletic shoes, and particularly bicycle shoes, the stiffness and rigidity of the material corresponds directly with its density. That is, with respect to most materials, particularly plastic/polymeric materials, the greater the density of the material, the greater is the stiffness/rigidity of the material. It should also be understood, however, that this relationship between density and rigidity does not hold for across every material that can be used in the fabrication of athletic shoes.Other features, utilities and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description of embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.The present invention is drawn to an athletic shoe sole that provides enhanced comfort while walking and efficient energy transfer from foot to bicycle pedal when bicycling.depict embodiments of the present invention.  shows a bicycling shoe  including an outersole , an upper , and a midsole  having at least two materials of different densities. The upper , may include a closure system , that can be any system capable of securing the shoe  to the riders' foot. The closure system may include shoelaces, a plurality of hook and loop (Velcro™) straps, zippers, and/or cords in conjunction with a dial to tighten the cords with even force across the throat of the shoe .The upper  is attached to the midsole , which is attached to the outersole . As used throughout this specification, attachments may be made by conventional methods known in the art, such as stitching, welding and adhesive bonding. The upper  of the shoe  is composed of one or more durable materials. Preferably, the durable material comprises one or more material(s) including but not limited to natural or synthetic leather, a polymeric material, a polymeric mixture, a polymeric alloy, a laminate, a natural or synthetic textile material, a mesh material, or a combination thereof. Preferably, the durable material is a flexible, that is, the material has substantial flexibility to provide tightening and/or securing of the upper  about the riders' foot by the closure system . In one configuration, the upper  (optionally including a tongue ) is composed of two or more durable materials. For example, the toe box  may be composed of one material (such as a mesh material) while the reminder of the upper , or any other section of the upper , is composed of another material. The upper  is suitable for providing manufacturer, team or sponsor logos, as desired.The upper  optionally contains a plurality of vent voids  that provide for fluid and air flow into and out of the interior cavity . At least most, if not all, of these vent voids  are positioned about the tongue , toe box , vamp and quarter of the bicycling shoe . In one embodiment, venting voids  are positioned about the tongue , vamp and quarter of the bicycling shoe . But it should be understood that the venting voids  may be placed in any position on the bicycling shoe . Furthermore, the venting voids  may be any suitable shape or size. The upper may also optionally include advertising, such as for a brand, team or other advertisement.As used herein the term bicycling shoe means both left and right forms of the bicycling shoe . Furthermore, the bicycling shoe  comprises a bicycling shoe designed to fit a man, a woman, or both. The bicycling shoe  may have a shoe size according to any international shoe size designation standard. For example, without limitation, the shoes of the invention may have a size designation from the United States standard shoe size designations of: 5, 5½, 6, 6½, 7, 7½, 8, 8½, 9, 9½, 10, 10½, 11, 11½, 12, 12½, 13, 13½, 14, 14½, 15, 15½, 16, 16½, 17, 17½, 18, 18½, 19, 19½, and 20 and a width from the United States standard widths of: AAA, AA, A, B, C, D, E, EE, EEE, EEEE, F and G.The sole  includes a midsole  and an outersole  and may include an insole being in an opposing relationship to the outersole . In one embodiment, the midsole  is composed of at least two materials having different material densities. The sole  may also include inserts. These inserts may be located throughout the sole . By way of example, the inserts may be located in the arch or heel region of the sole. Inserts may also be located in the metatarsal region and positioned such that they do not interfere with a cleat positioned on the bottom of the shoe.shows a bottom view of a midsole  of one embodiment of the invention. The midsole  may comprise at least two materials having different material densities. The cleat region  spans at least a portion of the metatarsal region of the midsole  where the sole of the shoe may be engaged with a bicycle pedal and may be any suitable shape. The cleat region  of the midsole , comprises a material that is dense, and thus more rigid than the material comprising at least the rear midsole region  of the midsole . The denser material in the cleat region  allows for reduced energy loss and increased efficiency when the cyclist is pedaling. The dense material of the cleat region  may be any suitably durable material, including but not limited to, a polymer, a metal, wood, a composite, a foam, a reinforced polymer, or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the cleat region  of the midsole  contains a rigid plastic material or polymer composite. In another embodiment, the cleat region  of the midsole  contains a plurality of carbon fibers, and more preferably, a plurality of carbon fibers configured in a unidirectional alignment or layer to form a light, rigid material. Preferably, the material comprising the cleat region  of the midsole  is a lightweight material. The cleat region  of the midsole  may be any suitable shape or size to transfer force from the rider to the pedal. The cleat region  may also be configured to receive or include a cleat for attaching to a pedal. The cleat region  may extend into other regions of the midsole . Furthermore, the thickness of the cleat region  may vary.also illustrates additional regions of the midsole , including the central midsole , the rear midsole , and the fore midsole . The material of the central midsole , the rear midsole  and/or the fore midsole  may differ from the material of the cleat region . The material may be a lower rigidity material that provides comfort and flexibility to the rider when off of the bicycle, while not interfering with the high rigidity material of the cleat region . In other embodiments, the materials of the central midsole , the rear midsole  and/or the fore midsole , may be the same lower rigidity material or they may be composed of different materials or different formulations/densities of the same material in order to form materials having different rigidity or stiffness compared to one another. In optional embodiments, the higher rigidity material of the cleat region  may extend to the central midsole  and even to portions of the rear midsole . Alternatively, the central midsole  may be composed of the same low rigidity material as the rear midsole  and/or the fore midsole .In a specific embodiment, the fore midsole , and the rear midsole  comprise a low rigidity material that is comfortable to walk or run in should the rider dismount the bicycle, while the cleat region  and the central midsole , contains a higher rigidity, rigid material that allows for efficient transfer of force from the rider's foot to the pedal through the central midsole  and cleat region  of the bicycling shoe.In each of these embodiments, the less dense material can be any suitable material, including but not limited to, leather, a polyurethane foam, canvas, rubber, EVA, polyester, nylon, nylon textiles, thermoplastic polyurethane, composite, a polymer, foam or combination thereof, or any other suitable material or similar material to provide an appropriate combination of support and comfort to the user. The low rigidity material may contain a unidirectional carbon fiber laminate, which may also contain one or more of a polymeric material, a polymeric mixture, a polymeric alloy or combinations of these polymeric materials. The midsole  can be formed as one continuous piece containing the high rigidity and the low rigidity materials, separated into distinct regions of the midsole , or it may be formed as two or more distinct pieces that are nested or connected together to form the midsole having distinct regions of lower and higher rigidity.Optional embodiments that are also illustrated in  allow for one or more of a heel insert , a metatarsal insert , and/or an arch insert , or any combination thereof, within the midsole . In these optional embodiments, a heel insert , and/or a metatarsal insert , and/or an arch insert  may be individually or collectively incorporated into the midsole . The heel insert  can provide additional cushioning and support to the heel portion of the midsole . The metatarsal insert  can add additional rigidity and support to a portion of the metatarsal region. The arch insert  can provide added support to the arch area of the wearer's foot. The inserts of the invention may be chosen to adjust the level of support in the metatarsal, arch and heel regions. In a preferred embodiment, the inserts generally have the same shape as the insert slot that they fit into so that they can be inserted into the slot and substantially fill the slot in order to provide support and comfort for the user. The inserts may be used individually, or they may be stacked with other inserts to vary the thickness of the inserts. The inserts may be any suitable material, but are preferably a substantially pliable material, such as a foam, including a ethylene vinyl acetate foam or other open cell foams or cork or other polymer materials. The inserts may also be made of rubber, canvas, leather, EVA, nylon, polyester, nylon textiles, thermoplastic polyurethane, composites, laminates or other suitable structural material or combinations thereof. The insert(s) may be colored, or may be translucent. In certain embodiments, it is preferable for the inserts to be substantially rigid so as to transfer power, for example, while the user is pedaling a bicycle. In this configuration, the inserts may be a substantially rigid material, including but not limited to a polymer, a metal or wood. Furthermore, the inserts may contain additional materials or material layers for antimicrobial or antifungal protection, or fragrances.The metatarsal insert , the arch insert  and the heel insert  can individually be incorporated into the midsole  of the shoe. The metatarsal insert , the arch insert  and the heel insert  may also individually be present or absent in the midsole such that these inserts can be combined in varying combinations in the midsole or all of these inserts may be incorporated into the midsole. These inserts may also assist in absorbing shock in the sole of the shoe when the rider is walking or running in the shoe, when dismounted from the bicycle.

                "This invention relates to the design and construction of a novel removable boot attachment for protecting workboot shanks and soles.The present invention describes a wedge shaped device, constructed of any suitable material, including but not limited to metals, plastics and rubbers, removably fastened to the underside of a boot to protect the boot shank and the user's foot from the impact force of kicking a shovel or other object. The device may be removably affixed to the boot bottom via straps, a hook and loop closure system (a/k/a “Velcro”) or other suitable means.While working with shovels or other digging implements, workers will often place considerable force on the longitudal and transverse arch portion of a foot and its accompanying footwear. This area is also known as the shank and is that portion of the footwear sole immediately preceding the heel. Kicking of a shovel or other tool with this portion of the foot is common and results in many types of foot injuries and in accelerated wear of the footwear sole. Similarly, this portion of the foot and footwear is often used to kick or provide leverage in any number of physical activities. Linemen (pole climbers) in particular, rely upon this isolated portion of the foot and footwear to support the entire weight of their bodies and workload when ascending or descending poles utilizing gaff hooks (pole spikes). In the above examples, the undue force and stress on this portion of the foot and footwear creates a higher risk of injury to the user and damage to the footwear.Reinforced work boots are available to help reduce the risk of injury or damage. In the case of linemen, steel shanks are utilized in the linemen boot arches to help support the lineman's weight on the gaff hook. While the steel shank may reduce the stress of isolating weight on the narrow gaff hook, it does not reduce the accelerated wear on this portion of the boot sole caused by repeated climbing activities. Furthermore, a steel shank does little to nothing in protecting a foot from the shock and vibration transmitted through the boot when the arch is utilized in digging or kicking activities.In view of the prior arts' shortcomings, it is thus desirable to create a user replaceable, removable boot attachment designed to protect a boot sole from damage caused by stress to the arch portion of the sole and to further protect a user's foot arch from the stress of various activities as described herein.Shown in  is the device () which is substantially wedge shaped and sized to fit to the underside of a boot sole. One side () abuts adjacent a boot heel and may be referred to as the rear. The top surface () abuts the boot sole and the bottom surface () is exposed to the walking or work surface when installed on the boot. The bottom surface may contain ribs to offer a secure and non-slip contact point for climbing or applying leverage against a tool. A slot () may be cut into the device for purposes of securing said device to a boot with a strap.Shown in  are side views of the shank guard. The top surface (), bottom surface () and boot heel or back surface () being indicated therein. The slot () is indicated and ribs on the bottom surface are indicated.Shown in  are elevation views from the top side () indicating the slot () of the shank guard.Shown in  is the shank guard with a rubber cushion () affixed to the top side () of the shank guard.Shown in  are the shank guard with a hook and loop closure system () affixed to the top side () of the shank guard. The closure system () may be mated with a complementary closure system attached to the footwear in lieu of, or in addition to, other securing means.Shown in  are four views of the shank guard and two strap system as would be positionally related, but omitting the footwear.  shows a front view wherein the shank guard () has a first strap () passing through a slot (), wrapping vertically around the instep/toe section of a boot (omitted) and secured by a buckle () and keeper (). Other closure means such as a hook and loop closure system typically known by the trademark “VELCRO” may be utilized for securing the first strap in a closed position. A second strap () is secured to said first strap () and wraps around the ankle/heel portion of the footwear and may be secured by similar means. The device slot () may be manufactured with an opening as pictured along the top surface of said device in  to facilitate insertion and removal of first strap ().Shown in  is a bottom view of the shank guard and strap system with the shank guard () bottom () being evident with ribs or ridges, first strap () shown in position through the device slot () (not shown), and second strap () attached to first strap (). Second strap () is shown with extra length being securely adjusted by a hook and loop closure system at points between ′ and ″. Point ″ approximates the rear ankle or heel area of the footwear (omitted).Shown in  is a side view of the shank guard () with first strap () through slot () and second strap () positioned on first strap (). Buckle () would be positioned approximately atop the instep/toe portion of the footwear (omitted).shows a top view of the shank guard and two strap system assembly.Shown in  is a further elevation view of the shank guard and two strap system in positional relationship with footwear omitted.Shown in  is a side view of the shank guard positioned on a boot and secured through its slot with a first strap wrapped about the instep/toe portion of the boot and secured with a buckle, and a second strap, secured to the first strap, the second strap wrapped about the ankle/heel portion of the boot.The descriptions and embodiments described and pictured are instructive of the device and securing attachments and it is noted that equivalent structures may be adapted and utilized to accomplish the intended purposes. For example, any shoe or other footwear may be substituted for a boot. The shank guard may be constructed of metals, plastics, rubbers, polymers or any combination thereof, suitable to withstand its intended function. Similarly, any securing means which may allow attachment and removal of the shank guard from footwear without functional damage to the footwear may be suitably substituted for the strap and hook and loop closure attachments. Such securing means may include cements, glues, spikes or tabs designed to fit into a complementary slot cut into a boot heel."

The excavating control mechanism may continuously modify the excavating parameters to align the resultant force with the pointed cutting element's central axis regardless of ground condition. In embodiments, where the excavating assembly, comprises a drill bit with blade, at least one blade may comprise a measuring mechanism positioned in its thickness.is a perspective diagram of an embodiment of a drilling rig  comprising an auger assembly  suspended from a drilling mast  on a drill string . The drilling rig  may comprise a plurality of pulleys  over which a suspension cable  passes. The suspension cable  may be wound up on a rotating wheel  positioned on the back of a truck  with equal length on each turning. The auger assembly  may be lowered down or pulled up by utilizing the rotating wheel  and the pulley mechanism . A first torque transducer  may be positioned at the end of a shaft of the auger assembly  and a second torque transducer  may be positioned at the end of a shaft of the rotating wheel . The first torque transducer  may measure the torque applied to each pointed cutting element  in the auger assembly . The second torque transducer  may measure weight loaded to each pointed cutting element .The method of measuring the weight loaded to each cutting element  may comprise the step of measuring the torque applied to the rotating wheel  in the direction of rotation. The weight loaded to the cutting elements  may be calculated by using the formula:Weight on bit(WOB)=(weight of the auger assembly 120)−(tangential force on the wheel 150×radius of the wheel 150)The weight of the auger assembly  and the radius of the wheel  are fixed; thus, the changing the tangential force on the wheel is the primary mechanism for modifying WOB.discloses the auger assembly  comprising a plurality of pointed cutting elements . The pointed cutting elements  may comprise a wear resistant tip comprising a superhard material bonded to a cemented metal carbide substrate. The super hard material may comprise a material selected from a group comprising diamond, sintered polycrystalline diamond, natural diamond, synthetic diamond, vapor deposited diamond, silicon bonded diamond, cobalt bonded diamond, thermally stable diamond, polycrystalline diamond with a binder concentration of 1 to 40 weight percent, infiltrated diamond, layered diamond, monolithic diamond, polished diamond, course diamond, fine diamond, cubic boron nitride, diamond impregnated matrix, diamond impregnated carbide, metal catalyzed diamond, or combinations thereof.discloses the auger assembly  in contact with a formation . The pointed cutting element  may cut through the formation , thereby removing dirt and debris out of the formation via blades  of the auger assembly . The cutting element  may experience a plurality of forces. The cutting element  may experience a normal force  acting substantially perpendicular to the tip of the cutting element  from the weight of the excavator assembly. The cutting element  may also experience torque  that loads the element from the side. The combination of these forces may be considered a vector force. The formation loads the formation in an equal and opposite manner, resulting in a resultant vector force loaded to the pointed cutting element.When the vector force does not align with the central axis of the cutting element, then the resultant vector forces do not either. Since the cutting element is pointed, the non-aligned forces may load the cutting element in a way that the cutting element in a direction that the cutting element is weak. For example, a pointed cutting element does not have a large cross section at its apex, so a load that transverses the apex meets little resistance from the apex's cross section. On the other hand, when the load is substantially aligned with the central axis of the cutter, the entire length of the cutting element may buttress the apex again the load.The resultant force  may vary depending on a number of excavating parameters such as weight loaded to each cutting element, torque, rotational velocity, rate of penetration and type of formation.The excavating parameters may be modified to substantially align the resultant force  with the pointed cutting element's central axis. The pointed cutting element  is believed to have the characteristic of having its highest impact resistance along its central axis. At least one excavating parameter may be modified to align the resultant force  with the pointed cutting element's central axis. The electronic means may continuously modify the excavating parameters to align the resultant force  with the pointed cutting element's central axis regardless of formation  conditions.For purposes of this disclosure, an aligned resultant force is within + or − ten degrees of the axis in some embodiments. In other embodiments, substantially aligning may be within five degrees. Preferably, an aligned resultant force is within 2 degrees.discloses a method of modifying at least one excavating parameter to align the resultant force with the pointed cutting element's central axis. For instances, the weight loaded to each cutting element  may be too high. In such cases, the resultant force  may misalign vertically. To adjust the resultant force, the weight loaded to each cutting element  may be decreased to shift the vector force to substantially align with the cutting element's axis. By shifting the vector force, the resultant force  also realigned along the central axis.Referring to , the torque  may be too high causing the cutting element to be side loaded. The torque  may be decreased to align the resultant force  with the pointed cutting element's central axis as illustrated by the solid arrows. In some embodiments, both torque  and weight loaded to each cutting element  may be modified to align the resultant force with the pointed cutting element's central axis.Frequently, natural and man-made formations vary in hardness and composition. As the formation's characteristics vary, so may the resultant force angles and strengths. For example, as a drill bit transitions between a soft and a hard formation, the stresses on the cutting elements may change, resulting in a change in the excavating parameters to keep the resultant forces substantially aligned with the element's central axis.Referring to , a cross-sectional diagram of an embodiment of a pointed cutting element  is disclosed. The pointed cutting element  may comprise a plurality of measuring mechanisms such as strain gauges  positioned inside a pick. The strain gauges  may be mounted on a pre-tensioned strain bolt. Such an arrangement is believed to measure both compression and tension acting on the cutting element  more precisely. The cutting element  may comprise small diameter bore holes .

In some cases, the depth of cut of the formation may be too high. In such cases, rotational velocity may be increased to align the resultant force with the cutting element's central axis. Also, the weight loaded to each cutting element may be decreased if the rotational velocity is near its maximum limit. In some cases, the depth of cut may be too low. In such cases, the cutting elements may not induce cracks in the formation, thereby making cut ineffective. The weight loaded to each cutting element may be increased to align the resultant force with the cutting element's central axis. Also, the rotational velocity may be decreased if the weight loaded to each cutting element is already near its maximum limit.In some cases, the resultant force may be too vertical or too horizontal or too offset from the cutting element's central axis. In such cases, the resultant force may be aligned with the cutting element's central axis by modifying at least one excavating parameter as explained in the previous paragraphs. In some cases, a trajectory angle of the cutting element may be too steep, thereby creating too low backstage offset clearance. Thus, sides of the forward end of the cutting element may come in contact with the formation, thereby eroding the sides of the cutting element. In such cases, the weight loaded to each cutting element may be increased to create sufficient backstage offset clearance. The backstage offset clearance may also depend on rate of penetration of the drilling assembly. In some embodiments, the rate of penetration may be decreased to create sufficient backstage offset clearance.Whereas the present invention has been described in particular relation to the drawings attached hereto, it should be understood that other and further modifications apart from those shown or suggested herein, may be made within the scope and spirit of the present invention."

                "The present invention relates to an excavating device for excavating ground under water, which device comprises a floating device which can be moved in a navigating direction and to which a drag head is attached which during use is dragged over the bottom or hangs downward and herein loosens soil, and a suction conduit which connects to the drag head and which discharges the loosened soil. The invention likewise relates to a method for excavating ground under water using this excavating device.An excavating device according to the preamble is known from EP-A-0892116. EP-A-0892116 describes an excavating device of the trailing suction hopper dredger type. This comprises a vessel to which a drag head is fixed by means of a drag pipe. The drag head is connected to a suction conduit and comprises a visor which is open toward the bottom for dredging. On the visor a series of teeth is arranged on a toothed beam extending in a direction at a right angle to the direction of movement of the drag head. During excavation or dredging the drag head with drag pipe and suction conduit is lowered under water at an oblique angle with a winch at the rear of the trailing suction hopper dredger, until the drag head makes contact with the bottom or hangs downward. During the travel of the trailing suction hopper dredger the drag head is dragged over the bottom under water in the direction of navigation, wherein the soil is loosened by the teeth engaging on the bottom. The loosened soil is suctioned away via the suction conduit, for instance to a storage space present on the trailing suction hopper dredger. During the dredging the drag head exerts pressure on the bottom due to the relatively high weight of the components situated under water, and due to the suction force developed by the suction conduit.The known excavating device is capable in a short time of excavating large quantities of ground under water. The accuracy of the dredging is however capable of improvement, or is only made possible through the use of expensive and complicated GPS-like control systems such as the DPDT (Dynamic Positioning/Dynamic Tracking) system known to the skilled person in the art. Owing to inaccuracies it may be the case that parts of the area for dredging are not excavated or not properly excavated, whereby the trailing suction hopper dredger must retrace its path. This is time-consuming, thereby reducing the efficiency of the trailing suction hopper dredger. Efficiency is understood in the context of this application to mean the volume of ground dredged per unit of time and per unit of power. The reduced efficiency is caused because in such a case the trailing suction hopper dredger will have to be manoeuvred a great deal, wherein the accuracy of operation is greatly dependent on the experience of the crew and on the power available in the trailing suction hopper dredger. During manoeuvring the trailing suction hopper dredger travels around with downward hanging drag pipe without soil being suctioned up. The same problem otherwise occurs during clearing of local shallows resulting for instance from tracks formed by the drag head.The present invention has for its object to provide an excavating device which can obviate the above stated drawbacks and with which in particular dredging is possible with greater accuracy than is possible with the known excavating device.The excavating device according to the invention has for this purpose the feature that it is provided with a steering device for moving the drag head out of the navigating direction. By providing a steering device according to the invention for partially autonomous steering of the drag head it becomes possible to steer the drag head over the ground to a desired zone without it being necessary to manoeuvre the floating device, in particular a trailing suction hopper dredger, to this zone. The desired zone for dredging is hereby not only reached more quickly, this moreover takes place using considerably less power and with greater accuracy. Considerably less fuel is used and COemitted as a result of the greatly reduced power requirement, this reducing the impact on the environment.The excavating device can in principle comprise any floating device suitable for the purpose, as long as it can be propelled. Suitable vessels comprise for instance a pontoon moved forward using an auxiliary vessel, a ship along which a second ship with hold space is moored, a cutter suction dredger, a trailing suction hopper dredger and other suitable floating devices. The floating device preferably comprises a trailing suction hopper dredger.A drag head for a trailing suction hopper dredger can have a weight of more than 20 tonnes. During use the drag head is moreover suctioned with great force onto the ground surface due to the suction action of the suction conduit. It would therefore seem that great power is required to move such a drag head. Surprisingly, it has been found that not a particularly large amount of power is necessary to move the drag head out of the navigating direction. The steering means hereby require moderate power, at least related to the power usually applied in the dredging sector.Although not strictly necessary, a preferred embodiment of the excavating device according to the invention comprises control means for operating the steering device from the floating device. The accuracy of the excavation is further increased with such a remote control. A crew member on the floating vehicle generally has equipment at his disposal with which the ground surface, and more specifically the depth profile of the ground surface (therefore the unevenness of the ground surface) can be visualized from the waterline. Because this takes place in real-time, this crew member generally has a view of the position of the drag head. The present variant makes it possible to adjust the position of the drag head on the basis of the knowledge of the depth profile of the ground surface.The steering device according to the invention can be embodied in many ways. A first embodiment of the excavating device according to the invention is provided with a steering device comprising a traction cable which leads from an attachment point on the drag head or on a lower part of the suction pipe, via a support frame arranged on the floating device, to a winch or winding gear likewise arranged on the floating device. The drag head is for instance steered in the port direction by tightening the traction cable on the port side.A second embodiment of the excavating device according to the invention is provided with a steering device comprising a revolving body such as a caterpillar track, the caterpillar track extending on the contact side of the drag head with the ground surface, this substantially transversely of the dragging direction. The drag head is steered to the right by rotating the revolving body in clockwise direction, and the drag head is steered to the left by rotating the revolving body in counter-clockwise direction.A third embodiment of the excavating device according to the invention is provided with a steering device comprising a jet pipe, the axis of which runs substantially transversely of the dragging direction. When a high-pressure jet is released in a jet pipe with jet nozzle on the port side, the drag head will be moved in the direction of the starboard side, and vice versa.A fourth embodiment of the excavating device according to the invention is provided with a steering device comprising a propeller, the rotation axis of which extends substantially transversely of the dragging direction. When the propeller rotates the drag head will be moved in the forward direction of the propeller.A fifth embodiment of the excavating device according to the invention is provided with a steering device which is adapted to apply a friction force to the bottom which is distributed unequally over the width of the friction surface. The unequal distribution of the friction results in a force which does not lie in the axis of the main direction of movement followed by the travelling ship. A resultant force is created by this play of forces which causes the drag head to move in a direction differing from the main direction of movement followed by the travelling ship. The unequal distribution of the friction force on the friction surface can be obtained by way of example by providing on both outer ends of the drag head a hook which can be pressed under control into the bottom or lifted therefrom. When this hook presses into the bottom, the friction force on the bottom is increased locally and provides for the desired reaction force.A sixth embodiment of the excavating device according to the invention is provided with a steering device comprising means adapted to shift the reaction force relative to the middle of the drag head as a result of the downward pressure of the drag head on the bottom, whereby the drag head can make a transverse movement. This downward pressure has multiple causes, the main one being the force of gravity, but also the pressure drop over the head caused by the suction process. By shifting the centre of forces (centre of gravity in the case of gravity) of the drag head from the neutral point on the axis of the drag head, a part of the ground reaction force can be shifted in the transverse direction. This corresponds to an apparently lateral force on the drag head. A particularly suitable steering device comprises means adapted to rotate the drag head about the axis of the suction pipe. Both the reaction force of the ground and the friction force of the bottom can hereby be influenced. For this purpose the suction pipe more preferably comprises rotation means for forced rotation of the part of the suction pipe in contact with the drag head, for instance in the rotating joint of the suction pipe, this being a known component of a suction pipe. A suitable rotation means comprises a hydraulic cylinder engaging on the rotating joint. The rotation of the suction pipe part changes the weight distribution of the drag head on the bottom, whereby on the one hand the gravitational force acquires a transverse component, and on the other higher friction occurs locally which provides for friction force, and a lateral movement. It is also possible to have control means in the form of a hydraulic cylinder or other means engage on for instance the suction pipe so that this latter can be pushed away from the floating device, whereby the drag head will move out of the navigating direction. Such a control means can for instance engage on the suction pipe at the level of the deck of the floating device, or just below the cardan joint generally situated below the centre of the suction pipe.A particularly advantageous seventh embodiment of the excavating device according to the invention is provided with a steering device comprising a rudder blade, wherein the rudder blade extends in a substantially vertical plane and during use engages with a side edge thereof in the ground or in the water. The rudder blade—or if desired a plurality of rudder blades—can be connected to the drag pipe and/or to the drag head, for instance to the visor or to the cap of the drag head. The correct placing of the rudder blade will in many cases depend on the distribution of forces at that location. The rudder blade is preferably mounted in front of the heel plate of the drag head, so that during dragging the rudder blade engages on the flow and/or on the ground surface upstream of the heel plate (and the visor). The forward movement of the floating device, in particular the trailing suction hopper dredger, creates during dredging a reaction force on the rudder blade which pushes the drag pipe suspended from a winch cable in a direction determined by the position of the rudder blade. The drag head is in this way displaced relative to the trailing suction hopper dredger.During use the rudder blade engages with a side edge thereof in the ground or exerts a reaction force on the surrounding water. For this purpose the rudder blade must preferably be at a sufficiently low position that during dredging the rudder blade is pressed into the ground under the weight of the drag head and suction pipe. Despite the fact that the rudder blade cuts through the ground during use, the associated friction is not found to be significantly greater than is the case for a drag head embodied without rudder blade. As stated, the surrounding water can also provide a reaction force on the rudder blade.The rudder blade is preferably steered by control means comprising a piston, or hydraulic cylinder, which engages on the rudder blade. For control thereof the cylinder is connected in this embodiment electronically (and optionally wirelessly) to the floating device, in particular the trailing suction hopper dredger. A hydraulic cylinder in particular allows simple and reliable operation of the rudder blade from the bridge of the trailing suction hopper dredger, for instance by the crew member also monitoring the movement of the drag pipe. All the usual auxiliary means, such as for instance a control screen on which the profile of the ground surface is visualized, are advantageous here.The rudder blade according to the invention must be sufficiently strong to be able to withstand the forces acting thereon. The forces to be overcome lie typically in the order of magnitude of the force exerted by the drag head on the ground surface. For a typical trailing suction hopper dredger such a force is in the order of magnitude of 20 to 30 tonnes, at least when the force is exerted at the position of the drag head, this being preferred. A hydraulic cylinder with a diameter of 15 to 20 cm is able to overcome such forces. Cylinders of such a size are also applied to operate the visor of the known drag head.The dimensions of the rudder blade, and more specifically the length thereof, and the depth over which the rudder blade presses into the ground, are in principle determined by the resistance which the ground can cause. It is for instance expected in the case of a rudder blade that a ground surface (such as sand), which provides much resistance to a displacement of the drag head, requires a smaller rudder blade than a ground surface providing less resistance (such as silt for instance). A sand-like ground will after all produce a higher reaction pressure on the rudder blade than a silt-like ground. On the other hand however, the friction force which the drag head encounters in a sand-like ground will be higher than in a silt-like ground, which in turn indicates a larger rudder blade. Since the two effects more or less cancel each other out, the dimensions of the rudder blade required for a silt or sand ground are roughly of the same order of magnitude. It is thus possible to apply the same rudder blade for different types of ground, this being an additional advantage.The drag head can in principle be removed any desired distance away from the trailing suction hopper dredger in the above indicated manner. The maximum possible distance or deviation is determined by, among other factors, the length of the suspending wire of the drag pipe and the angle the suspending wire makes with the horizontal. It is advantageous to provide means to enable measurement of particularly the suspending wire angle. It is hereby possible to avoid the drag pipe becoming too far removed from the trailing suction hopper dredger or even detaching therefrom.As the drag head becomes further removed, the drag head must preferably maintain contact with the ground surface. This can be realized by lengthening the suspending wire of the drag pipe so that this contact is maintained. Use can advantageously be made here of a per se known swell compensating device. Such a device ensures that the drag head continues to press with the same force on the ground surface during dredging in swell. The same device can also be utilized to ensure that the drag head continues to press with the same force on the ground surface when this drag head is removed from the navigating direction of the trailing suction hopper dredger.In yet another preferred embodiment the excavating device is provided with a plurality of steering devices, of which examples have been given above, for the purpose of moving the drag head out of the navigating direction. It is thus possible to provide the drag head with a rudder blade, and the suction pipe with a propeller or traction cable. A plurality of steering devices of the same type can also be arranged on the excavating device. Applying a plurality of steering means, also in combination, has the advantage that the reaction force exerted on a steering means by the ground or flow will be lower.The invention likewise relates to a device for controlling the steering device. The device comprises a central computer which is connected directly or via a digital network to the steering device and which is adapted to perform a method comprising at least the steps of:The computer is loaded for this purpose according to the invention with a computer program which comprises program instructions for setting the steering device. The advantages of such a device allow calculation of an optimum. The device according to the invention collects the information via the (digital) network in the form of incoming signals which come from instruments, such as a GPS system, DTM or a DPDT system (non-limitative list), incorporated in the network. These signals are processed, after which the device transmits control signals via the digital network to the steering device for the purpose of controlling this latter, or wherein information is shown on a digital screen, on the basis of which an operator carries out control of the steering device. The computer calculates the control, which preferably comprises at least that route of the drag head which minimizes the optimum criterion (the ‘optimum’ route). The thus calculated control is continuously adjusted by the computer as a function of the changes recorded by the instruments. According to the invention the computer calculation takes into account, among other factors, the position, the processing rate, the navigation speed and the technical possibilities of the trailing suction hopper dredger, and this preferably controls a trailing suction hopper dredger by modifying for instance the position of the visor, the position of the rudder, the position of the drag head and so forth.Referring to , a drag head  according to the invention is shown. Drag head  comprises a visor  which is dragged over a bottom  for dredging. A suction conduit  is connected to visor  via cap . Drag head  further comprises a heel plate  with which drag head  supports on bottom  during dredging. Visor  is provided with toothed beam  (or other excavating device) which incorporates a number of teeth. The toothed beam extends substantially perpendicularly of the dragging direction . According to the invention the drag head  is also provided with a steering device in the form of a rudder blade , which in the shown embodiment variant extends in a substantially vertical plane. This plane will generally lie perpendicularly of bottom . During use rudder blade  will engage with the lower side edge  thereof in bottom , and a part thereof will penetrate into the bottom under the weight of the drag head and drag pipe. This part is shown hatched in .Rudder blade  is connected to a hydraulic cylinder  (see ) which serves as control means for rudder blade . In the shown variant hydraulic cylinder  is connected to heel plate  and on the other side to rudder blade  via a piston rod . Hydraulic cylinder  is further connected electrically to the trailing suction hopper dredger (not shown) so that it can be operated, optionally wirelessly, from this trailing suction hopper dredger. The crew member also monitoring the movement of drag pipe  can control rudder blade  making use of usual auxiliary means such as for instance a control screen on which smaller unevenness in the ground surface can be visualized. In the position of rudder blade  shown in the figure the drag head will be steered in dragging direction  as would also be the case for the known drag head. With rudder blade  in the position the drag head  will vary from the dragging direction and be steered sideways in direction . Drag head  will hereby follow a course running substantially along the line .As shown in , the suction conduit is provided in another variant with a second steering device in the form of a propeller  which, if desired, can move the drag head simultaneously with rudder blade . This provides for a still better controllability of the drag head, particularly in harder ground surfaces.Referring to , a possible embodiment is shown of a device for controlling the steering device according to the invention. The device comprises a computer (CPU) which performs optimizing calculations on the basis of information collected via the (digital) network in the form of incoming signals, coming from instruments such as a GPS system, DTM or a DPDT system (non-limitative list) incorporated in the network. Incoming signals comprise, but are not limited to, the navigating speed , the position  of the drag head and the current position  of the rudder, optionally supplemented with other relevant input data , such as for instance the technical possibilities of the trailing suction hopper dredger. The result of the calculation results at least in a control signal  for a new position of the rudder. The refreshed data are optionally visualized by sending a modified signal  to a screen or to a DPDT system.The signals (-) are processed, after which the device transmits control signals  via the digital network to the steering device for the purpose of controlling this latter, or wherein information  is shown on a digital screen, on the basis of which an operator carries out control of the steering device. The computer calculates the control , which preferably comprises at least that route of the drag head which minimizes the optimum criterion (the ‘optimum’ route). The thus calculated control  is continuously modified by the computer as a function of the changes recorded by the instruments.Referring to , a method for excavating ground () is shown, wherein a floating device in the form of a trailing suction hopper dredger () is provided. Drag head () of trailing suction hopper dredger () comprises a suction conduit () which is lowered under water at an oblique angle with a winch at the rear thereof until drag head () makes contact with the bottom (). The drag head is dragged underwater over bottom () so that soil is loosened and discharged via suction conduit (). According to the invention steering means () of drag head () are controlled by means of control means () such that drag head () moves out of the navigating direction () and follows a route (). A prior art drag head is only capable of following route (). The (desired) position () of drag head () to be reached is shown in broken lines in . The current position () of drag head () is shown in full lines. The desired position () cannot be reached by following the route () of the trailing suction hopper dredger (). The optimum criterion in the present example comprises of reaching the desired position ().The invention is not limited to the above described embodiment, and modifications could be made thereto to the extent these fall within the scope of the appended claims."

                "This disclosure is generally related to monitoring and/or documenting growth progression.Monitoring and documenting the developmental milestones of a growing child can include regularly snapping photographs as the child progresses, measuring the child against a growth chart, and weighing the child. Often, the statistics are collected in a baby album, while the photographs are collected in a photo album.Some digital cameras include an automatic timestamp attached to the image file or printed on the lace of the image. The timestamp can be used to track the age of the child in each photograph. Alternatively, or additionally, the age can be tracked and later written next to the photograph when placed in a photo album.Over a period of time, multiple photographs of the child can be taken on a particular blanket or next to a favorite toy. The constant size of the chosen item can serve as a visual comparison to maintain a record of the child's relative growth.Some toys include the ability to display changeable information. In some examples, personalized pictures or messages can be drawn or otherwise presented on toys such as washable fabric paint drawing cloths, erasable chalk boards or magnetic scribble boards, or simple digital computing devices with keypad or stylus interfaces.In a general aspect, a system for documenting the growth progression of an infant includes an indicator that identities a date associated with the infant or an age of the infant, and an object, unchangeable in size, including an element for removably attaching the indicator to the object.Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, the object is a three-dimensional toy. The object is a plush toy and the element is included on an item of apparel associated with the plush toy. The element includes one of a hook and loop fastener, a magnet, a zipper section, a snap section, a hook and eye portion, a button, a buttonhole, or a tie, and the indicator includes respective connection points for removable attachment to the element. The element includes one of a set of rails or a transparent pocket. The object further includes a second element for removably attaching a second indicator that identifies a weight or height of the infant. The indicator includes a set of numerals corresponding to the age described in relation to one of days, weeks, months, or years. The set of numerals further correspond to the age described in relation to months, and wherein the object further includes a second element for removably attaching numerals corresponding to the age in months. The system further includes at least two messages with respective connection points for removable attachment to the object, wherein a first message corresponds to the age described in relation to weeks and a second message corresponds to the age described in relation to months, and wherein the object further includes a fourth element and a fifth element for removably attaching the at least two messages. The system further includes a photograph display object including a decoration similar in appearance to the object.In another aspect, an apparatus for documenting the growth progression of an object capable of growth includes an indicator that identifies a date associated with the object, or an age of the object, and an article, unchangeable in size, comprising an element for removably attaching the indicator to the article.Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, the element includes one of a hook and loop fastener, a magnet, a zipper section, a snap section, a hook and eye portion, a button, a buttonhole, or a tie, and the indicator includes respective connection points for removable attachment to the element. The article is a three-dimensional plush toy and the element is included on an item of apparel associated with the plush toy. The element includes one of a set of rails or a transparent pocket.In another aspect, a method for documenting the growth progression of an object capable of growth includes providing an indicator that identifies a date associated with the object, or an age of the object, and providing an article, unchangeable in size, including an element for removably attaching the indicator to the article.Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, the method further includes taking a photograph of the object, the indicator, and the article at a first time, and taking a photograph of the object, the indicator, and the article at a second time, wherein the indicator indicates a different date associated with the object or a different age of the object at the second time as compared to the first time.Documenting growth, be it of an infant, a pet, or a prized orchid, can include collecting periodic photographs. Rather than depending upon a timestamp stored in the camera, or remembering to log the date on which each photo was taken, the photo can be taken next to an object, unchangeable in size, marked with, for example, a date or an age. The date or age information can be attached to the object using individual indicators, such as numerals, or connected to attachment points on the object. In this manner, the date or age can be updated at the next photo session. Because the object is unchangeable in size, each photo additionally provides a visual comparison of growth relative to the object.are diagrams illustrating images or photographs  and  taken using a plush bear  for documenting growth progression. Each photograph ,  contains an infant  next to the plush bear . The plush hear  is marked with numerals indicating the age of the infant  in weeks.As shown in , the first photograph  presents the infant  at age two weeks, as indicated by a first set of digits  “02” attached to the stomach of the plush bear . The first set of digits , in some examples, can be connected to the plush bear  using a hook and loop fastener such as Velcro® fasteners, a magnet, a zipper, a snap, a hook and eye, a button, or a tie. The first set of digits , for example, can be a portion of a full collection of indicators, provided with the plush bear , for marking the incremental age during growth. In some implementations, the first set of digits  and the connecting method used on the plush bear  allows the plush bear  to be child safe as a play toy for the infant .Below the first set of digits , the term “WEEKS” is presented on the stomach of the plush bear . In some implementations, the term “WEEKS” is interchangeable in a similar manner to the first set of digits . For example, the terms “DAYS”, “WEEKS”, “MONTHS”, and “YEARS” (and, optionally, singular versions of each) can be provided with the bear along with a collection of numerals so that, as growth progresses, the age can be incrementally updated. Alternatively, the term “WEEKS” can be stitched or printed to the plush bear .The second photograph  presents the infant  at age nineteen weeks, as indicated by a second set of digits  “19” attached to the plush bear . The infant  is visibly larger in comparison to the plush bear  than in the first photograph . In addition to the first photograph  and the second photograph , photographs of the infant  next to the plus bear  may have been taken incrementally each week (e.g., from age three weeks to age eighteen'weeks). The collection of photographs can be displayed to illustrate the growth progression of the infant , week by week, as judged in comparison to the size of the plush bear  and as noted by the age indicated upon, for example, the stomach of the plush bear  each week.Although the photographs  and  picture an infant beside a plush bear, in some implementations, various objects of unchanging size can be photographed beside an object capable of growth. In some examples, a plant, an animal, or a crystal garden can be positioned adjacent to an object of unchanging size such as a toy, figurine, or small furnishing (e.g., lamp, clock, etc.) including one or more connection elements used to removably attach one or more age indicators. In some implementations, rather than using interchangeable numerals on the object, the numerals can be programmed into a digital display attached to or integral with the object.illustrate example apparatus for documenting growth progression. The apparatus, for example, can be marked with removably attachable indicators providing a date or an age. The apparatus can then be placed near an infant or other object capable of growth and photographed.As shown in , a plush bear  is dressed in a shirt  with a set of pockets . The shirt  has been marked above the pockets  with the word “WEEK”. A digit , has been placed in each of the respective pockets and , indicating, for example, the age of an object capable of growth in terms of weeks.The pockets, for example, can be made of clear or semi-transparent material such as plastic, nylon, thin silk, organza, netting, or tiffany. The digits can be made of a rigid, semi-rigid, or flexible material such as, in some examples, plastic, wood, metal, fabric, or a combination thereof. In some implementations, the digits can each be provided to an infant as an individual toy. For example, the digits and can be included in a set of digits of various textures, fabrics, colors, or materials each to respectively be used as an infant toy.Although the shirt  is marked with the word “WEEK”, in other implementations, the digits  can be used to indicate a different set timeframe, such as days, months, or years. Rather than being printed with the word “WEEK”, for example, the shirt  could include an attachment point for a removably attachable set of terms, such as “DAY”, “MONTH”, or “YEAR”.In some implementations, rather than the shirt , another item of apparel can include attachment features for removably attaching one or more indicators. For example, a hat, jacket, or outfit (e.g., pajamas, onesie, or jumpsuit) can include transparent or semi-transparent pockets, hook and loop fasteners, buttons, snaps, or other elements for attaching indicators.In another example, as shown in , a school bus  (e.g., three dimensional toy, two dimensional figurine or photo frame on a stand) includes two sets of rails  configured to support one or more tiles used to indicate information regarding an object capable of growth. The information, in some examples, can include age, height, or weight. An object capable of growth can be placed near the school bus  and photographed to document growth progression of the object. In some examples, the tiles can slide between each set of rails , or the rails  can be used as guides for placement of magnetic indicators.As illustrated, a first set of rails includes tiles indicating the message “KATY 22 MONTHS 3 WEEKS”, and a second set of rails includes tiles indicating the message “26 INCHES 24 POUNDS 10 OUNCES”. Tiles can be provided with the school bus  including individual letters, as illustrated in the name “KATY” or specific words, as illustrated in the terms “MONTHS”, “WEEKS”, “INCHES”, “POUNDS”, and “OUNCES”. Individual numerals can similarly be provided with the school bus  to represent current age, height, or weight.illustrates an example system  for documenting growth progression. The system  includes a plush bear , a set of indicators , a photo frame , and a photo album . The photo frame  and the photo album  include decorations similar to the plush bear . The system , for example, could be marketed and sold as a set for the purposes of collecting and displaying a series of photographs of an object capable of growth, such as an infant. The infant, for example, could be placed near the plush bear  with one or more of the indicators , attached to the plush bear , indicating a current age of the infant.The plush bear  includes a set of hook and loop fastener strips for removably attaching the indicators  to the plush bear . The indicators , for example, can each include matching hook and fastener strips on the back. The indicators  can be arranged on the hook and loop fastener strips to indicate an age, represented by one or more digit indicators and, optionally, one or more time reference terms , such as “WEEK”, “WEEKS”, “MONTH”, “MONTHS”, “YEAR”, or “YEARS”. For example, the message “1 YEAR 10 MONTHS 2 WEEKS” can be arranged on the plush bear  using the indicators .A series of photographs, taken of an infant next to the plush bear , can be arranged in the photo album . Additionally, one of the photographs, such as the most recent photograph, can be displayed in the photo album .While this description contains many specifics, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of what is being claimed or of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features specific to particular implementations. For example, although the system  is described in terms of documenting the growth progression of an infant next to a plush bear, other systems can include a decorative watering can with removably attachable indicators for documenting the growth of a plant or a fire hydrant figurine with removably attachable indicators for documenting the growth of a puppy. Certain features that are described in this description in the context of separate implementations can also be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single implementation can also be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a subcombination.Thus, particular implementations have been described. Other implementations are within the scope of the following claims."

Greeting cards have been made in conventional configurations such as two-panel gatefold cards with a single fold line between two panels or multiple panels. More recently, greeting cards have been enhanced by incorporating light, sound, electronics or other special effects, although primarily in combination with conventional flat panel greeting cards.An interactive greeting card operative to move between a first position wherein several interconnected panels are folded into a substantially flat position and a second position wherein the several interconnected panels are unfolded into a three-dimensional pop-up structure. Movement between the first and second positions may also control playback of digital audio, activation of one or more LED lights, or various other special effects. An inner sentiment panel is substantially contained within an outer greeting card body and is revealed when the greeting card is moved from the first to the second position. Various openings on the greeting card panels accommodate movement and visibility of the inner sentiment panel.The greeting card of the present disclosure and related inventions is a three-dimensional “push and pop” musical greeting card. The greeting card is capable of being in a first position wherein the card is folded flat and a second position, wherein the card is unfolded into a three-dimensional structure. The card is moved from the first position to the second position by “pushing” down on a particular area of the card and watching the various card panels “pop” into a three-dimensional figure. The greeting card may also contain electronics that provide light, sound or other special effects.In a preferred embodiment, the greeting card of the present invention resembles a house or a “café”. The various components of the greeting card construct are shown in . Preferably, the greeting card material is paperboard or other similarly strong but lightweight material. While separate and distinct greeting card panels are shown and described herein, two or more components can be combined into a single panel. The outer greeting card construct is shown in . It includes a plurality of panels connected along a plurality of fold lines, which combine to create the outer or house-like structure. A first main panel A serves as the front of the greeting card. Main panel A is divided into five sub-panels, A, A, A, A, A along fold lines , , , . Sub-panels A and A, which are connected to sub-panel A along fold lines , , serve as a door-like structure, wherein they are operative to pivot about fold lines  and  respectively, simulating an opening/closing motion. On either side of main panel A are main panels D and E. Both main panels D and E are divided into three sub-panels, D, D, D, E, E, E. Panels D and E serve as right and left side panels of the greeting card which partially conceal the various components which are located within the outer greeting card construct. Sub-panels D and D are bisected by fold line  and sub-panels E and E are bisected by fold line . These fold lines allow the sub-panels D/D and E/E to fold inward within the outer card construct so that the greeting card can be completely collapsed into a flat position such that it can be mailed in a traditional greeting card envelope. Sub-panels D and E attached to the inner surface of sub-panel B. Main panel A, and more particularly, sub-panel A is connected to main panel C along fold line . Main panel C is divided equally, along fold line , into sub-panels C and C. Sub-panels C and C are folded outward along fold line  when the greeting card is in the first or folded position. Panel C (C & C) serves as the bottom floor of the greeting card when it is in the second or unfolded position. Main panel C, or more particularly, sub-panel C is connected to main panel B along fold line . Main panel B serves as the back side of the greeting card, which is opposite and parallel to panel A. Panel B is divided into five sections B, B, B, B, B along four fold lines , ,  and . Sub-panel B has an elongate slot or aperture contained thereon to accommodate insertion of a sentiment panel, which will be described in greater detail below. Sub-panels B and B are folded inward along fold lines  and  respectively, and attached to the inside surface of sub-panel B. The inside surface of sub-panel B is attached, adhesively or otherwise, to the inside surface of sub-panel A, thereby inter-connecting main panels A, B, C, D and E to form the outer greeting card construct. Prior to connecting and attaching the various panels to assemble the outer greeting card construct, various inner components must be assembled and attached to the inner surface of main panels A, B and C. The inner components are shown in . A sentiment panel is indicated at reference letter F. Sentiment panel F is divided into three sub-panels F, F, F, which are attached along fold lines  and . Sub-panel F is folded about fold line  and attached, adhesively or otherwise, to sub-panel F such that the inner surface of sub-panels F and F are in direct contact. Sub-panel F serves as the front of the sentiment panel F and sub-panel F serves as the back. Sub-panel F is connected to sub-panel F along fold line  and serves as a base for connected sub-panels F and F. Sub-panel F contains a tab  thereon, which is used to maintain the greeting card in the second or unfolded position. Sub-panel F is attached, adhesively or otherwise, to sub-panel C so that sub-panels F and F are contained between main panel A and main panel B. Sub-panels F and F are also inserted from the inside into the elongate slot or aperture  located on sub-panel B so that a small portion of the sentiment panel F is visible from the back side of the greeting card when the greeting card is in the first or folded position and a larger portion is revealed from the front or back of the greeting card when the greeting card is in the second or unfolded position. The sentiment panel F may contain text sentiment and/or graphics printed thereon. When the greeting card is in the second or unfolded position, a portion the front surface of sub-panel F can be seen through the “doors” or sub-panels A and A, which pivot inward about fold lines  and , respectively to reveal a greeting, a message, picture or scene printed on sub-panel F. Main panel G, which is dived into sub-panels G, G and G is used to conceal the electronic components contained within the outer greeting card structure. The electrical components, described in further detail below, are attached, adhesively or otherwise, to sub-panel C. Main panel G is positioned over the electronic components and attached, adhesively or otherwise, to sub-panel C. Main panels H and J are used to facilitate the opening and closing of the “doors” or sub-panels A and A. Panel H is folded along fold lines  and  to form a u-shaped component. Sub-panel H is attached, adhesively or otherwise, to the inside surface of sub-panel D while sub-panel H is attached to the inside surface of sub-panel A. Likewise, panel J is folded along fold lines  and  to form a u-shaped component. Sub-panel J is then attached to the inside surface of sub-panel E while sub-panel J is attached to the inside surface of sub-panel A. When the greeting card is in a first or folded position, panel H is folded flat between panels D and A and panel J is folded flat between sub-panels E and A. When the greeting card is moved to the second or unfolded position, the side panels D and E are unfolded about fold lines  and  respectively, thereby pulling panels H and J respectively into an unfolded position which moves sub-panels A and AS inward, giving the appearance of a pair of French doors opening inward to reveal a portion of the sentiment panel.Various electronic components may be contained and concealed within the outer greeting card construct, as shown in . As mentioned above, the electronic components may be attached to the floor or main panel C, with a speaker  mounted to the inside surface of panel B. The electronic components may be operative to play sound, activate lights or perform other special effects or a combination thereof. Electronic components may include, but are not limited to: a printed circuit board with microprocessor , an integrated circuit chip, a controller, a power source , a speaker , a switch , a memory device, and one or more digital files stored on the memory device. Any number of other electrical components are contemplated such that the greeting card may be operative to play sound, activate lights, activate motorized moveable components, record messages, accept digital data files from an outside source such as a personal computer, or perform any other special effects. Such components and related circuitry are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. The special effects may be coordinated with the theme of the greeting card. For example, in a preferred embodiment, described herein and shown in the figures, the greeting card resembles a café whereby the shape of the greeting card construct and the related artwork and text printed thereon are used to represent a small cafe. When the greeting card  is moved from the first or folded position to the second or unfolded position, sound may be activated wherein such sound may be an instrumental music clip of something one might hear while in a café. One or more lights, such as LED lights, may also be contained within the outer greeting card construct and may be visible through various apertures contained on the various greeting card panels. Also, lights may be located inside the outer greeting card structure behind a semi-transparent screen such that the light creates a backlight behind the scene revealed on the sentiment panel. Such lights may be activated, along with or instead of activation of the digital audio, when the greeting card is moved from the first or folded position to the second or unfolded position. The lights may be clear white lights or they may be of various colors. Various types or formats of audio files may be contained on a memory device, including but not limited to: MP3, .mp4, AAC, .wav, etc. The various audio files may contain various content including, but not limited to: a spoken greeting, such as a celebrity voice; a music clip such as from a popular song; an instrumental music clip; an animal sound, etc. In one embodiment, the greeting card may be operative to upload digital audio files from an external source via a USB cable or SD card slot contained within the greeting card construct. In another embodiment, the greeting card may be operative to record a personal message from a user. These uploaded audio files or user-recorded messages may be played back upon a greeting card recipient moving the greeting card from the first or folded position into the section or unfolded position. They may also be played in combination, either before, after or simultaneously with a pre-recorded audio saved within memory on the greeting card.In operation, the greeting card  moves from a first position wherein the greeting card  is folded into a substantially flat position, shown in , to a second position wherein the greeting card  is unfolded into a three-dimensional structure, shown in , , and . When the greeting card  is in the first or folded position, it can be inserted into a traditional, standard-sized envelope. To move the greeting card  into the second or unfolded position, a user must take hold of the greeting card, such as between a forefinger and thumb, in the upper region of the card, such as over sub-panels A and B, and push the card in a downward direction. An instructional removable sticker may be placed on sub-panels A or B instructing the user to “push down to pop open”. Pushing the card  in a downward direction, unfolds the various folded panels constructing the three-dimensional café-like structure. This also causes the sentiment panel F to be revealed from the front of the greeting card  through the slot  contained on the back of the greeting card (sub-panel B) and also through the open doors or sub-panels A and A. The sentiment panel F may contain an appropriate thematic scene through sub-panels A and AS such as a small café table and chairs. The upper portion of the sentiment panel F, which is visible over the top of the greeting card  as it comes into view through the slot in sub-panel B, may contain text sentiment, such as “Happy Birthday” or additional artwork or a combination thereof. In addition to revealing the sentiment panel F, moving the greeting card  from the first or folded position to the second or unfolded position may also trigger playback of a digital audio file and/or activation of one or more LED lights contained within the greeting card . The special effects, such as the sound generation and light activation, may be controlled by a slide switch , located along with the other electronic components, on sub-panel C. The tongue portion of the slide switch  may extend, for example, across fold line  between panels C and C such that when the greeting card  is opened or moved from the first or folded position to the second or unfolded position, the tongue portion of the slide switch  is moved thereby allowing power to the circuit. The special effects, such as the audio and/or lights, may be deactivated by placing the greeting card  back into the first or folded position. The greeting card  may be maintained in the second or unfolded position by inserting the bottom edge of the elongate slot  on sub-panel B under the tab  located on sub-panel F. In this case, the special effects, such as the sound generation and/or light activation may turn off or deactivate after the greeting card  remains in the second or unfolded position for a certain period of time, such as  or  seconds or more, to preserve the life of the battery. While a slide switch has been described herein, any type of switch may be used, including, but not limited to: a magnetic switch; a light-sensitive switch; and a touch-sensitive switch.It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described.
